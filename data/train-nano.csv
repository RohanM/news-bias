Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2016,  12:15: Clinton’s campaign think they are attacking Pence’s claim that he was for the Tea Party before it was cool on things like spending. The joke may be on them as Tea Party supporters who did not show up for Romney are much more likely to show up in 2016 for   according to recent polling: An important message from the guy Trump thinks should be VP, Mike Pence: “I was Tea Party before it was cool. ” https:  .   —   The Briefing (@TheBriefing2016) July 16, 2016,  [Tony Lee: Pence is a solid pick, and pundits are already talking about how Pence sounds “presidential” and should be at the top of the ticket. And that “boring” ticket would lose to Clinton just like Romney got trounced by Obama. Trump is much better as a front man. And the polished Pence is a great choice who will do no harm and not make unforced errors. One thing Trump has to be careful going forward, especially since the media and Democrats will be parsing everything he says, is saying things like campaigns pay “millions” for briefing reports. He caught himself today, perhaps now aware that he must be more careful, and said his campaign only pays $10, 000 for the reports. Lost in all of this was Trump’s extremely valid point that his experiences in the real world and dealing with business executives, etc. are more important than what the   “experts” think is important in their “reports” that traditional candidates like Clinton depend on for all of their information. Of course, Trump didn’t literally mean “millions” —  he could have said “gazillions” —  and is speaking like an average American. But these type of comments dealing with other subjects get him in trouble, and he has to be careful when he goes off on tangents.] 11:50: Pence says elections are about choices and Americans can choose a leader who can make America prosperous again and brings real change or a person who “personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D. C. ” Pence blasts  ’s foreign policy and says history teaches us that weakness inspires evil and says the world is spinning apart because of  ’s weakness on foreign policy. 11:49: Pence says he answered the call because he knows from firsthand experience that “strong Republican leadership can bring about real change” just like in his Hoosier State and “Hillary Clinton must never become president of the United States of America. ” 11:48: Pence says he felt like he got to Washington after Reagan’s revolution was over and had to fight both parties on spending. He says he fought for taxpayers and he says he was part of the team that won Congress back from Democrats in 2010 while fighting Democrats on cap and trade and Obamacare. That is one of @mike_pence best arguments  —   he was fighting Bush spending and govt programs while in Congress before it was cool.  —   Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) July 16, 2016,  11:45: Pence says people who know him well know that he’s a “pretty basic guy. ” He says he is a “Christian. Conservative. Republican. In that order. ” He says he’s a   boy who grew up in Indiana with a cornfield in his backyard. He says, like Trump’s family, his family immigrated to America. He says the heroes of his youth were JFK and MLK Jr. He says he started politics as a Democrat and became a Republican because of Reagan. 11:43: Pence now has the stage. He thanks Trump for the “confidence you’ve place in us. And I accept your nomination to serve as vice president of the United States of American. ” Pence says he is grateful to God for His amazing grace and comes with a “humble heart. ” He praises Trump as a “patriotic American” and “fighter” who has set aside his “legendary” business career to make America great again. Pence says Trump is a good man and will make a great president of the United States of America. He says Trump understands the hopes and fears of Americans like nobody since Reagan. Pence says Americans are tired of politicians in both parties saying they’ll solve our problems tomorrow and, citing Reagan, an intellectual elite in Washington telling Americans what to do. 11:40: Trump says Cruz will be speaking at the convention and says even though Pence was under pressure to endorse Cruz, Pence’s endorsement of Cruz was really an endorsement of Trump and was the “    I’ver ever got in my life. ” 11:34: Trump praises Pence’s wife and family. He says Indiana’s unemployment has fallen since Pence became governor while its labor force has increased. He says Pence balanced the budget and produced a surplus. He says people in Washington don’t even know that that means. He also praises Pence’s Indiana’s AAA bond rating (much better than New Jersey’s). He praises Indiana’s school choice program and lauds Pence’s income tax cut, the largest in state history. Trump says Pence cut taxes while balancing the state’s budget. He says Indiana was still ranked 1st in infrastructure. 11:30: Trump talks religious freedom. He says religion’s voice has been “taken away” and “we’re going to change that. ” Trump says ”we’re gonna get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment”  —   ”we’re gonna let people of religion talk.”  —   WTHR. com (@WTHRcom) July 16, 2016,  11:26: Trump ridicules the “Never Trump” movement for getting crushed in Cleveland. Trump says people are tired of the country’s bad trade deals, its lack of borders, high taxes and terrible regulations. 11:25: Trump says one of the big reasons he chose Pence was due to “unity” since he is an “outsider” who won in a landslide that wasn’t even close. 11:23: Trump again reminds voters that Clinton’s policies led to the creation of ISIS. 11:21: Trump says Clinton believes in the “globalism” supported by her donors while he believes in Americanism. “What a difference between Crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence,” he says. “Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy —  radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. ” Trump says “we are the law and order candidates” and “we are the law and order party. ” “We are going to change things around, and there’s going to be respect for law and order,” he says. 11:20: Trump: Hillary Will Pay Price at Polls in November. . @realDonaldTrump: Hillary Clinton will ”pay” the price for handling of emails in November. https:  .   —   ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 16, 2016,  11:18: “I found a leader who will help deliver a safe society and prosperous society for all Americans,” Trump says. He says Pence was his “first choice” and has “admired” the work that he has done in Indiana. He says he’s admired that Pence fights for people “and he’ll fight for you. He’s a solid, solid person. ” Trump says Pence served Indiana with distinction. Trump says Pence is a man of “honesty” and “character” while Hillary Clinton is the “embodiment of corruption” who is “totally bought and paid for by” Wall Street, lobbyists, and special interests. Trump says Clinton “got away with murder” re: her email scandal. Trump not detailing all of Clinton’s “crimes” associated with her   scandal. Trump says while Clinton didn’t pay the price he should have paid, “she’s going to pay that price when November 8 rolls around  …     at the polls. ” 11:17: Trump says the Middle East has been more unstable than ever before after Hillary Clinton led President Barack Obama down “a horrible path. ” “He didn’t know what he was doing,” Trump says of Obama. Trump mentions that Iran is now on the path to obtaining nuclear weapons. He says the unrest in Turkey is further evidence of  ’s failures. Trump says we need to bring back “our industry” in this country that has been “taken away. ” 11:16: Trump says he’s introducing the man who will be his partner to fix the “rigged system” and make America “safe” and “great again. ” Trump says “we witnesses horror beyond belief” while addressing the Islamic terror attack in France. Trump says we need “strength and leadership” and “law and order” in America. Trump also wishes the people in Turkey well. “A lot of anguish last night,” he says. 11:15: Trump takes the stage and says, “it’s a wonderful day. ” He vows that “we’re going to have an incredible convention. ” 11:00: Interesting that the major announcement is being held in New York and not in a swing state that Trump needs. 10:55: Poor Huffington Post.

"Search For Missing Flight MH370 Suspended After Almost 3 Years. The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been suspended after nearly three years of fruitless work. The airplane vanished from radar on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. Since then, nothing has been seen of the plane except for pieces of debris that floated far from the original focus. International search crews have examined more than 45, 000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, where experts initially concluded the plane was most likely to be located, to no avail. The search was suspended Tuesday, NPR’s Anthony Kuhn reports. ”The transportation ministers of Malaysia, China and Australia issued a joint statement, saying that despite their best efforts, the search had come up empty,” Anthony says. ”They added that their decision to suspend the search was not made lightly, or without sadness.” The search had been ”painstaking,” The Associated Press reports, with large ships dragging small vessels equipped with sonar through the ocean just above the seabed, and unmanned submarines examining any areas of interest detected by sonar. But more recent analysis suggested that the plane might never have been in the search area at all. A report suggested it may have been located slightly north  —   in a    section of ocean that hasn’t been searched yet. But the governments organizing and funding the search decided that information wasn’t specific enough to justify expanding the search zone, NPR’s Geoff Brumfiel reports. ”It’s hard for victims’ families to accept that the authorities will not enlarge the search to the north, and that their loved ones may never be found,” Anthony says. Voice370, which represents the family members of the flight’s passengers and crew, issued a statement saying the group was ”dismayed” by the decision. ”Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace,” the group said. ”Stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible.” The search has been suspended unless ”new evidence emerges” that points to the plane’s precise location  —   something beyond the capabilities of current technology, the AP writes. In December, when the report suggesting the plane was farther north was first released, Geoff Brumfiel described what we know about the plane’s fate: ”Fragmentary evidence from military radars and ”pings” from the plane’s own satellite communications system suggested that the Boeing 777 executed a series of turns that eventually led it to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean. Authorities believe it crashed somewhere along a long arc of ocean, after exhausting its fuel supplies. ”In July 2015, a fragment of the plane washed up on the shores of La Réunion, a small island off the African coast. Since that time, more than 20 other pieces of debris have been recovered along beaches in places like Madagascar, Mauritius, Tanzania and South Africa. It has never been clear why the plane crashed in the first place. ”If the plane is never found, the reasons for its disappearance and crash will probably never be known,” the AP writes, ”though Malaysia has said the plane’s erratic movements after takeoff were consistent with deliberate actions.”",-0.5
"Michael Flynn, Anti-Islamist Ex-General, Offered Security Post, Trump Aide Says - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump has offered the post of national security adviser to Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, potentially putting a retired intelligence officer who believes Islamist militancy poses an existential threat in one of the most powerful roles in shaping military and foreign policy, according to a top official on Mr. Trump’s transition team. General Flynn, 57, a registered Democrat, was Mr. Trump’s main national security adviser during his campaign. If he accepts Mr. Trump’s offer, as expected, he will be a critical gatekeeper for a president with little experience in military or foreign policy issues. Mr. Trump and General Flynn both see themselves as brash outsiders who hustled their way to the big time. They both post on Twitter often about their own successes, and they have both at times crossed the line into outright Islamophobia. They also both exhibit a loose relationship with facts: General Flynn, for instance, has said that Shariah, or Islamic law, is spreading in the United States (it is not). His dubious assertions are so common that when he ran the Defense Intelligence Agency, subordinates came up with a name for the phenomenon: They called them “Flynn facts. ” As an adviser, General Flynn has already proved to be a powerful influence on Mr. Trump, convincing the   that the United States is in a “world war” with Islamist militants and must work with any willing allies in the fight, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. During the transition, General Flynn has been present when Mr. Trump has received his daily intelligence briefing. As national security adviser, he would have the last word on how the president should respond to crises such as a showdown with China over the South China Sea or an international health crisis like the Ebola epidemic. But, like Mr. Trump, he would enter the White House with significant baggage. The Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by President Obama as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has hazy business ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government. General Flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and attended the network’s lavish anniversary party in Moscow, where he sat at Mr. Putin’s elbow. Those potential conflicts of interest had led Mr. Trump’s transition team to worry that General Flynn might have difficulty winning confirmation for any post that, unlike the national security adviser role, requires congressional approval, such as director of the C. I. A. But for Mr. Trump, he has one overriding virtue: He was an early and ardent supporter in a campaign during which most of the Washington national security establishment openly called Mr. Trump unfit to lead. General Flynn did not respond to repeated interview requests. Yet in numerous speeches and interviews before the election, and in a book published in August, he laid out a view of the world that sees the United States as facing a singular, overarching threat that can be described in only one way: “radical Islamic terrorism. ” All else is secondary for General Flynn, and any other description of the threat is “the worst kind of political correctness,” he said in an interview three weeks before the election. Islamist militancy poses an existential threat on a global scale, and the Muslim faith itself is the source of the problem, he said, describing it as a political ideology, not a religion. He has even at times gone so far as to call it a political ideology that has “metastasized” into a “malignant cancer. ” For General Flynn, the election of Mr. Trump represents an astounding career turnaround. Once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation, General Flynn was fired after serving only two years as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He then   as a vociferous critic of a Washington elite that he contended could not even properly identify the real enemy  —   radical Islam, that is  —   never mind figure out how to defeat it. In Mr. Trump, General Flynn found someone who was more than willing to listen. He readily signed on to the campaign, and quickly emerged as the angry voice of the national security establishment, leading chants of “lock her up” against Hillary Clinton at rallies and the Republican convention. And now, after months of the two men talking to each other, it can be hard to tell where Mr. Trump’s views end and General Flynn’s begin. They both believe that the United States needs to start working with Mr. Putin to defeat Islamist militants and stop worrying about his suppression of critics at home, his attempt to dismember Ukraine or the Russian military’s indiscriminate bombing of Syrian cities. The same goes for President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt, who took power in a coup and who was the first world leader to speak with Mr. Trump after the election. Mr. Trump “looks at people and leaders of countries and says: ‘Can I work with this guy? Do we have a common threat that we can focus on? ’” Mr. Flynn said in the interview before the election. “He knows that when it comes to Russia or any other country, the common enemy that we all have is radical Islam. ” General Flynn and Mr. Trump also agree that the United States needs to sharply curtail immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, and possibly even force American Muslims to register with the government. The similarities run beyond political views. Like the boy from Queens who made it in Manhattan, General Flynn came into the military without a West Point pedigree  —   he graduated from the Army’s Reserve Officer Training Program at the University of Rhode Island  —   and earned a reputation as outspoken and unconventional as he climbed the ranks to the top of military intelligence. Yet General Flynn still nurses the grudge of an outsider, believing he never quite got the respect he deserves. For example, he has attributed his dismissal from the Defense Intelligence Agency to a pair of consummate insiders: James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, and Michael Vickers, the undersecretary of defense intelligence. His response, like that of his new boss, has been to buck the establishment. In his view, both the Republican and the Democratic luminaries who have shaped American defense and foreign policy through two presidencies have “gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons. ” “I would argue with that crowd all day long,” he said before the election. Among the   Republicans who now dominate the party, General Flynn has become something of a cult figure for what they see as his brave stand against the Obama administration’s perfidy. General Flynn insists that he was fired from the intelligence agency because he refused to toe the administration’s line that Islamist militants were in retreat. (He was right, in all fairness.) “He’s an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing   chess,” said Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a close confidant to Mr. Flynn. “He was the one who called out the administration for being wrong on Al Qaeda. ” But many of those who worked with General Flynn attribute his firing to management problems, saying his attempts to overhaul the sprawling agency had left it a chaotic, backbiting mess. They also question whether his tactical acumen  —   he was especially good at unraveling militant networks in Afghanistan and Iraq  —   can translate into the kind of strategic thinking needed at the White House. “He is a very talented information gatherer,” said Sarah Chayes of the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, who worked with General Flynn when he ran military intelligence in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. “But his thinking process is not sufficiently analytical to test some streams against others and make sense of it, or draw consistent conclusions,” she said. “If you listen to him, in 10 minutes you’ll hear him contradict himself two or three times. ” Take his views on Islam. In the interview before the election, he characterized Islam as intolerant. Then he said that he had many Muslim friends, and that the United States needed to do a better job of understanding Islamic culture and fostering its tolerant side.",-1.0
"Blood test could tailor treatment for depression.  (CNN) A blood test could help doctors tailor treatments for depression    by identifying which drugs will be most effective in each patient. According to a recent study, an analysis of blood samples can highlight high levels of inflammation in a patient and help predict which drugs may not be effective. Other recent studies have found a link between increased inflammation and lower success rates from treatment. Identifying this increase up front can help predict which people may need more aggressive treatment early on. Currently, treatment for depression involves a process of trial and error, with doctors prescribing a particular drug for periods of up to 12 weeks and monitoring patients for any improvement. If no response is seen, a new drug, or combination of drugs, is tried until one is found to be effective. ”If [patients] don’t get better, they just switch drugs and then switch again with hope that one will work,” said Carmine Pariante, professor of biological psychiatry at Kings College London, who developed the test and led the study. Depression is among the most prominent mental health conditions globally, with an estimated 350 million affected worldwide. Although treatment for the condition can vary, the most common treatment, particularly in industrialized countries, is the prescription of antidepressant drugs. But it is estimated that half of all patients with depression will not respond to   antidepressants. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Zoloft (sertraline) Paxil (paroxetine) and Prozac (fluoxetine).  ”This blood test could cut down this time [in which] people don’t respond,” Pariante said. Searching for inflammation, To test the effectiveness of its blood test, the team used it on 140 patients with depression before they began a course of treatment. They tested for two biological markers in their blood    known as MIF and (IL)  β     and found   of people in the study to have levels of these markers above a chosen threshold for inflammation.  This same third then failed to respond to any   drugs. ”We determined with 100% accuracy when patients will not respond to these   drugs,” Pariante said. ”This   need a more complex intervention.” Complementing this finding was the fact that people with the lowest level of inflammation were the most responsive to treatment.  However, the team acknowledges the small scale of the trial and the need to use the blood test in a   clinical setting, such as a hospital, to see its true potential. ”We want to test the ability of our blood test to improve quality of care,” Pariante said. Currently, the team is further exploring the role of inflammation by testing the potential for   drugs to be combined with antidepressants in order to improve treatment. Inflaming depression, The link between inflammation and the severity of depression has been known for some time, thanks to previous studies by Pariante and other experts in the field. ”The study clearly identifies the connection between inflammation and depression,” said Eva Redei, professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences and physiology at Northwestern University. Research by her team has also used blood tests to identify factors relating to depression, including markers to actually diagnose when someone has depression.  Her team used ”  biomarkers to distinguish depressed patients from   healthy controls . .. [but] some of our biomarkers were also related to inflammation,” she said. Inflammation is thought to affect the same mechanisms targeted by antidepressants, interfering with their success, and to increase the production of toxic compounds in the brain that can increase depressive symptoms. Finding ways to test for this inflammation is therefore likely to be beneficial in treating patients.  ”The two markers the authors investigated can predict, to some degree, the treatment efficacy of antidepressants,” Redei said. Combining body and mind, ”The study also raises interesting questions regarding the comorbidity of depression with generalized inflammation,” Redei said.  Along with Pariente, she is eager to find ways to treat people suffering from depression more effectively. They both believe it is important that clinicians recognize that depression is about more than just the mind. The new study ”highlights the importance of physical health in the context of depression,” Pariante said. Inflammation can be a result of various health issues, including infections and conditions such as diabetes.  ”The body can participate in the severity of the depression and the responsiveness to antidepressants,” Pariante said. For now, the findings remain limited, but offer new avenues for improving treatment in the future. ”We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done,” said Stephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind.  ”Different people will find that different treatments help to manage their mental health. What is most important is that people have the knowledge needed to access the treatment that works for them, whether this is medication or alternatives such as talking therapies or a mixture of both.”",-1.0
"Snowden and WikiLeaks Clash Over How to Disclose Secrets - The New York Times. They may both support the dissemination of government secrets, but Edward J. Snowden and WikiLeaks seem to disagree on how best to do it. On Thursday, Mr. Snowden, the former government contractor who released a trove of National Security Agency documents and now lives in exile in Russia, credited WikiLeaks, a clearinghouse for similar disclosures, with furthering the cause of transparency but also criticized its unfiltered approach. His words prompted a swift and cutting reply from WikiLeaks, which had once come to his aid. Mr. Snowden, it suggested, was trying to ingratiate himself with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, just days after WikiLeaks had released embarrassing emails showing that Democratic Party officials had derided the campaign of her main rival in the primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. WikiLeaks is often criticized for releasing documents without editing or regard for the sensitive information they may contain. Mr. Snowden, on the other hand, has said that he chose to work with journalists in 2013 to selectively release the N. S. A. documents in order to limit the harmful consequences of exposing what he called the abuses of government surveillance. The exchange on Thursday was all the more striking in light of the past collaboration between Mr. Snowden and the group, which helped him as he sought to find a place to settle into exile. In June 2013, a WikiLeaks activist accompanied him as he made his way from Hong Kong to Moscow, a week after WikiLeaks’ founder, Julian Assange, encouraged the government of Ecuador to accept Mr. Snowden’s asylum request. “Mr. Snowden requested our expertise and assistance,” Mr. Assange said at the time. “We’ve been involved in very similar legal and diplomatic and geopolitical struggles to preserve the organization and its ability to publish. ”",-1.0
"Desmond Tutu: I want right to end my life through assisted dying. Desmond Tutu has said he would like the option of ending his life through assisted dying as he called on politicians, lawmakers and religious leaders to take action on the issue. In an article published on his 85th birthday on Friday, and following several spells in hospital this year for recurring infections, the emeritus archbishop of Cape Town and   activist reiterated his support for assisted dying, first disclosed in the Guardian in 2014. “With my life closer to its end than its beginning, I wish to help give people dignity in dying,” he wrote in the Washington Post. “Just as I have argued firmly for compassion and fairness in life, I believe that terminally ill people should be treated with the same compassion and fairness when it comes to their deaths,” he added. “Dying people should have the right to choose how and when they leave Mother Earth. I believe that, alongside the wonderful palliative care that exists, their choices should include a dignified assisted death. ” Tutu had changed his mind over assisted suicide two years ago after a lifelong opposition but had remained ambiguous about whether he personally would choose such a death. He said: “Today, I myself am even closer to the departures hall than arrivals, so to speak, and my thoughts turn to how I would like to be treated when the time comes. Now more than ever, I feel compelled to lend my voice to this cause. ” He believed in the sanctity of life but also that terminally ill people should not be forced to endure terrible pain and suffering, he wrote. Instead they should have control over the manner and timing of their death. He added: “I have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs. I hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life’s journey in the manner of my choice. ” Tutu pointed to laws in California and Canada that permit assisted dying for terminally ill people. But “there are still many thousands of dying people across the world who are denied their right to die with dignity”. He said: “For those suffering unbearably and coming to the end of their lives, merely knowing that an assisted death is open to them can provide immeasurable comfort. ” He concluded: “In refusing dying people the right to die with dignity, we fail to demonstrate the compassion that lies at the heart of Christian values. I pray that politicians, lawmakers and religious leaders have the courage to support the choices terminally ill citizens make in departing Mother Earth. The time to act is now. ” Tutu, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1984, has been admitted to hospital several times, most recently in September, for recurring infections as a result of surgery for prostate cancer. Assisted dying is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Albania, Colombia and Japan as well as Canada. Several US states have enacted measures on assisted dying, including Washington, California, Oregon, Vermont and New Mexico. In September last year, the UK parliament rejected a bill to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill, with 330 MPs voting against it and 118 backing the measure, despite an opinion poll showing it was supported by 82% of the public. The same poll suggested that 44% of people would break the law to help a loved one to die, risking a jail sentence of up to 14 years. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who sits in the House of Lords, urged MPs to reject the bill along with other faith leaders. Former archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey has argued for assisted dying to be lawful, saying such a move would be “profoundly Christian and moral”. Tutu wrote: “His initiative has my blessing and support  —   as do similar initiatives in my home country, South Africa, throughout the United States and across the globe. ” Tutu has also been a vocal advocate for women’s rights, a staunch opponent of homophobia, a campaigner on poverty, for people with   and on climate change. He headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in   South Africa. Nelson Mandela described him as the “voice of the voiceless”.",-0.5
"Canada’s Mounties Say Female Officers Can Wear Hijabs. Updated at 10:55 a. m. ET on Aug. 25. Canada’s national police force says it is allowing women in its ranks to wear the hijab. A spokesman confirmed Wednesday that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, known as the Mounties, recently approved the headscarf for its Muslim officers. ”This is intended to better reflect the diversity in our communities and encourage more Muslim women to consider the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as a career option,” Scott Bardsley, spokesman for Canada’s public safety minister, told the   Global News. Bardsley said other police forces in Canada have made similar religious accommodations, as have countries such as the U. S. U. K. Sweden and Norway. In fact, Scotland’s police force announced this week that the hijab is now an optional part of the uniform. ”I hope that this addition to our uniform options will contribute to making our staff mix more diverse and adds to the life skills, experiences and personal qualities that our officers and staff bring to policing the communities of Scotland,” Chief Constable Phil Gormley, head of the Scottish police, said in a statement announcing the change. Here’s more from Global News on the new options for Canada’s Royal Mounted Police: ”Three types of hijabs were tested last month before one was approved, according to an internal memo between Goodale and RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, obtained by Montreal’s La Presse. The memo also said the hijab could be removed quickly if needed, and did not pose a risk to officers.” The Mounties, easily recognized by their scarlet jackets and   hats, trace their history  —   and uniform  —   to the late 1800s, when recruits formed the   Mounted Police and headed west to stop an illegal American whiskey trade. Women were allowed to join as uniformed members in 1974. And an RCMP assessment of gender in 2012 found that women represented 20 percent of the force’s 19, 258 regular members. La Presse reports that the RCMP has received some 30 requests for cultural or religious accommodations over the past two years  —   mostly from male officers wanting to grow beards. The hijab is not the first religious or cultural garment approved for RCMP officers. In 1990, Global News writes, ”the RCMP made the controversial decision to allow Sikh officers to wear turbans as part of their uniforms.” In the U. S. the Defense Department relaxed rules to allow    religious exceptions for military dress in 2014, as The   reported at the time.",-0.5
"US will investigate aluminum imports as national security hazard | TheHill. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Wednesday evening that the U.S. is launching an investigation into whether a deluge of aluminum imports from countries such as Russia and China is threatening national security.  Ross said the Trump administration is ""reacting to real-world conditions"" that imports of aluminum have been steadily rising in the past few years while U.S. producers have experienced job losses and plant closings.  “Imports have been flooding into the aluminum industry,” Ross told reporters during a White House briefing.  He said that actions prove how President Trump is making good on vows made during his run for the White House to get tough on trade, so “this follows quite logically that he is following through with his campaign promises.” Trump is trying to show some forward progress on a slew of trade policy initiatives as the end of his first 100 days in office rapidly approaches. This is the second national security study that Trump has recently ordered, and Ross said more could be on the way for other industries such as imports of semiconductors.  Last week, Trump called on Ross to investigate whether steel imports from countries like China are jeopardizing national security. The president will sign the latest order on Thursday to determine whether tariffs need to be levied. Trump's plans to build up the military are once again playing heavily into the administration's decision to investigate whether certain imports endanger national security. Concern is brewing because there is only one U.S. smelter remaining that produces high-purity aluminum used for building planes such as the F-35, F-18 and C-17 as well as armor plating for military vehicles and some missiles, Ross said. ""It's very, very dangerous, obviously from a national defense point of view, to only have one supplier of an absolutely critical material,"" he told reporters. He noted that the one plant remaining had already filed a trade case against dumping. Overall, eight smelters have closed or curbed production since 2015 in response to the foreign influx of aluminum, Ross said. While Ross criticized China's role for depressing the global aluminum market, he maintained that the latest investigation isn't “China-phobic” and that countries such as Russia and Canada sell significant amounts of the metal here.  China accounts for only 6.2 percent of all aluminum imports compared with, for example, Russia's 12.2 percent.  Still, Canada easily leads the way, sending in more than 3 million of the 6.5 million tons the U.S. imported last year, significantly more than Russia or China.  Before leaving office in January, President Obama's U.S. trade representative, Michael FromanMichael B.G.

That decision was widely praised by Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.  But Ross said a decision about whether the case would be pursued by the new administration would largely be determined by the outcome of this new investigation. “As you know, there’s been a lot of discussion by the president about the WTO and our collective frustration with some of the rules that they have,"" Ross said. ""We are going to act based on our view as to what are the proper rules and our view as to who's violating those rules — and the WTO will do what they do."" View the discussion thread.

"Germany’s Merkel Hits Back After Trump Predicts Shrinking European Union. AFP  —   German Chancellor Angela Merkel led a sharp European response to US   Donald Trump Monday after he branded NATO “obsolete” and said more countries would leave the EU after Britain. [In a   interview with two European newspapers, Trump unleashed a volley of verbal attacks on Europe and criticised Merkel’s “catastrophic” decision to open Germany’s borders to Syrian refugees.  With fears growing in Europe over Trump’s commitment to the transatlantic alliance and over signs he will pivot towards Russia, Merkel warned that the continent now had to take responsibility for itself. “We Europeans have our fate in our own hands,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin when asked about Trump’s criticisms, adding that she will work towards getting the EU to strengthen the economy and fight terrorism. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini dismissed Trump’s prediction of further fractures, saying: “I think the European Union will stick together  —   I’m 100 percent convinced of this. ” French President Francois Hollande meawhile urged the United States under Trump “not to be scared of itself, or the world”.  —   ‘Astonishment and agitation’  —   Trump’s latest remarks have in particular caused further consternation among eastern European NATO countries nervous about Moscow following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and involvement in Ukraine. “I said a long time ago that NATO had problems,” Trump told The Times of London and Bild, Germany’s   daily, on Friday. “Number one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago,” he said, referring to its Cold War,   War II origins. “Number two, the countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to pay. ” On the campaign trail, Trump said he would think twice about helping NATO allies if the United States was not “reasonably reimbursed” for the costs of defending them  —   a common source of friction in the     alliance. German Foreign Minister   Steinmeier said Europe was stunned by Trump’s remarks on NATO, just five days ahead of the billionaire businessman’s inauguration as president. “The interview statements of the American    …     caused, indeed here in Brussels, astonishment and agitation,” Steinmeier said as he went from a meeting with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg to talks with EU counterparts. Stoltenberg was “absolutely confident” in Trump’s commitment to NATO, the alliance chief’s spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said.  —   ‘Catastrophic mistake’  —   Trump however further extended a hand to Russia, which has been hit by a string of sanctions under President Barack Obama over its involvement in Ukraine, the Syrian war and for suspected cyber attacks to influence the US election. “Let’s see if we can make some good deals with Russia,” Trump said, suggesting in vague terms a deal in which nuclear arsenals would be reduced and sanctions against Moscow eased. Underscoring the Obama administration’s very different stance, US   Joe Biden made a farewell trip to Ukraine on Monday to show support for the   country. In another comment that alarmed the Europeans, Trump refused to say that he trusted Merkel more than Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom the next US president has often expressed admiration. “Well, I start off trusting both  —   but let’s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all,” he said. Trump also directly criticised Merkel for letting Germany admit undocumented migrants, insinuating that this posed a security risk following a wave of Islamic State jihadist attacks in Europe. “I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals, you know taking all of the people from wherever they come from,” Trump said, adding he had “great respect” for the chancellor. Trump went on to threaten punitive 35 percent tariffs on German carmakers like BMW if they build cars in Mexico and not the United States.  —   Brexit a ‘great thing’  —   In other remarks, Trump said Brexit “is going to end up as a great thing” and he backed a trade deal with   Britain which would be “good for both sides”. “We’re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly,” said Trump, confirming he will meet British Prime Minister Theresa May soon after his inauguration on Friday. The British pound took a hit Monday after Britain said it might undercut the EU economically if it cannot obtain both single market access and immigration controls, with British media warning of a   “hard Brexit”. “Other countries will leave” the EU in future, Trump predicted, largely due to the pressure the bloc was put under following a surge in arrivals of migrants and refugees fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere. Mogherini however said it was “absolutely clear” that Britain could not start any trade talks with the United States until it leaves the bloc.",1.0
"I’m a Doctor. If I Drop Food on the Kitchen Floor, I Still Eat It. - The New York Times. You may have read or heard about the study debunking the   rule. It said that no matter how fast you pick up food that falls on the floor, you will pick up bacteria with it. Our continued focus on this threat has long baffled me. Why are we so worried about the floor? So many other things are more dangerous than that. I first became interested in the   rule years ago, when I was a   of a book on medical myths. We cited a number of studies showing that food that touched household surfaces  —   even for brief periods of time  —   could pick up bacteria or other harmful substances. This most recent study was similar in that it tested a variety of foods, a variety of substances, for various periods. And, like those other studies, this one found that food touching the floor, even for a very short amount of time, could pick up bacteria. There’s no magic period of time that prevents transmission. But even though I know bacteria can accumulate in less than five seconds, I will still eat food that has fallen on my kitchen floor. Why? Because my kitchen floor isn’t really that dirty. Our metric shouldn’t be whether there are more than zero bacteria on the floor. It should be how many bacteria are on the floor compared with other household surfaces. And in that respect, there are so many places in your house that pose more of a concern than the floor. Perhaps no one in the United States has spent more time investigating the occurrence of bacteria on public surfaces than Charles Gerba. He’s a professor of microbiology and environmental sciences at the University of Arizona, and he has published many papers on the subject. In 1998, he and his colleagues investigated how well cleaning products could reduce coliform bacteria counts on household surfaces. As part of that research, they measured various locations in the house before any cleaning. They found that the kitchen floor was likely to harbor, on average, about three colonies per square inch of coliform bacteria (2. 75 to be exact). So there are some. But here’s the thing  —   that’s cleaner than both the refrigerator handle (5. 37 colonies per square inch) and the kitchen counter (5. 75 colonies per square inch). We spend so much time worrying about what food might have picked up from the floor, but we don’t worry about touching the refrigerator. We also don’t seem as worried about food that touches the counter. But the counter is just as dirty, if not dirtier. The same thing happens in the bathroom. I know a lot of people who are worried about the toilet seat, but it’s cleaner than all the things in the kitchen I just mentioned (0. 68 colonies per square inch). What’s dirtier in the bathroom? Almost everything. The flush handle (34. 65 colonies per square inch) the sink faucet (15. 84 colonies per square inch) and the counter (1. 32 colonies per square inch). Things get dirty when lots of hands touch them and when we don’t think about it. We worry about the floor and the toilet seat, so we clean them more. We don’t think about the refrigerator handle or the faucet handle as much. If we carry this logic out further, there are things we handle a lot and never really clean. One study, for instance, found that about 95 percent of mobile phones carried by health care workers were contaminated with nosocomial bacteria. Of those contaminated with staph aureus, more than half were contaminated with methicillin resistant bacteria (MRSA). Think about how many people have handled the money in your wallet. A study of   bills found that 94 percent were colonized by bacteria, 7 percent of which were pathogenic to healthy people and 87 percent of which were pathogenic to people who were hospitalized or who had compromised immune systems. Where do you keep your money? In a wallet or purse? When did you last clean it? It’s probably filthy. I see people pay for food every day and then eat what they’re handed with no concern that the food might have been contaminated. And the money and the hands that just held it could be much dirtier than the floor. There are so many studies out there showing that things we touch every day are so, so dirty. Gas pump handles. A. T. M. buttons. Remote controls. Light switches. Computer keyboards. The dirtiest thing in your kitchen, by far, is likely to be the sponge you keep near the sink. Most people almost never wash or disinfect those sponges. Mr. Gerba found they had, on average, more than 20 million colonies per square inch. All of this should remind you that it’s always a good idea to wash your hands before you eat.   is still one of the best ways to prevent illness. People react to news like this in one of two ways. One is to become paranoid about everything. Such people start to clean compulsively, worry about all the things they’re touching, and use hand sanitizer obsessively. The alternative is to realize that for most of us, our immune systems are pretty hardy. We’ve all been touching this dirty stuff for a long time, without knowing it, and doing just fine. I clearly fall into the latter group. If I drop food on the floor, I still eat it. I do that because the harm I might get from the floor is not worth my concern compared with many, many other things. You may feel differently. Either way, make an informed judgment based on relative risks, not on any arbitrary span of time that one thing has been touching another.",-1.0

Tens of thousands of Hmong followed, direct from Thai refugee camps. Thao embraced the small, scenic city of Wausau as his new home. The area was mainly a   community that was also known nationally for its paper mills and insurance company. Thao loved the Wisconsin River, which split the city in half. He wanted to love the people, too, but the locals didn’t exactly welcome him. Despite being a war veteran, many people confused him with the enemy —  assuming he was Vietnamese or, worse, Viet Cong. Thao says he sometimes had to remind people he fought for freedom, not communism. “Even today,” he said. “People don’t know why the Hmong are in Wisconsin, and coworkers, they don’t care to know why we are here. We couldn’t stay in our country because of our involvement with the white man. We’ve given Americans 100 percent of our heart, but they’ve only given us 20 percent. ” Continue reading here. 1.

"How I went from a hippie living in a commune to a high-powered ad exec—commentary. In the early 90's, I was living in an intentional community off of a dirt road in western Massachusetts, learning about eastern medicine, organic gardening and myself. Today, I sit today at 200 Fifth Avenue, running internal culture and external marketing for Grey Advertising as director of reputation management. I didn't know it at the time, but my future career and life's purpose was developing even while living among hippies – one based on people, community, culture and communications. My early goal, to be a writer sharing the importance of alternative living, eating and thinking, led me to New York City, where I pursued a master's program in journalism at New York University. Writing about music and culture led to my first job, working in creative development at VH1 and Viacom, and then on to employee number one at a young music company with some big names behind it. (Ever heard of Garth Brooks?) Yet just when I thought I found my footing as a young music executive, I lost my job in the early 2000s. Thank you, digital revolution. The mass music business exodus began, and with it, I found myself shifting from managing and representing artists, to publicizing them. I spent the remainder of my 20's and early 30's in marketing and PR for songwriters and bands ranging from Billy Idol to the Buzzcocks. To me, there was nothing that universally connected people more than music. I ultimately chose to graduate from rock stars to tech stars (which felt a little bit like growing up) as my passions evolved to focus on how great ideas (much like great musical experiences) can change the world. And so I dived into the blossoming New York tech community, helping publicize the launch of a slew of social networks and technology solution companies, including Russell Simmons' GlobalGrind, Vibe Media Group, ParentSociety/Cutekid.com, CPX Interactive and more. And yet, even armed with 10 years of experience, I confronted another job loss in 2009 when the boutique agency I worked for was pummeled by the Great Recession. Gathering up my virtual rolodex, two loyal clients and a whole lot of chutzpah, I decided to launch my own PR firm out of my second bedroom. For the next six years, I built a business working with creative companies, entrepreneurs and innovators ranging including Northside Media Group and Festival, Lippincott, Man Made Music, SESAC, Young Woo & Associates and more. In 2015, Grey Group knocked on my door and I walked through theirs. I was ready for a new, perhaps bigger challenge - the opportunity to market a global organization working among some of the most creative business leaders in the world and my journey prepared me for the task. Here are my five top tips for surviving job loss, switching careers and thriving in any industry: I'm now a year into my transition from boutique PR agency owner to advertising executive. I've spent time learning the goals and needs of my executive team, colleagues and larger agency community in order to build Grey's programs and marketing strategy. But what I find most fascinating is how my early life experiences on a commune and traveling the world, not only resonate, but also drive my current professional philosophy. I may now live in an urban jungle and shudder at the thought of going without wifi, but at my core, I'm still just a hippie on a mission to bring together great people through culture, community and the next big idea.

"Alex Tizon, Journalist Who Wrote of Alienation as Asian-American, Dies at 57 - The New York Times. Alex Tizon, a Pulitzer   reporter whose   2014 memoir documented his insecurities and alienation as a   was found dead on March 23 in his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 57. His wife, Melissa, said that he had died in his sleep and that the cause had not yet been determined. At The Seattle Times, where he shared a Pulitzer in investigative reporting in 1997, and later at The Los Angeles Times, where he was Seattle bureau chief, Mr. Tizon (pronounced  ) was admired as a prose stylist and was known for long, deeply reported articles. He wrote of his own life in “Big Little Man: In Search of My Asian Self. ” In the book, he addressed many of the stereotypes he had internalized as an   having experienced them “as a set of suspicions that seemed corroborated by everyday life. ” “When did this shame inside me begin?” he wrote. “Looking back now, I could say it began with love. Love of the gifted people and their imagined life love of America, the sprawling idea of it, with its gilded tentacles reaching across the Pacific Ocean to wrap around the hearts of small brown people living small brown lives. It was a love bordering on worship, fueled by longing, felt most fervently by those like my parents who grew up with America in their dreams. The love almost killed us. ” Mr. Tizon’s memoir detailed his struggle to find masculine Asian role models in Western popular culture and his childhood attempts to make himself look whiter. He recalled dangling from trees to stretch his vertebrae and pinching his nose with a clothespin to narrow it. “‘Big Little Man’ is an unflinchingly honest, at times beautifully written, often discomforting examination of Tizon’s remarkable, yet thoroughly relatable, life,” Jay Caspian Kang wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Tizon said in an online interview with The Boston Globe last year that he thought life had grown better for  . “I have nephews who are just worldbeaters,” he said. “They read my book, and yeah, they can relate to some of it. But a sense of inferiority? No. That’s just not there. ” Michele Matassa Flores, the managing editor of The Seattle Times, said in a phone interview that as a reporter Mr. Tizon “focused on the gray” rather than seeing the world in black and white. “The world was not a simple place for Alex,” she added, “and he wanted to convey that to his readers. ” On one assignment Mr. Tizon rode through the streets of Seattle with a gang during a period of growing violence in the city in the late 1980s. He also wrote a series of profiles, “Crossing America: Dispatches From a New Nation,” for which he traveled across the country with the photographer Alan Berner after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Tizon, along with Eric Nalder and Deborah Nelson, won the Pulitzer Prize for articles about problems facing a Department of Housing and Urban Development program to help Native Americans build homes. The articles chronicled dysfunction and incompetence within the department, corruption and nepotism at the tribal level, and misallocation of funds at Indian reservations around the country. In many cases, the articles showed, the result was overcrowded hovels for most and   mansions for a connected few. “It is not much more than a large plywood box, this house Thelma Moses calls home,” one article began. “To stand outside it is to wonder how such dimensions  —   10 feet by 12 feet  —   can enclose a life. ” The series resulted in a congressional investigation and changes in the federal program. Tomas Alexander Tizon was born in Manila on Oct. 30, 1959. His parents, Francisco Tizon and the former Leticia Asuncion, used borrowed money to bring their family to Los Angeles in 1964. The Tizon family lived in Seattle and the South Bronx before settling in Oregon. Alex graduated from high school in Salem, Ore. in 1977 and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Oregon. He received a master’s degree in journalism from Stanford University in 1986, the year he joined The Seattle Times. Mr. Tizon left The Los Angeles Times in 2008, and in 2011 he began teaching at the University of Oregon in Eugene and writing freelance articles for national publications, including The Atlantic. In addition to his wife, the former Melissa Quiason, with whom he lived in Eugene and Seattle, he is survived by their daughter, Maya Tizon a daughter from an earlier marriage, Dylan Tizon two brothers, Art and Albert and six sisters, Leticia Tizon, Maria   Maria   Nikki Walker, Toni Tizon and Giselle  .",-1.0
"Google researchers aim to prevent AIs from discriminating – TechCrunch. Garbage in, garbage out — that’s always been a rule of computing, and machine learning systems are no exception. These elementary AIs only know what we tell them, and if that data carries a bias of any kind, so too will the system trained on it. Google is looking to avoid such awkward and potentially serious situations systematically with a method it calls “Equality of Opportunity.” Machine learning systems are basically prediction engines that learn the characteristics of various sets of data and then, given a new bit of data, assign it to one of several buckets: an image recognition system might learn the difference between different types of cars, assigning each picture a label like “sedan,” “pickup truck,” “bus,” etc. Mistakes are inevitable: consider a BRAT or El Camino. Whatever the computer decides, it’s wrong, because it didn’t have enough data on this underrepresented type of vehicle. The consequences of that particular mistake are likely to be trivial, but what if the computer is sorting through people instead of cars, and categorizing them for risk of default on a home loan? People who fall outside the common parameters are disproportionately likely to fall afoul of what the system learns are good bets from the rest of the data set — that’s just how machine learning operates. “When group membership coincides with a sensitive attribute, such as race, gender, disability, or religion, this situation can lead to unjust or prejudicial outcomes,” wrote Google Brain’s Moritz Hardt in a blog post. “Despite the need, a vetted methodology in machine learning for preventing this kind of discrimination based on sensitive attributes has been lacking.” Hardt, alongside his colleagues Eric Price and Nathan Srebro, wrote a paper describing a way to avoid this kind of outcome. There’s a lot of stuff like this: Kolmo-what now? Kolmo-what now? But the gist is this: When there’s a desired outcome and a possibility of one of those attributes incorrectly affecting someone’s likelihood of getting it, the algorithm adjusts itself so there is a similar proportion of those outcomes regardless of that attribute. It’s really no trouble for the computer — you train it so it values parity between non-relevant attributes. You can get an intuitive sense of it with these interactive charts the team made. It’s not about goosing the numbers to be politically correct; the resulting model will actually be more accurate in its predictions. And if one of these attributes is relevant — say you’re calculating the likelihood of someone having this or that religion based on their location, or making medical predictions that differ between sexes — you just include it. It’s a thoughtful line of inquiry for Google to be pursuing, and highly relevant as well, considering how machine learning is pervading so many industries so quickly.

To all the voters and volunteers who poured your hearts into this campaign: Forward!   The event was hosted by Giti and Jack Bendheim, the CEO of a company that focuses on animals for food production. https:  .  Though he still lags behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count, Sanders struck an optimistic note with his Badger State victory, and made it clear he expected to fight Clinton for delegates in her   home state of New York during its April 19 primary election. “We have now won seven out of eight of the last caucuses and we have won almost all of them with overwhelming landslide numbers,” he said. Sanders spoke from Laramie, Wyoming, where the next primary is to be held Saturday.  “With your help on Saturday, we are going to win here in Wyoming,” Sanders told the crowd shortly after being projected the winner in Wisconsin. “Please keep this a secret. Don’t tell Secretary Clinton because she’s getting a little nervous, but I think we have a chance to win New York and win a lot of delegates in that state. ” “Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet  —   he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump,” the campaign said.  Trump accused Cruz of being steered by super PACs and also illegally coordinating with them. He added the Republican establishment was behind Cruz.  Trump’s campaign added he is looking ahead to the New York primary.  “Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again,” the statement said. NEW: Trump campaign statement tonight, “Tonight is a turning point,” Cruz said during a victory speech in Milwaukee. “It is a rallying cry. ” Cruz took all of Wisconsin’s 42 delegates, closing the gap in the delegate count against Trump.  “Either before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton,” Cruz said. His victory comes as the Republican party continues to a battle from within for the nomination, but Cruz urged GOP voters to back his campaign. “We’ve got the full spectrum of the Republican Party coming together and uniting behidn this campaign. ” The victory is expected to be a particularly significant one for Cruz, who took all of the 42 delegates from Wisconsin, which is a    state for the GOP.  It is also seen as an important win for Sanders as the candidate looks to pick up momentum as the New York primary nears, a state with 291 delegates at stake and Hillary Clinton’s   home state.  With 31% of precincts reporting, Cruz was leading the Republican race with 52. 6% of the vote. Trump was in second place with 30. 6% and John Kasich with 14. 6%. On the Democratic side, Sanders was leading Clinton 53. 5 to 46. 2%. Mike Hass, the board’s spokesman, told the Associated Press that clerks across the state faced a busy pace of voters throughout the day, but no major problems were reported at the polls.  Wait times in Milwaukee, the state’s biggest city, did not exceed 30 minutes, Neil Albrecht, executive director of the Milwaukee election commission told AP. On the Republican side, more than 9 in 10 primary voters said they were very or somewhat worried with the direction of the nation’s economy, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks.  Democratic voters also cited economic concerns, with nearly   saying they were worried about the direction of the country’s economy.  The exit polls also suggest a large swath of people casting ballots Tuesday were late deciders, with about four out of 10 making up their minds in the last month. Wisconsin is expected to be a tight race for both the Democratic and Republican candidates, with nearly half of GOP voters saying they wanted someone with experience.  As to which Republican is believed to have the best shot to beat the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, more than 4 in 10 believed Cruz has the best chance. About a third said Trump has the best shot. Despite Trump’s lead in the GOP field, about four in 10 Republican voters said they were “scared” of what the Republican frontrunner would do in the White House. Only about 1 in 10 voters said they were afraid of a Kasich or Cruz presidency.  GOP voters also appeared split as to what should happen if Trump is unable to muster the needed delegates to win the nomination outright. More than half of voters in the Badger State believe the one with the most votes should get the nomination, while four in 10 would favor a contested convention. Speaking to Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, Republican Ted Cruz noted the importance of Tuesday’s election, not just for the 42 GOP delegates at stake, but for what it could mean in the party’s primary in the states ahead.  “Wisconsin has a national platform and megaphone, and if we end up with a win tonight it’s going to have national repercussions,” the Texas senator said. “I think it’s going to impact the state’s to come. ” Cruz pointed to his recent victories against delegate frontrunner Donald Trump, including his 69% popular vote victory in Utah, and called for Republican rival John Kasich to drop out of the race, saying he had “mathematically” already lost the race.  Polls have shown Cruz with a slight lead over Trump in Wisconsin, and the Manhattan billionaire made a final pitch to voters at a diner and polling station.  “We’re going to have a surprise tonight,” Trump told reporters. “I think we’re going to have a great day. I’ve worked hard in Wisconsin. ” The race could also have significant repercussions on the democratic side. NBC News reported Bernie Sanders’ campaign has outspent Hillary Clinton’s camp by nearly   . Polls show the two    in the Badger State. MIAMI  —   Let’s get this out of the way. Donald Trump is toxic with most Latino voters. A new   Times poll found that in California he has 9% favorable and 87% unfavorable ratings, the worst in a long series of historically terrible polls. Still  —   even a low percentage of Latino voters would mean a couple million Hispanic supporters. And an observer of this divisive election cycle might ask: who are these people? One answer, found in public polling, in interviews at polling places in Nevada and Florida, and in conversations with   Trump supporters on Facebook, appears to be that they’re the types of people otherwise disposed to like Donald Trump. Older men former members of the military people enraged by the power of the establishment American nationalists. Another answer reflects the diversity within the term “Latino”: Some of Trump’s supporters’ families have been American citizens for centuries, don’t know any undocumented immigrants, or don’t identify with newcomers from Mexico and elsewhere  —   all reasons that contribute to why they embrace his immigration stances. One thing they all have in common, though, is a thick skin. Read more here.  ",-1.0

"The Rubio Campaign Ends Where It Began. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. This was never how it was supposed to end for Marco Rubio, the man who once seemed ordained to save the Republican Party. Not in Florida, of all places, and certainly not at the hands of Donald Trump. ”After tonight while it is clear that we are on the right side this year, we were not on the winning side,” Rubio said. He withdrew from the presidential race on Tuesday night after finishing a distant second in the state that sent him to the Senate six years ago, and where he had been camped out for the last week in a final, frenzied bid to extend his campaign. He delivered a paean to the need for a vibrant conservative movement, built on principles, and not fear, or anger, or frustration. “I chose a different path, and I’m proud of it,” he said. He became the latest Republican establishment favorite to be bullied, belittled, and ultimately dispatched by Trump, who took home 99 delegates in    Florida. By the time Rubio spoke on Tuesday, neither the outcome nor his exit was a surprise   polling showed him losing to Trump by as much as a    margin. But much like his onetime Florida mentor, Jeb Bush, Rubio found himself baffled by a Republican primary that confounded even the most outlandish predictions. When Rubio launched his campaign 11 months ago in Miami, he was the favorite of many Republicans, but not the frontrunner. Fans and critics alike had been labeling him the GOP’s version of Barack Obama since well before Time Magazine plastered him on its cover in early 2013 under the headline, “The Republican Savior. ” It was easy to see why. A   senator in his 40s, Rubio was, like Obama, a gifted orator with a biography that embodied the American dream. He wowed Republicans with his speech at the party’s convention in 2012, and his supporters saw a strong   candidate who could easily loosen the Democrats’ tight grip on the Hispanic vote. Rubio frequently invoked his   immigrant parents, who came to the United States a few years before Fidel Castro took power in Cuba. “My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room,” Rubio said in a signature line from his announcement speech last April. Like Obama in 2008, he sought to head off questions about his youth by calling for a generational turnover, a changing of the political guard. “Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American century,” Rubio said in a line that he hoped would work both against Jeb Bush in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the fall. Yet for all of the hype, Rubio faced two major hurdles even before Trump got into the race. The first was the history of the GOP: Much more so than Democrats, Republicans have tended to nominate    candidates —  those with deep governing experience or long tenures on the national stage. In the last 50 years, the only   to win the Republican nomination who had not previously run for president was George W. Bush in 2000, and he was the son of a president and a   governor of Texas. For many Republicans, that candidate in 2016 was Jeb Bush, who moved quickly to sign up donors and staff who might otherwise have gone to Rubio. In that sense, the comparisons to Obama hurt Rubio as well. For six years, Republicans had been telling voters it was a mistake to elect a president who hadn’t even completed a single term in the Senate. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 race was that voters disgusted with Washington politics would gravitate toward a governor, a dynamic from which Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, John Kasich, or Bobby Jindal stood to benefit. The other big problem for Rubio was immigration. At a time when the Republican National Committee was formally calling for the party to embrace comprehensive reform, Rubio joined the Senate’s Gang of Eight in 2013 and tried to sell conservatives on legislation that offered an eventual path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants. The bill passed the Senate but never came up in the more conservative House, where hardliners denounced it as a form of amnesty. Rubio quickly renounced the legislation, but as the 2016 campaign began, he had lost support among conservatives who criticizing his original support for the proposal as well as from Democrats and   Republicans who said he had cut and run on a critical issue. Trump dominated both the polls and the media coverage through the summer and fall of 2015, and while he tussled with Bush, Carly Fiorina, and many of the other Republicans, Rubio flew mostly under the radar. It was a strategy that his campaign insisted was a deliberate choice, and as the Iowa caucuses rolled around, it looked like it was paying off. He fought hard with Cruz over immigration and parried attacks from Bush over his absences from the Senate, but he kept his distance —  as much as possible —  from the Trump circus. As other candidates fell away, Rubio surged into a strong   finish in Iowa, nearly eclipsing Trump. He was mocked by some for delivering a “victory speech” after coming in third, but if anyone left Iowa with a clear shot of momentum, it was Rubio. All of that disappeared, however, on a debate stage in New Hampshire. Under fire from Chris Christie for relying on canned,   soundbites, Rubio inexplicably respond with   …     the same canned soundbite. “This notion that Barack Obama doesn’t know what he’s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he’s doing,” Rubio repeated over and over again, in a performance that was immediately likened to a malfunctioning robot. Three days later, Rubio slipped to fifth place in New Hampshire, a finish that was blamed in large part on his debate debacle. He recovered in South Carolina, edging out Ted Cruz for second place in a state that seemed strong for the Texas senator. But he still could not come close to Trump, and in Nevada on February 23, the billionaire defeated Rubio by a nearly    margin. With the race narrowed to five, Rubio finally went hard against Trump. Interrupting him frequently on the debate stage in Houston, Rubio unleashed months worth of opposition research and attacked Trump over his lack of policy depth, his use of immigrant labor, the lawsuit he’s facing over Trump University, and more. Trump staggered, delivering his worst performance of the primary season. The next morning, Rubio took it even further. In a planned departure from his stump speech that seemed like a cross between a Trump impersonation and a   comedy routine, Rubio mocked the   relentlessly. He made fun of him for misspelling words in his tweets, for applying makeup to his sweaty upper lip during a commercial debate in the debate, and for possibly checking to see if he had wet his pants. Later in the weekend, Rubio made fun of Trump for having “small hands. ” “And you know what they say about guys with small hands,” Rubio said to shocked laughter from the crowd. “You can’t trust ’em!” It was funny, sure. But many Republicans didn’t seem to know whether to laugh, cheer, or cringe. It also didn’t work. Trump upstaged Rubio by announcing the surprise endorsement of Chris Christie, and he proceeded to mock the Florida senator by calling him “little Marco” at rallies and debates. On Super Tuesday, Rubio was nearly shut out, winning only the Minnesota caucuses and watching as Ted Cruz eclipsed him as Trump’s main challenger. Rubio struggled, too, in the states that followed. He exited the race having won only in Minnesota, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. By early March, Rubio had all but abandoned a national campaign and hunkered down in Florida, hoping that a victory in his   home state would keep his campaign alive and deny Trump an opportunity to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. But polls soon showed him trailing Trump badly, and the harbinger of any campaign’s demise —    operatives and preliminary obituaries by the media —  began appearing. Would Rubio drop out before Florida to save face for a future statewide run? Why did he rely so heavily on media coverage (that ultimately went to Trump) instead of investing in a better campaign organization on the ground? Rubio faces a more uncertain future than many of his Republican rivals, who can fall back on governorships, retirement, or continuing careers in Congress. In running for president, he decided not to seek reelection to the Senate, and his term will end in January. There has been speculation that he will run for governor of Florida in 2018 after Rick Scott finishes his second term. His   loss to Trump might damage his standing, but at just 44, he may yet have a long political future in a party that rewards experience and likes a good comeback story. Perhaps the most compelling, even poignant aspect of Rubio’s campaign was how much he publicly struggled to comprehend it toward the end. Barely two weeks after subjecting Trump to schoolyard taunts, Rubio told reporters he regretted doing so, that his wife and kids were embarrassed. He called Trump a “con artist,” insisted he would lose in the fall, and flirted with the #NeverTrump campaign, yet he couldn’t quite bring himself to disavow the frontrunner entirely. The campaign took a toll on him, and he could be heard coughing frequently during the final debate. At a press conference over the weekend, Rubio was pale, exhausted, and hoarse. He seemed aghast at the violence that had broken out at Trump rallies, and at the general tone of the whole campaign. “I still, at this moment, continue and intend to support the Republican nominee,” Rubio said. “But it’s getting harder every day. ” A few days later, Rubio lost to Trump again, and his bid for the presidency was over.",-0.5

"Baltic Journal, Part IV. Editor’s Note: Jay Nordlinger spent the week of September 12 in the Baltic states  —   or rather, in two of them, Latvia and Estonia. A piece of his will soon appear in National Review magazine: about the Baltics, Russia, NATO, and America, particularly in light of our presidential campaign. This journal supplements the piece, and concerns matters weighty and light. For Parts   go here, here, and here. Riga, the Latvian capital, has splendid parks.  Walking through one, I see birch trees, and think, “Russia. ”  I have associated birches with Russia  —   Pushkin and all that. In the park, there are young lovers, flirting and kissing  —   nothing grosser.  This scene is played out all over the world, immemorially.  A pleasant thing. On a bench, two young lesbians  —   punk  —   fondle each other.  “This is not your grandmother’s Riga. ” Back to my conversation with Janis Kazocins, the veteran Latvian security official (and graduate of Sandhurst, and former brigadier general in Her Majesty’s Armed Forces).  We speak of the phrase “sphere of influence. ”  It appears in the   pact.  And why should anyone follow the language and thinking of Hitler and Stalin? The thing about “spheres of influence”:  They deny, or curb,  . Kazocins says that Putin would like to create an air of inevitability.  He wants Baltic people to think that they belong with him, no matter how Western or independent they feel.  It goes like this: It’s going to happen anyway.  Have a look at the map!  It’s obvious that you’re going to be part of at least the sphere of influence of Russia.  It can’t be any other way.  The United States?  Have you heard what Trump said?  Besides, they’re going to forget about you the moment something happens in the South China Sea.  You think the Germans are going to protect you?  Yeah, right.  The Germans always wanted to split eastern Europe between themselves and Russia.  They have done it century after century, and they will do it again.  It’s inevitable.  Wouldn’t you rather do it without bloodshed?  Come on, be reasonable. As Kazocins talks, I can’t help thinking of Taiwan.  This is the sort of game that the PRC plays with Taiwan. In that conflict, or potential conflict, the United States has long had a policy of “strategic ambiguity. ”  Will we or won’t we?  If Taiwan is attacked, will the U. S. come to its aid or not?  With regard to the Baltics, the U. S. does not have a policy of strategic ambiguity.  It has NATO, and Article 5. And yet   …     who knows what would happen, in the event of a Russian attack on the Baltics?  Better not to see the question tested. And wasn’t it this way in the Cold War as well?  What if Soviet tanks had rolled into West Berlin?  What would NATO  —   what would the United States, to be blunter and more accurate  —   have done?  It is surely better that no one ever had to find out. In its propaganda, the Kremlin says that the Baltic states are basketcases.  In truth, Russia itself is a basketcase.  The economy is spiraling downward, making it ever more attractive to the Kremlin to create trouble abroad  —   so as to stir up nationalist juices at home, distracting people from their everyday problems. Dictatorial governments can be counted on to do this. But, as Kazocins points out, the effects of adventures and   abroad wear off.  In Russia, Donbass is not sexy anymore.  Even the thrill of the Crimea annexation has ebbed. So, do more?  Create more distraction?  Be ever more energetic in trying to bust up NATO? Sooner or later, a government has to attend to its own people’s needs, I suppose.  Nationalism does not fill the belly.  Although it may get a person drunk, at least for a while. Kazocins makes an arresting statement:  “The United States did not imagine that, when we joined the alliance in 2004, this would be a redline”  —   “this” being the Baltic states.  “But it is a redline. ” President Obama let one be crossed in Syria.  The Kremlin no doubt took note of that.  And it makes a difference, where NATO, including its eastern front, is concerned. Obama said that he was “very proud” of drawing back from the redline in Syria.  He told The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg this.  He had not given in to the fetish of credibility. Actually, credibility can be more than a fetish  —   it can be a sine qua non in world affairs. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  To everyone I meet in the Baltics, I ask this question, in so many words:  Why should Americans care about your security?  What is the connection between their security and yours?  Why should they do more than wish you all the best? There are many answers, of course.  The U. S. has an interest in trade  —   which is connected to U. S. prosperity.  We have an interest in stability, democracy, and the rule of law.  In not living in a world where borders can be changed by force.  In not getting dragged into another European or world war. Kazocins adds the following:  Think of the effect on U. S. foreign policy in general.  If NATO craters, or the Baltics go, think of the effect elsewhere. Japan and South Korea will see what U. S. guarantees are worth.  And then, China won’t look so bad to them, will it?  The Japanese and the South Koreans will see what terms they can get   …     And that would harm the United States  —   how?  Better not to find out (to repeat something I have already said, up above). Near the opera house, I see a monument to Alfreds Kalnins, a Latvian composer who lived from 1879 to 1951.  It seems to me I have reviewed something by Kalnins.  I can’t remember what it was.  Conducted by Neeme Järvi, the Estonian maestro? By the way, everything in Latvia is plural  —   names, I mean.  You got esses all over the place.  As in “Alfreds Kalnins. ”  They want more than one. Ojars Kalnins is no relation.  But he is an esteemed Latvian in his own right.  A member of the Saeima, the national parliament, he is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He grew up in Chicago.  So he is another one of those Latvians  —   those Balts  —   who “came back. ”  But they had never been here before, because they were born and raised abroad, in their parents’ places of refuge.  The coming back is spiritual. Ojars Kalnins lived in Chicago for more than 30 years, and he lived for 15 in Washington, D. C.  From 1993 to 2000, he was Latvia’s ambassador to the U. S. An obvious question for me to ask is, “White Sox or Cubs?”  The answer is White Sox.  Although the Cubs are the ones who are having a great year. “What was it like,” I ask, “to come to Latvia for the first time and hear the language of your home  —   your family  —   on the streets?” “I came here as a tourist in 1978, for two weeks.  I was 28 years old.  The first thing that struck me was a neon sign.  I was coming from the airport on a bus.  And there was this neon sign in Latvian, advertising milk.  I had never seen such a thing in America.  In America, the Latvian community had handwritten signs.  Not fancy, lighted signs.  So when I saw that sign saying ‘Milk,’ I thought, ‘Wow, this country is for real.’ “I had started to think my parents had made up this country.  My classmates had never heard of it.  I didn’t read about it.  Teachers made no mention of it in school.  When I saw Riga, and heard the language, I thought, ‘Okay, this is real.  If it’s not my birthplace, it’s my homeland.’ “That’s what converted me.  I became active after that.  I realized that I had a tie to this country. ” Kalnins was angry, for this reason:  He had been to other cities in Europe  —   Stockholm, for example  —   and he now thought, “Why can’t we live like these people?  If we hadn’t been invaded by the Soviets, we’d be like Stockholm or Copenhagen today, and that’s the injustice of it. ” Sitting in his office, he tells me, “I’ve been here 16 years physically, but every day when I walk the streets of Riga, I look around and I’m grateful that this is no longer Soviet Latvia. ” We’ll hear more from Mr. Kalnins in Part V, tomorrow.  Thank you, ladies and gents. ",1.0
"Pelosi: When Republicans Voted For Trump, It Was Like ’Any Mammal Will Do’ - Breitbart. Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” House Minority Leader Rep.

They were just voting a certain way. ” She continued her story, “When he said that, I said, ‘That’s not true, there is no evidence to support what you just said.’ If we were going to work together, we have to stipulate to a certain set of facts.

"Tech giants try to calm fears over artificial intelligence | TheHill. Silicon Valley powerhouses are trying to calm public fears about the rise of artificial intelligence. A new non-profit coalition that counts Google, Facebook and Amazon as members is hoping to demystify the emerging technology — one tech giants believe has the potential to transform their businesses. ""I think [it's] important to communicate to the greater public that the major providers of these technologies — and I would probably say the major investors in recent development of these technologies — care,"" said Eric Horvitz, a technical fellow and managing director at Microsoft Research who is an interim co-chair of the new effort. “They care how these technologies will influence people and [about] the social and societal consequences more broadly.” Artificial intelligence is a field that encompasses many different technological developments. It's seen in innovations like self-driving cars, helping them navigate the roads, and in the personal assistant apps on smartphones that answer queries, organize calendars and more. Observers have been predicting a coming revolution in artificial intelligence that could expand its use and its benefits to consumers. But popular culture has long stoked fears about machines taking over and wreaking havoc in films like ""The Terminator"" and ""War Games."" That has industry competitors joining forces to ease the public's concerns. The industry coalition, the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, also includes representatives from Microsoft, IBM and DeepMind, a division of Google. It says it will work to develop best practices and research that focuses on “ethics, fairness, and inclusivity” as well as privacy questions. Horvitz stressed that public education was ""secondary"" to developing and implementing best practices for people working on AI technologies. He pointed to areas like bias in machine learning, the field that involves building computer systems that can evolve without continued human programming, aswell as the relationship between human labor and artificial intelligence as areas where the industry partnership hopes to make progress. But the group has also defined its role with the public at large through its core principles. “We will educate and listen to the public and actively engage stakeholders to seek their feedback on our focus, inform them of our work, and address their questions,” the group says. Horvitz said that the group would look to broaden the discussion of artificial intelligence to better tout the benefits of the technology and dispel fears that stem from popular culture. “I think many have noted, not just the researchers, that some of the stories that have been getting attention over the last couple of the years have been stories potentially making people believe that some of the science fiction possibilities are coming our way in short order,” he said. “There’s been a sense that there’s anxiety about AI that is misplaced and that such poor understandings can lead to poor decisions when it comes to thinking through the possibilities, and in fact some of the great possibilities, for AI ahead.” There are growing questions about how artificial intelligence and machine learning will alter the economic and political worlds. A report released by Stanford University last month predicted that, in the long term, advances in artificial intelligence may result in the loss of jobs in certain areas of the economy, like trucking. The researchers cautioned, however, that in the near-term AI is likely to simply do certain tasks, rather than entire jobs, currently performed by humans. They also said the technology had the potential to create new jobs. “As a society, we are now at a crucial juncture in determining how to deploy AI-based technologies in ways that promote, not hinder, democratic values such as freedom, equality, and transparency,” the researchers said. They also considered questions related to privacy, legal liability and taxation, among others, reflecting the breadth of issues raised by the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence. For now, the Partnership on AI is taking a cautious approach. They say they won't directly lobby policymakers on issues related to artificial intelligence. But the debate over artificial intelligence and potential regulation is already brewing in Washington. Many of the companies involved in the coalition have been pressing their case individually at the White House, looking to stave off any threat of regulation. This fall the administration is expected to release a report based on a lengthy examination of the topic. Major companies and their lobbyists in Washington have weighed in as part of that process, urging that regulators not move too fast or too harshly as they think about how the technology should be governed. “The U.S. government should maintain a light-touch regulatory approach focused on consumers and outcomes over underlying technologies,” said Facebook’s James Hairston in written comments. “Any approach should consider AI's benefits to consumers and be informed by regular consultation with industry and experts — balanced with adequate consideration of security and privacy policy questions as they arise.” Michael Beckerman, who leads the Internet Association trade group, said in his comments that “while AI deployment and use is not without risk, this risk is manageable and there are demonstrable economic and non-economic benefits associated with AI.” Google also submitted comments as part of the review, as did a representative of X, the experimental projects lab under its parent company, Alphabet. The stakes are high for the Silicon Valley giants. The companies are engaging in Washington as they find that artificial intelligence technologies are a crucial growth area for their businesses — and they can be expected to keep pushing their case. Facebook recently laid out a decade-long plan that centers on just three areas: virtual and augmented reality, connectivity and artificial intelligence. Google has also staked part of its business on AI. Earlier this year, CEO Sundar Pichai announced virtual assistant and messenger products that draw on the company's AI advances. Pichai was bullish about the potential for the technology and its role in every-day life. “We believe the real test,” Pichai said, “is whether humans can achieve a lot more with machine learning assisting them.” View the discussion thread.

"Limbaugh insists he never took Trump seriously on deportation plan  | TheHill. Rush Limbaugh insisted during his radio show on Monday that he never took Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s deportation proposal seriously.  An angry caller slammed Limbaugh for downplaying the Republican presidential nominee’s shifting stance on immigration, according to the Washington Examiner.  Trump repeatedly called out his primary rivals for opposing deportations of all illegal immigrants, the caller said.  “I mean, John Kasich ... laughingly said, “Come on, folks, this isn’t serious. He’s not gonna deport everyone,’” the caller told Limbaugh. “And Trump went ahead and ridiculed everybody who wasn’t for deportation.”  “For you to sit here and say now that he adopts all the positions of everybody he ridiculed as not even being a flip-flop and it’s no big deal? This is why so many Republican voters have such a hard time going to the con man!” the caller continued.  “This is going to enrage you,” Limbaugh responded. “You know, I could choose a path here to mollify you, but — I never took [Trump] seriously on this.”  “But 10 million people did,” the caller said.  “Yeah, and they still don’t care!” Limbaugh said. “My point is, they still don’t care! They’re going to stick with him no matter what.”  After meeting with Hispanic leaders earlier this month, Trump suggested he may back away from his position on deporting an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. But later in the week, he said he'd start deporting illegal immigrants with a criminal background in his first hour in office.  He will be giving a major immigration speech in Arizona on Wednesday.  View the discussion thread.

"Pregnant Women Are The ’Forgotten Victims’ Of War. Let’s say a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure. In ordinary circumstances, her medical team will monitor her condition. If there’s a threat to the fetus, the doctor might want to bring on labor early. In the end, mother and baby are usually fine. But what if she’s living in a war zone? First of all, she might not know she has the condition. Sometimes a pregnant woman with high blood pressure shows no symptoms. And amid the chaos of combat, regular checkups may be hard to arrange. Even if she is aware of complications, like swelling of the hands, feet and face, she still might not be able to get to a hospital equipped with blood pressure cuffs and doctors with the right expertise. ”Nobody wants to drive through the streets because it is too dangerous,” says Dr. Andrew Weeks, an obstetrician and expert on maternal deaths who published a chilling editorial about the risks of war for pregnant women in the journal The BMJ. ”There are no taxis. There’s no money. So you start walking or being carried to the nearest health facility, which is in ruins. Of course you’re going to die. You haven’t got a chance.” And it’s not just a lack of medical care, he says. Direct attacks on pregnant women are another concern. In his editorial, Weeks described women being shot while giving birth in Nigeria and a fetus being shot through a pregnant woman’s belly by a sniper in Syria. Without any official tracking of the number of pregnant women who die from reasons related to war, these women often become ”forgotten victims,” says Weeks. ”Every avenue you look at for women during war times, their health is compromised,” says Weeks, a professor at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. ”The voices of women in war situations are often neglected. These are the lost voices we’re trying to highlight.” Collecting accurate data is rarely a priority or even a possibility during war. Overall, an estimated 303, 000 pregnant women die around the world each year. Above that, nobody knows exactly how many of the 140, 000 or so women who die in conflict each year are pregnant, though estimates are sobering. In general, 4 percent of the population in any emergency setting will be pregnant, says Janet Meyers, deputy director for health policy and practice at International Medical Corps, a   organization that provides health care in global emergencies. And more than a third of maternal deaths happen in crisis settings. Rates are highest in South Sudan, where more than 2, 000 women die for every 100, 000 live births. In the United States, deaths occur in about 14 of every 100, 000 births. In the midst of active combat, drug supplies often dwindle. Doctors and midwives may flee. Even clean, running water can be hard to come by. And those are just the secondary problems. As social systems break down, violence and sexual violence against women rise. Because pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time  —   when even ordinary complications can quickly become tragic  —   Weeks hopes that his editorial will bring more attention to protecting pregnant women who are stuck in terrible situations. There may be some cause for hope, Meyers says, including some    efforts by health providers to care for pregnant women in war zones. Awareness is also growing that reproductive health services need to be part of crisis response plans. In South Sudan, for example, the International Medical Corps is training midwives and placing them in rural communities. ”One of the most important things we can do is make sure women have access to deliveries by skilled birth attendants and access to emergency obstetric and newborn care,” Meyers says. ”You cannot predict who will have a complication.” Equally important, she says, is giving women a choice to not get pregnant in the first place. ”I really can’t emphasize enough that we need to make family planning available,” she says. ”I’ve had women say to me, ’I do not want to get pregnant in this situation.’ ”",-0.5
"Communities Uneasy As Utilities Look For Places To Store Coal Ash. Outside Susan Holmes’ house in southeastern Oklahoma, visitors are welcomed by an entryway lined with oxygen bottles and a machine that collects and concentrates oxygen from the air. ”I take two inhalers twice a day,” Holmes says. ”And I have a nebulizer that I use four times a day, and I use oxygen at night.” She says her asthma returned when she moved to Bokoshe, a decaying town of about 500 people that is flanked by old coal mines. The huge pits have now been filled with hundreds of thousands of tons of coal ash. About 130 million tons of coal ash are produced every year. Power companies used to keep it in big, open holes called coal ash ponds. No lining was required to stop leakage, and no monitoring, to even know if it was leaking. Then, in 2008, a ruptured dike spilled more than a billion gallons of coal ash slurry from a pond operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency considered classifying coal ash as ”hazardous waste.” The utility industry lobbied hard  —   and successfully  —   to avoid the hazardous waste designation. So in 2014, EPA’s new rules said coal ash was not hazardous. Now, power companies must recycle the ash, store it more securely on site, or send the ash to landfills. But in the towns where that ash is ending up, nobody is quite happy with those options. Blowin’ in the wind, The ash in Bokoshe comes from a   power plant down the road  —   up to 180 truckloads a day. Holmes says the powdery ash is no match for the Oklahoma wind. ”When it blows, it’s like this huge cloud of dust,” she says. ”It gets on everything. If you were to go out and feel my car, the top of it feels like sandpaper.” Currently, there is little medical evidence for some residents’ claims that coal ash has contributed to health problems. But the federal government recently funded a   study exploring the issue. In 2014, 16 million tons of coal ash were used for what’s known as minefill, and the numbers keep rising. It’s now the main way the industry recycles the fossil fuel waste.   is considered a beneficial use for coal ash  —   and a success story for the industry. The Department of Interior oversees the practice and has yet to regulate it. ”That’s certainly, I think, preferable than to just having these materials pile up in landfills,” says Tom Adams of the American Coal Ash Association. ”At the end of the day, if it creates a better situation when the mine is filled, I think you gotta consider that a benefit.” Not in my landfill, One such landfill is just outside Jesup, a town in southeast Georgia. ”If you want to store it somewhere, put it in the safest spot possible, which is what we do,” says Ken Valihora, general manager of the Broadhurst Environmental Landfill. The landfill has two layers of liners and monitoring wells, and it meets all EPA standards for handling coal ash. As with about 2, 000 other landfills across the country, there’s no permit and no public process required before it can start bringing in coal ash. And the owners would like to bring in a lot of it. ”The permit was sized to assume we could take a full train a day,” says David Remick, operations manager at the landfill. ”About 90 to 100 cars. That maximum amount would be about 10, 000 tons of waste.” That’s 10, 000 tons of coal ash per day. Frank Holleman, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, says his preferred option is to see coal ash safely stored at the power plants. Georgia Power, which is the biggest utility in the state, is doing that at about half of its plants. But if a landfill can show that it’ll securely store coal ash, Holleman says that’s better than where it is now. ”Get it out of these dangerous, unlined pits,” Holleman says. ”Put it in safe dry lined storage, away from the waterways.” But the plan for the Jesup landfill is not going over well with locals. Wayne County Commissioner Ralph Hickox doesn’t like the idea of trains bringing in waste from out of state. ”I don’t want to become the nation’s dump,” Hickox says. ”We didn’t create the coal ash here I don’t want the coal ash here.” This is not just a ”   ” issue, says Peggy Riggins, a retired high school   . Riggins, who has been recruiting locals to her organization No Ash At All, says she’s also concerned about the effect the coal ash could have on streams and a nearby river. Sure, she agrees that how coal ash has previously been stored is an issue. ”But you don’t fix a problem by creating another problem,” Riggins says. ’From the top down’ The waste management industry, however, sees itself as a part of the solution. ”We do have to reassure the public that we, as waste management people, know how to run landfills,” says Anne Germain of the National Waste and Recycling Association. In Bokoshe, Okla. officials say the pit operator is complying with pollution rules, though it has received multiple regulatory reprimands and corrective orders over the years. Still, residents like Dub Tolbert maintain the community is left exposed. He says he’s determined to make regulators listen. ”It starts from the top down,” Tolbert says, speaking at an American Legion post with a group of townspeople. ”Our governor, our congressmen  —   all of them. They protect that.” Opponents of the Jesup landfill are hiring lawyers and reviewing the county’s contract with the landfill, but there’s not actually much they can do. There are some signs that government officials are getting more concerned about coal ash. The Oklahoma State Department of Health recently pledged to investigate cancer rates in Bokoshe. And the Department of Interior says it is writing a new rule on minefilling, to be released by the end of the year. That will set up a whole new fight over coal waste regulations. ”We’re not going to sit over here and let that stuff blow all over the country without telling somebody about it,” Tolbert says. ”We’re going to aggravate somebody.” Joe Wertz, of StateImpact Oklahoma, worked with the Center for Public Integrity to report this story.

"Backs To Betsy DeVos; Scholarships Denied; Paul Ryan Visits A Charter School   . Hello and welcome to another edition of NPR Ed’s weekly national education news roundup! DeVos heckled at   University, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ first commencement address since taking office was interrupted by persistent boos when she addressed graduates at a private, Christian, historically black university in Florida. About half the graduates turned their backs on the secretary in protest. At one point the school’s president, Edison O. Jackson, warned students he’d mail them their diplomas if the jeering continued. That led to only a brief pause. DeVos has made missteps when it comes to historically black colleges, as we reported: ”Earlier this year, DeVos called HBCUs ’real pioneers when it comes to school choice,’ a remark she was forced to walk back after protests in fact, these colleges were founded as the only option for students when other colleges were still legally segregated. Just this week, DeVos found herself clarifying comments by President Trump that seemed to suggest that a key form of funding for HBCUs might be unconstitutional.” The protests also included a large petition drive, open letters and calls on President Jackson to resign. Some of the loudest jeers during the speech came when DeVos said she’d be visiting the gravesite of the university’s founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, a daughter of former slaves and a civil rights leader. ”It’s a complete insult,” alumna Trinice McNally told NPR Ed. ”There is no comparison to my founder.” Paul Ryan visits a charter school, House Speaker Paul Ryan also faced protesters this week when visiting a charter school in Harlem for National Teacher Appreciation Day. The school is part of a charter network, Success Academy, in New York City known for its high test scores and   leader, Eva Moskowitz. She was once rumored to be under consideration for President Trump’s education secretary. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, also met briefly with a special education class in a public school that shares the building, Newsday reported. A few dozen protesters, including one wearing a Trump costume per this video, greeted Ryan. Their chants primarily referred to the Affordable Care Act repeal that passed the House last week. The Medicaid cuts in that bill would directly affect services for special education students. State education plans ready for review, Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have submitted complete state education plans, the Education Department announced. You can see the list here. The plans outline how states will comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including establishing student growth targets, helping underperforming schools and consulting with stakeholders to finalize plans. The plans are headed for peer review there is a second deadline for more states to submit in September. Update on   students denied grants for formatting errors, As we covered a few weeks ago, the Department of Education in March denied grant applications from dozens of colleges and universities, totaling $10 million, because of small formatting errors like neglecting to  . The money, from a federal program called Upward Bound, helps   students prepare for college. In a memo released this week, Secretary DeVos declared that going forward, page limits and formatting standards could no longer be used to reject such applications. However, the Associated Press reported that the rejected applications will not be revisited. It’s five years until the next round, meaning some of these programs may have to shut down in the interim. A tax tool to make college aid applications easier is down until the fall  The IRS Data Retrieval Tool won’t be usable until October, an Education Department official has testified.  The tool was designed to allow college aid applicants filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, to add their family tax information with the push of a button. It was taken down because of security concerns just prior to many state deadlines, in March. Accurate info is crucial for determining how much college help students qualify for. Without it, applicants have to fill in their tax return data manually, which takes longer and is prone to error. At the beginning of this month, most   applicants to traditional colleges had to lock down their decisions, including FAFSA applications. Returning students and those at colleges with rolling admissions may still be filling out the form. On Oct. 1, it becomes available for the   school year, hopefully with the Data Retrieval Tool restored. DeVos won’t speak at education writers’ conference, Betsy DeVos will not be addressing the upcoming   national meeting of the Education Writers Association, as is traditional for education secretaries. The largest annual gathering of journalists who cover education takes place in Washington, D. C. at the end of this month. A spokesman for DeVos told NPR Ed, ”unfortunately, her schedule is full and she’s unavailable this year.”",-0.5
"How technology disrupted the truth. One Monday morning last September, Britain woke to a depraved news story. The prime minister, David Cameron, had committed an “obscene act with a dead pig’s head” according to the Daily Mail. “A distinguished Oxford contemporary claims Cameron once took part in an outrageous initiation ceremony at a Piers Gaveston event, involving a dead pig,” the paper reported. Piers Gaveston is the name of a riotous Oxford university dining society the authors of the story claimed their source was an MP, who said he had seen photographic evidence: “His extraordinary suggestion is that the future PM inserted a private part of his anatomy into the animal. ” The story, extracted from a new biography of Cameron, sparked an immediate furore. It was gross, it was a great opportunity to humiliate an elitist prime minister, and many felt it rang true for a former member of the notorious Bullingdon Club. Within minutes, #Piggate and #Hameron were trending on Twitter, and even senior politicians joined the fun: Nicola Sturgeon said the allegations had “entertained the whole country” while Paddy Ashdown joked that Cameron was “hogging the headlines”. At first, the BBC refused to mention the allegations, and 10 Downing Street said it would not “dignify” the story with a response  —   but soon it was forced to issue a denial. And so a powerful man was sexually shamed, in a way that had nothing to do with his divisive politics, and in a way he could never really respond to. But who cares? He could take it. Then, after a full day of online merriment, something shocking happened. Isabel Oakeshott, the Daily Mail journalist who had   the biography with Lord Ashcroft, a billionaire businessman, went on TV and admitted that she did not know whether her huge, scandalous scoop was even true. Pressed to provide evidence for the sensational claim, Oakeshott admitted she had none. “We couldn’t get to the bottom of that source’s allegations,” she said on Channel 4 News. “So we merely reported the account that the source gave us   …     We don’t say whether we believe it to be true. ” In other words, there was no evidence that the prime minister of the United Kingdom had once “inserted a private part of his anatomy” into the mouth of a dead pig  —   a story reported in dozens of newspapers and repeated in millions of tweets and Facebook updates, which many people presumably still believe to be true today. Oakeshott went even further to absolve herself of any journalistic responsibility: “It’s up to other people to decide whether they give it any credibility or not,” she concluded. This was not, of course, the first time that outlandish claims were published on the basis of flimsy evidence, but this was an unusually brazen defence. It seemed that journalists were no longer required to believe their own stories to be true, nor, apparently, did they need to provide evidence. Instead it was up to the reader  —   who does not even know the identity of the source  —   to make up their own mind. But based on what? Gut instinct, intuition, mood? Does the truth matter any more? Nine months after Britain woke up giggling at Cameron’s hypothetical porcine intimacies, the country arose on the morning of 24 June to the very real sight of the prime minister standing outside Downing Street at 8am, announcing his own resignation. “The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected,” Cameron declared. “It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision. So there can be no doubt about the result. ” But what soon became clear was that almost everything was still in doubt. At the end of a campaign that dominated the news for months, it was suddenly obvious that the winning side had no plan for how or when the UK would leave the EU  —   while the deceptive claims that carried the leave campaign to victory suddenly crumbled. At 6. 31am on Friday 24 June, just over an hour after the result of the EU referendum had become clear, Ukip leader Nigel Farage conceded that a   UK would not in fact have £350m a week spare to spend on the NHS  —   a key claim of Brexiteers that was even emblazoned on the Vote Leave campaign bus. A few hours later, the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan stated that immigration was not likely to be reduced  —   another key claim. It was hardly the first time that politicians had failed to deliver what they promised, but it might have been the first time they admitted on the morning after victory that the promises had been false all along. This was the first major vote in the era of   politics: the listless remain campaign attempted to fight fantasy with facts, but quickly found that the currency of fact had been badly debased. The remain side’s worrying facts and worried experts were dismissed as “Project Fear”  —   and quickly neutralised by opposing “facts”: if 99 experts said the economy would crash and one disagreed, the BBC told us that each side had a different view of the situation. (This is a disastrous mistake that ends up obscuring truth, and echoes how some report climate change.) Michael Gove declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts” on Sky News. He also compared 10 Nobel   economists who signed an   letter to Nazi scientists loyal to Hitler. For months, the Eurosceptic press trumpeted every dubious claim and rubbished every expert warning, filling the front pages with too many confected   headlines to count  —   many of them later quietly corrected in very small print. A week before the vote  —   on the same day Nigel Farage unveiled his inflammatory “Breaking Point” poster, and the Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned tirelessly for refugees, was shot dead  —   the cover of the Daily Mail featured a picture of migrants in the back of a lorry entering the UK, with the headline “We are from Europe  —   let us in!” The next day, the Mail and the Sun, which also carried the story, were forced to admit that the stowaways were actually from Iraq and Kuwait. The brazen disregard for facts did not stop after the referendum: just this weekend, the   Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom, fresh from a starring role in the leave campaign, demonstrated the waning power of evidence. After telling the Times that being a mother would make her a better PM than her rival Theresa May, she cried “gutter journalism!” and accused the newspaper of misrepresenting her remarks  —   even though she said exactly that, clearly and definitively and on tape. Leadsom is a   politician even about her own truths. When a fact begins to resemble whatever you feel is true, it becomes very difficult for anyone to tell the difference between facts that are true and “facts” that are not. The leave campaign was well aware of this  —   and took full advantage, safe in the knowledge that the Advertising Standards Authority has no power to police political claims. A few days after the vote, Arron Banks, Ukip’s largest donor and the main funder of the Leave. EU campaign, told the Guardian that his side knew all along that facts would not win the day. “It was taking an   media approach,” said Banks. “What they said early on was ‘Facts don’t work’ and that’s it. The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the Trump success. ” It was little surprise that some people were shocked after the result to discover that Brexit might have serious consequences and few of the promised benefits. When “facts don’t work” and voters don’t trust the media, everyone believes in their own “truth”  —   and the results, as we have just seen, can be devastating. How did we end up here? And how do we fix it?   years after the first website went online, it is clear that we are living through a period of dizzying transition. For 500 years after Gutenberg, the dominant form of information was the printed page: knowledge was primarily delivered in a fixed format, one that encouraged readers to believe in stable and settled truths. Now, we are caught in a series of confusing battles between opposing forces: between truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, kindness and cruelty between the few and the many, the connected and the alienated between the open platform of the web as its architects envisioned it and the gated enclosures of Facebook and other social networks between an informed public and a misguided mob. What is common to these struggles  —   and what makes their resolution an urgent matter  —   is that they all involve the diminishing status of truth. This does not mean that there are no truths. It simply means, as this year has made very clear, that we cannot agree on what those truths are, and when there is no consensus about the truth and no way to achieve it, chaos soon follows. Increasingly, what counts as a fact is merely a view that someone feels to be true  —   and technology has made it very easy for these “facts” to circulate with a speed and reach that was unimaginable in the Gutenberg era (or even a decade ago). A dubious story about Cameron and a pig appears in a tabloid one morning, and by noon, it has flown around the world on social media and turned up in trusted news sources everywhere. This may seem like a small matter, but its consequences are enormous. “The Truth” as Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote in Stick It Up Your Punter! their history of the Sun newspaper, is a “bald statement which every newspaper prints at its peril”. There are usually several conflicting truths on any given subject, but in the era of the printing press, words on a page nailed things down, whether they turned out to be true or not. The information felt like the truth, at least until the next day brought another update or a correction, and we all shared a common set of facts. This settled “truth” was usually handed down from above: an established truth, often fixed in place by an establishment. This arrangement was not without flaws: too much of the press often exhibited a bias towards the status quo and a deference to authority, and it was prohibitively difficult for ordinary people to challenge the power of the press. Now, people distrust much of what is presented as fact  —   particularly if the facts in question are uncomfortable, or out of sync with their own views  —   and while some of that distrust is misplaced, some of it is not. In the digital age, it is easier than ever to publish false information, which is quickly shared and taken to be true  —   as we often see in emergency situations, when news is breaking in real time. To pick one example among many, during the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, rumours quickly spread on social media that the Louvre and Pompidou Centre had been hit, and that François Hollande had suffered a stroke. Trusted news organisations are needed to debunk such tall tales. Sometimes rumours like these spread out of panic, sometimes out of malice, and sometimes deliberate manipulation, in which a corporation or regime pays people to convey their message. Whatever the motive, falsehoods and facts now spread the same way, through what academics call an “information cascade”. As the legal scholar and   expert Danielle Citron describes it, “people forward on what others think, even if the information is false, misleading or incomplete, because they think they have learned something valuable. ” This cycle repeats itself, and before you know it, the cascade has unstoppable momentum. You share a friend’s post on Facebook, perhaps to show kinship or agreement or that you’re “in the know” and thus you increase the visibility of their post to others. Algorithms such as the one that powers Facebook’s news feed are designed to give us more of what they think we want  —   which means that the version of the world we encounter every day in our own personal stream has been invisibly curated to reinforce our   beliefs. When Eli Pariser, the   of Upworthy, coined the term “filter bubble” in 2011, he was talking about how the personalised web  —   and in particular Google’s personalised search function, which means that no two people’s Google searches are the same  —   means that we are less likely to be exposed to information that challenges us or broadens our worldview, and less likely to encounter facts that disprove false information that others have shared. Pariser’s plea, at the time, was that those running social media platforms should ensure that “their algorithms prioritise countervailing views and news that’s important, not just the stuff that’s most popular or most  ”. But in less than five years, thanks to the incredible power of a few social platforms, the filter bubble that Pariser described has become much more extreme. On the day after the EU referendum, in a Facebook post, the British internet activist and mySociety founder, Tom Steinberg, provided a vivid illustration of the power of the filter bubble  —   and the serious civic consequences for a world where information flows largely through social networks: I am actively searching through Facebook for people celebrating the Brexit leave victory, but the filter bubble is SO strong, and extends SO far into things like Facebook’s custom search that I can’t find anyone who is happy *despite the fact that over half the country is clearly jubilant today* and despite the fact that I’m *actively* looking to hear what they are saying. This   problem is now SO severe and SO chronic that I can only beg any friends I have who actually work for Facebook and other major social media and technology to urgently tell their leaders that to not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies   …     We’re getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other. But asking technology companies to “do something” about the filter bubble presumes that this is a problem that can be easily fixed  —   rather than one baked into the very idea of social networks that are designed to give you what you and your friends want to see. Facebook, which launched only in 2004, now has 1. 6bn users worldwide. It has become the dominant way for people to find news on the internet  —   and in fact it is dominant in ways that would have been impossible to imagine in the newspaper era. As Emily Bell has written: “Social media hasn’t just swallowed journalism, it has swallowed everything. It has swallowed political campaigns, banking systems, personal histories, the leisure industry, retail, even government and security. ” Bell, the director of the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  —   and a board member of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian  —   has outlined the seismic impact of social media for journalism. “Our news ecosystem has changed more dramatically in the past five years,” she wrote in March, “than perhaps at any time in the past 500. ” The future of publishing is being put into the “hands of the few, who now control the destiny of the many”. News publishers have lost control over the distribution of their journalism, which for many readers is now “filtered through algorithms and platforms which are opaque and unpredictable”. This means that social media companies have become overwhelmingly powerful in determining what we read  —   and enormously profitable from the monetisation of other people’s work. As Bell notes: “There is a far greater concentration of power in this respect than there has ever been in the past. ” Publications curated by editors have in many cases been replaced by a stream of information chosen by friends, contacts and family, processed by secret algorithms. The old idea of a   web  —   where hyperlinks from site to site created a   and decentralised network of information  —   has been largely supplanted by platforms designed to maximise your time within their walls, some of which (such as Instagram and Snapchat) do not allow outward links at all. Many people, in fact, especially teenagers, now spend more and more of their time on closed chat apps, which allow users to create groups to share messages privately  —   perhaps because young people, who are most likely to have faced harassment online, are seeking more carefully protected social spaces. But the closed space of a chat app is an even more restrictive silo than the walled garden of Facebook or other social networks. As the pioneering Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, who was imprisoned in Tehran for six years for his online activity, wrote in the Guardian earlier this year, the “diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned” has given way to “the centralisation of information” inside a select few social networks  —   and the end result is “making us all less powerful in relation to government and corporations”. Of course, Facebook does not decide what you read  —   at least not in the traditional sense of making decisions  —   and nor does it dictate what news organisations produce. But when one platform becomes the dominant source for accessing information, news organisations will often tailor their own work to the demands of this new medium. (The most visible evidence of Facebook’s influence on journalism is the panic that accompanies any change in the news feed algorithm that threatens to reduce the page views sent to publishers.) In the last few years, many news organisations have steered themselves away from   journalism and toward   news, chasing page views in the vain hope of attracting clicks and advertising (or investment)  —   but like junk food, you hate yourself when you’ve gorged on it. The most extreme manifestation of this phenomenon has been the creation of fake news farms, which attract traffic with false reports that are designed to look like real news, and are therefore widely shared on social networks. But the same principle applies to news that is misleading or sensationally dishonest, even if it wasn’t created to deceive: the new measure of value for too many news organisations is virality rather than truth or quality. Of course, journalists have got things wrong in the past  —   either by mistake or prejudice or sometimes by intent. (Freddie Starr probably didn’t eat a hamster.) So it would be a mistake to think this is a new phenomenon of the digital age. But what is new and significant is that today, rumours and lies are read just as widely as   facts  —   and often more widely, because they are wilder than reality and more exciting to share. The cynicism of this approach was expressed most nakedly by Neetzan Zimmerman, formerly employed by Gawker as a specialist in   viral stories. “Nowadays it’s not important if a story’s real,” he said in 2014. “The only thing that really matters is whether people click on it. ” Facts, he suggested, are over they are a relic from the age of the printing press, when readers had no choice. He continued: “If a person is not sharing a news story, it is, at its core, not news. ” The increasing prevalence of this approach suggests that we are in the midst of a fundamental change in the values of journalism  —   a consumerist shift. Instead of strengthening social bonds, or creating an informed public, or the idea of news as a civic good, a democratic necessity, it creates gangs, which spread instant falsehoods that fit their views, reinforcing each other’s beliefs, driving each other deeper into shared opinions, rather than established facts. But the trouble is that the business model of most digital news organisations is based around clicks. News media around the world has reached a   of frenzied   in order to scrape up digital advertising’s pennies and cents. (And there’s not much advertising to be got: in the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in the US on online advertising went to Google and Facebook. That used to go to news publishers.) In the news feed on your phone, all stories look the same  —   whether they come from a credible source or not. And, increasingly,   sources are also publishing false, misleading, or deliberately outrageous stories. “Clickbait is king, so newsrooms will uncritically print some of the worst stuff out there, which lends legitimacy to bullshit,” said Brooke Binkowski, an editor at the debunking website Snopes, in an interview with the Guardian in April. “Not all newsrooms are like this, but a lot of them are. ” We should be careful not to dismiss anything with an appealing digital headline as clickbait  —   appealing headlines are a good thing, if they lead the reader to quality journalism, both serious and not. My belief is that what distinguishes good journalism from poor journalism is labour: the journalism that people value the most is that for which they can tell someone has put in a lot of work  —   where they can feel the effort that has been expended on their behalf, over tasks big or small, important or entertaining. It is the reverse of   “churnalism” the endless recycling of other people’s stories for clicks. The digital advertising model doesn’t currently discriminate between true or not true, just big or small. As the American political reporter Dave Weigel wrote in the wake of a hoax story that became a viral hit all the way back in 2013: “‘Too good to check’ used to be a warning to newspaper editors not to jump on bullshit stories. Now it’s a business model. ” A   industry desperately chasing down every cheap click doesn’t sound like an industry in a position of strength, and indeed, news publishing as a business is in trouble. The shift to digital publishing has been a thrilling development for journalism  —   as I said in my 2013 AN Smith lecture at the University of Melbourne, “The Rise of the Reader” it has induced “a fundamental redrawing of journalists’ relationship with our audience, how we think about our readers, our perception of our role in society, our status”. It has meant we have found new ways to get stories  —   from our audience, from data, from social media. It has given us new ways to tell stories  —   with interactive technologies and now with virtual reality. It has given us new ways to distribute our journalism, to find new readers in surprising places and it has given us new ways to engage with our audiences, opening ourselves up to challenge and debate. But while the possibilities for journalism have been strengthened by the digital developments of the last few years, the business model is under grave threat, because no matter how many clicks you get, it will never be enough. And if you charge readers to access your journalism you have a big challenge to persuade the digital consumer who is used to getting information for free to part with their cash. News publishers everywhere are seeing profits and revenue drop dramatically. If you want a stark illustration of the new realities of digital media, consider the   financial results announced by the New York Times and Facebook within a week of one another earlier this year. The New York Times announced that its operating profits had fallen by 13% to $51. 5m  —   healthier than most of the rest of the publishing industry, but quite a drop. Facebook, meanwhile, revealed that its net income had tripled in the same period  —   to a quite staggering $1. 51bn. Many journalists have lost their jobs in the past decade. The number of journalists in the UK shrank by up to   between 2001 and 2010 US newsrooms declined by a similar amount between 2006 and 2013. In Australia, there was a 20% cut in the journalistic workforce between 2012 and 2014 alone. Earlier this year, at the Guardian we announced that we would need to lose 100 journalistic positions. In March, the Independent ceased existing as a print newspaper. Since 2005, according to research by Press Gazette, the number of local newspapers in the UK has fallen by 181  —   again, not because of a problem with journalism, but because of a problem with funding it. But journalists losing their jobs is not simply a problem for journalists: it has a damaging impact on the entire culture. As the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas warned, back in 2007: “When reorganisation and   in this core area jeopardise accustomed journalistic standards, it hits at the very heart of the political public sphere. Because, without the flow of information gained through extensive research, and without the stimulation of arguments based on an expertise that doesn’t come cheap, public communication loses its discursive vitality. The public media would then cease to resist populist tendencies, and could no longer fulfil the function it should in the context of a democratic constitutional state. ” Perhaps, then, the focus of the news industry needs to turn to commercial innovation: how to rescue the funding of journalism, which is what is under threat. Journalism has seen dramatic innovation in the last two digital decades, but business models have not. In the words of my colleague Mary Hamilton, the Guardian’s executive editor for audience: “We’ve transformed everything about our journalism and not enough about our businesses. ” The impact on journalism of the crisis in the business model is that, in chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity, news organisations undermine the very reason they exist: to find things out and tell readers the truth  —   to report, report, report. Many newsrooms are in danger of losing what matters most about journalism: the valuable, civic,          hard graft of uncovering things that someone doesn’t want you to know. Serious,   journalism is demanding, and there is more of a need for it than ever. It helps keep the powerful honest it helps people make sense of the world and their place in it. Facts and reliable information are essential for the functioning of democracy  —   and the digital era has made that even more obvious. But we must not allow the chaos of the present to cast the past in a rosy light  —   as can be seen from the recent resolution to a tragedy that became one of the darkest moments in the history of British journalism. At the end of April, a    inquest ruled that the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 had been unlawfully killed and had not contributed to the dangerous situation at the football ground. The verdict was the culmination of an indefatigable    by the victims’ families, whose case was reported for two decades with great detail and sensitivity by Guardian journalist David Conn. His journalism helped uncover the real truth about what happened at Hillsborough, and the subsequent   by the police  —   a classic example of a reporter holding the powerful to account on behalf of the less powerful. What the families had been campaigning against for nearly three decades was a lie put into circulation by the Sun. The tabloid’s aggressive rightwing editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, blamed the fans for the disaster, suggesting they had forced their way into the ground without tickets  —   a claim later revealed to be false. According to Horrie and Chippindale’s history of The Sun, MacKenzie overruled his own reporter and put the words “THE TRUTH” on the front page, alleging that Liverpool fans were drunk, that they picked the pockets of victims, that they punched, kicked and urinated on police officers, that they shouted that they wanted sex with a dead female victim. The fans, said a “  police officer” were “acting like animals”. The story, as Chippindale and Horrie write, is a “classic smear” free of any attributable evidence and “precisely fitting MacKenzie’s formula by publicising the   ignorant prejudice being voiced all over the country”. It is hard to imagine that Hillsborough could happen now: if 96 people were crushed to death in front of 53, 000 smartphones, with photographs and eyewitness accounts all posted to social media, would it have taken so long for the truth to come out? Today, the police  —   or Kelvin MacKenzie  —   would not have been able to lie so blatantly and for so long. The truth is a struggle. It takes hard graft. But the struggle is worth it: traditional news values are important and they matter and they are worth defending. The digital revolution has meant that journalists  —   rightly, in my view  —   are more accountable to their audience. And as the Hillsborough story shows, the old media were certainly capable of perpetrating appalling falsehoods, which could take years to unravel. Some of the old hierarchies have been decisively undermined, which has led to a more open debate and a more substantial challenge to the old elites whose interests often dominated the media. But the age of relentless and instant information  —   and uncertain truths  —   can be overwhelming. We careen from outrage to outrage, but forget each one very quickly: it’s doomsday every afternoon. At the same time, the levelling of the information landscape has unleashed new torrents of racism and sexism and new means of shaming and harassment, suggesting a world in which the loudest and crudest arguments will prevail. It is an atmosphere that has proved particularly hostile to women and people of colour, revealing that the inequalities of the physical world are reproduced all too easily in online spaces. The Guardian is not immune  —   which is why one of my first initiatives as    was to launch the Web We Want project, in order to combat a general culture of online abuse and ask how we as an institution can foster better and more civil conversations on the web. Above all, the challenge for journalism today is not simply technological innovation or the creation of new business models. It is to establish what role journalistic organisations still play in a public discourse that has become impossibly fragmented and radically destabilised. The stunning political developments of the past year  —   including the vote for Brexit and the emergence of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency  —   are not simply the byproducts of a resurgent populism or the revolt of those left behind by global capitalism. As the academic Zeynep Tufekci argued in an essay earlier this year, the rise of Trump “is actually a symptom of the mass media’s growing weakness, especially in controlling the limits of what it is acceptable to say”. (A similar case could be made for the Brexit campaign.) “For decades, journalists at major media organisations acted as gatekeepers who passed judgment on what ideas could be publicly discussed, and what was considered too radical,” Tufekci wrote. The weakening of these gatekeepers is both positive and negative there are opportunities and there are dangers. As we can see from the past, the old gatekeepers were also capable of great harm, and they were often imperious in refusing space to arguments they deemed outside the mainstream political consensus. But without some form of consensus, it is hard for any truth to take hold. The decline of the gatekeepers has given Trump space to raise formerly taboo subjects, such as the cost of a global   regime that benefits corporations rather than workers, an issue that American elites and much of the media had long dismissed  —   as well as, more obviously, allowing his outrageous lies to flourish. When the prevailing mood is   and   trust in big institutions, including the media, begins to crumble. I believe that a strong journalistic culture is worth fighting for. So is a business model that serves and rewards media organisations that put the search for truth at the heart of everything  —   building an informed, active public that scrutinises the powerful, not an   reactionary gang that attacks the vulnerable. Traditional news values must be embraced and celebrated: reporting, verifying, gathering together eyewitness statements, making a serious attempt to discover what really happened. We are privileged to live in an era when we can use many new technologies  —   and the help of our audience  —   to do that. But we must also grapple with the issues underpinning digital culture, and realise that the shift from print to digital media was never just about technology. We must also address the new power dynamics that these changes have created. Technology and media do not exist in isolation  —   they help shape society, just as they are shaped by it in turn. That means engaging with people as civic actors, citizens, equals. It is about holding power to account, fighting for a public space, and taking responsibility for creating the kind of world we want to live in.

"Fake rice seized in Nigeria, but what is it?. Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigerian authorities have seized 2. 5 metric tons of reportedly fake rice during the holiday season. On Tuesday, the Nigerian Custom Service said it intercepted 102 bags of a brand called Best Tomato Rice after the recipient of a gift of rice alerted authorities. The health ministry released a statement on Friday urging Nigerians to remain calm after preliminary findings found no evidence that the rice was plastic or consisted of toxic chemical substances. Yet, the country’s National Agency for Food Drug Administration Control has not released their investigative report. The health minister’s statement contradicts earlier reports from customs officials.  Mamudu Haruna, comptroller of the Federal Operations Unit, called it ”plastic” rice at a press briefing in Lagos Thursday. ”We have done the preliminary analysis on the plastic rice. After boiling, it was sticky and only God knows what would have happened if people consumed it.” Haruna described the importers of the fake rice as ”economy saboteurs” seeking to capitalize off of Nigerians looking for bargains during the Christmas and New Year holiday season. It is unclear where the shipment of rice originated. ”A consultant said he was given 221 bags to distribute,” Jerry Attah, the public relations officer for the assistant superintendent of customs, told CNN.  One customer who avoided a potential mishap was Kikelomo Adediti. She said she bought 10 cups of the product (about 2 kg) from a small retailer in the Ikeja area of Lagos, in November. ”It looked perfectly normal and cost less [than regular rice] so I thought I got a great deal. Normally it would take about 20 minutes [to cook] but after 30 minutes it was still hard. I added more water and the aroma was chemical in nature so I decided to discard it thinking it had expired,” she told CNN. Adediti didn’t formally report the incident. In another case, a woman who received rice as a gift noticed something was wrong after cooking it. Her husband then called customs officials.  Plastic, resin or none of the above, Yet, it’s still unclear what the rice is made of.  ”If you look at it it’s rice. If you look at the pictures it’s rice. If you cook it and eat it it’s rice. It’s only when you touch it you’ll feel it that you realize it’s not,”  Attah told CNN. ”That’s why I call it fake rice, not plastic rice. To me it’s more like flour coated in maybe rubber. .. I don’t know the kind of formulations or chemicals they use,” he said. Attah said that a total of 221 bags    each weighing 25 kilos    came into Nigeria, but only 102 were recovered, which means 119 have already been distributed.  Nigerians’ love for rice, Rice is a major staple food in Nigeria and a favorite holiday meal, often prepared as jollof rice.  It is estimated that Nigerians consume 6 million metric tons of rice per year in 2013, former minister of agriculture, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said the country spends more than $1 billion annually to import rice. ”Though rice contribute a significant proportion of the food requirements of the [Nigerian] population, production capacity is far below the national requirements. In order to meet the increasing demand,  Nigeria has had to resort to importation of milled rice to bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply,” according to Professor Tunji Akande, author of An overview of the Nigerian Rice Economy. Forex woes, With imports adversely affected by the country’s foreign exchange woes and the continued rise of the dollar against Nigeria’s currency the Naira, the cost of rice has more than doubled.  Bags of rice were on sale for NGN22, 000 in Bodija market Ibadan and other major Nigerian markets on Thursday, compared with about NGN10, 000 a year ago. The desire for cheaper rice makes Nigerians vulnerable to counterfeit foods industry: ”Rice is very expensive and people are looking for where to get it at cheaper rates. If a regular bag costs NGN17, 000 but the plastic one is being sold for 9, 000, many Nigerian families will buy it,” said economics expert Lanre Adigun. ”This is further aided by the porous nature of Nigeria’s borders. Since the Nigerian government had already banned rice importation into the country through the land borders, the commodity is still being smuggled into the country through the border with Benin Republic. You can go to any market and you will see all sorts of rice imported through the land borders,” said Feyikemi Oladokun, a nutrition expert who works with the agriculture ministry in Kwara state.  Not just Nigeria, In 2011, a Korean news report revealed some fake rice is produced from potatoes that are shaped as rice with the addition of industrial resin. Even when cooked, the report said the rice remained hard.  Dr. Victoria Feyikemi of Babcock University Hospital Ogun state, Nigeria, said the medical consequences of consuming such products can be severe because the fake rice has synthetic resin that is harmful to the body. ”When you eat three bowls of this rice, you are basically ingesting one vinyl bag and the toxicity and associated pathologies are numerous. We cannot afford to add plastic   medical emergencies to our numerous health challenges in Nigeria, remember we are still struggling with Lassa fever,” she said.",-1.0
"Better safe than sorry or #Snowperbole?. New York (CNN) It’s the ”crippling and potentially historic” blizzard that turned out to be neither. ”They were trying to   each other,” architect Rebecca Uss in New York City said Tuesday, speaking of officials in the region who had warned of the coming snowstorm. ”In hindsight, it was overkill,” said Brian Beirne, who was sledding with his son Micah on New York’s Upper West Side. ”It’s much ado about nothing.” Roberto Gonzalez slept in the lobby of a building, curling up near a radiator, since the restaurant he worked at closed too late Monday for him to get on the subway to go home. ”When I woke up, I expected the end of the world. I went outside and nothing (had) happened. What storm?” Some people in the Northeast are concerned the government cried wolf. ”They decided to close,” a woman named Anesah, who works with international students in Philadelphia, tweeted about her workplace.  There ”isn’t a flurry to be found. I don’t think they’ll ever give us off again. #crywolf.” ”This #snowFail does not bode well for civilian cooperation with the terms of the next snow emergency in NYC,” Lisa B. in New York said on Twitter. Government officials say the measures taken, including travel bans, are helpful for the quick cleanup of streets and, most importantly, are signs of erring on the side of caution. ”Better safe than sorry,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had warned Monday that the storm could be one of the largest ”in the history of this city.”  Instead, ”It’s going to be a fast return to normalcy,” de Blasio said. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was asked at a news conference Tuesday about suggestions that the predictions were ”overblown.”  ”That would be an oversimplification,” he said, laughing.  The eastern part of the state was heaviest hit and is still receiving ”significant and continued snowfall,” he said. Still, despite previous warnings that people might be without power for days, ”By and large we’ll be back to normal for most of our state tomorrow,” Malloy said. Many people had stocked up on days’ worth of necessities and prepared to hunker down for what the National Weather Service said could be a ”raging blizzard.”   Some are now calling it all ”snowperbole.” But Liz Childs, who works at a hospital in New York, said she doesn’t believe authorities overreacted. ”I feel we were lucky this time,” she said. ”I think we dodged a bullet.” Sights and sounds of the blizzard, Some meteorologists apologize, Some who forecast the weather professionally felt the need to apologize, including Gary Szatkowski, with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. ”My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public,” he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ”You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn’t.  Once again, I’m sorry.”   He wasn’t alone. An online collection showed several similar tweets from meteorologists, including one from News 12 New Jersey’s Dave Curren saying the forecast ”deflated as much as New England Patriots footballs.” Many of the responses to these posts were supportive. ”You are making a prediction about the future. Closing roads at 11 p. m. when it snows saves lives,” Jennifer Smith in New York wrote to Szatkowski.  ”No apology necessary.” Government officials face a tough dilemma. They don’t want to shut everything down, keeping children home from school and people home from work, but they also do not want to risk a disaster. ”Look at what happened in Atlanta when the city wasn’t prepared,” Frank Flores said in a Facebook discussion.   He was referring to an incident a year ago this week in which people were stranded along miles and miles of icy interstates, paralyzing the metro area for more than 24 hours. Many ultimately abandoned their cars and walked home. Why the forecasts were wrong, and what they got right  There’s some   over the forecasting models used.  Here’s the basic idea, from CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller: ”Meteorologists largely depend on three major forecast models:  the NAM (North American Mesoscale) the GFS (Global Forecast System) and the ECMWF (European Center for Medium Range Forecasting).  Meteorologists will look at all of these and, using their own expertise, local knowledge, etc. formulate a forecast.  In this case, the NAM and the ECMWF both showed 2 feet of snow or more for New York City, while the GFS (which has just been upgraded this winter) showed a more conservative 6 to 12 inches. ”The National Weather Service forecasters in New York certainly went all in with the NAM and ECMWF forecasts, and all but ignored the GFS, without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the GFS showing a vastly different solution.”  (In 2012, the ECMWF ”was the   model for properly forecasting Superstorm Sandy to a ’t’ while the GFS did not,” Miller says.  ”Now it is the opposite. ”) Still, ”the forecast wasn’t too far off if you look at it as a whole,” Miller says. ”The heaviest snow fell across much of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Long Island and Massachusetts.  Winds have gusted up to hurricane strength, which was also in the forecast.” Predicted storm surge flooding also came to fruition, he said. ”But of course the headlines are going to come from New York City and New Jersey, where a forecast of more than 2 feet turned out to only be about half that,” Miller said. There were 2 feet of snow elsewhere, and ”a miss of only 30 to 40 miles in a forecast that was first given 48 hours in advance is not that bad from a strictly forecasting perspective.” But from a ”practical perspective,” it’s a ”big miss, and has major ramifications with business disruption, wasted resources and tax dollars, etc. ,” Miller said. CNN did note the discrepancy among forecasts Monday, even as government officials were announcing closures. ”I just got the brand new models in just a minute ago. And one model says for New York City 2 inches    not 2 feet, 2 inches. The other model I looked at said 27 inches,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers noted. ”I hate it when models don’t agree to that extent.” It’s not an exact science, and it’s important for people to know that, Miller says. ”As meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts.” Opinion: Weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain",-1.0
"Student Loan Forgiveness Program Approval Letters May Be Invalid, Education Dept. Says - The New York Times. More than 550, 000 people have signed up for a federal program that promises to repay their remaining student loans after they work 10 years in a public service job. But now, some of those workers are left to wonder if the government will hold up its end of the bargain  —   or leave them stuck with thousands of dollars in debt that they thought would be eliminated. In a legal filing submitted last week, the Education Department suggested that borrowers could not rely on the program’s administrator to say accurately whether they qualify for debt forgiveness. The thousands of approval letters that have been sent by the administrator, FedLoan Servicing, are not binding and can be rescinded at any time, the agency said. The filing adds to questions and concerns about the program just as the first potential beneficiaries reach the end of their   commitment  —   and the clocks start ticking on the remainder of their debts. Four borrowers and the American Bar Association have filed a suit in United States District Court in Washington against the department. The plaintiffs held jobs that they initially were told qualified them for debt forgiveness, only to later have that decision reversed  —   with no evident way to appeal, they say. The suit seeks to have their eligibility for the forgiveness program restored. “It’s been really perplexing,” said Jamie Rudert, one of the plaintiffs. “I’ve never gotten a straight answer or an explanation from FedLoan about what happened, and the Department of Education isn’t willing to provide any information. ” The forgiveness program offers major benefits for borrowers, advocates say, to the point of persuading some people to take public service jobs instead of more lucrative work in the private sector. The program generally covers people with federal student loans who work for 10 years at a government or nonprofit organization, a diverse group that includes public school employees, museum workers, doctors at public hospitals and firefighters. The federal government approved the program in 2007 in a sweeping, bipartisan bill. About 25 percent of the nation’s work force may qualify for the program, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated. Eligibility is based on a borrower’s employer and whether it meets the program’s rules, not on the specific work an applicant does. On its website, the Education Department directs borrowers who believe their employer qualifies to submit a certification form to FedLoan. If the form is approved, the Education Department transfers the borrower’s loans to FedLoan, which collects payments and tracks the borrower’s progress toward the 120 qualifying monthly payments they must make before the remaining balances will be forgiven. Only a small fraction of the millions of workers who might qualify for the program have begun the process of using it. Fewer than 553, 000 borrowers have submitted at least one certification form to FedLoan and received its approval, according to Education Department data. Borrowers are encouraged to submit a new certification form each year. But some of those approved borrowers might get bad news because it is unclear whether the certifications are valid. Mr. Rudert submitted the certification form in 2012 and received a letter from FedLoan affirming that his work as a lawyer at Vietnam Veterans of America, a nonprofit aid group, qualified him for the forgiveness program. But in 2016, after submitting his latest annual recertification note to FedLoan, he got a denial note. The decision was retroactive, he was told. None of his previous work for the group would be considered valid for the loan forgiveness program. What changed? Mr. Rudert said he did not know. After filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he received a reply from FedLoan saying that his application “had initially been approved in error. ” He has not been told what the error was, and has not found any way to appeal the decision. Mr. Rudert and the American Bar Association filed their suit in December, alleging that the Education Department acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in making its decisions about which employers qualified. Last week, the department filed a reply that said that FedLoan’s responses to borrowers’ certification forms cannot be trusted. A FedLoan approval letter “does not reflect a final agency action on the borrower’s qualifications” for the forgiveness program, the department wrote. The idea that approvals can be reversed at any time, with no explanation, is chilling for borrowers. Mr. Rudert, who graduated from law school owing nearly $135, 000 on student loans, said he would have picked a different employer if he had known that his work at Vietnam Veterans of America would not qualify. A FedLoan spokesman would not comment on the case, referring questions to the Department of Education. A department spokesman also declined to comment on the suit or on any of the issues it raised, including whether any mechanism exists for borrowers to challenge a denial. That lack of transparency has been a hallmark of the forgiveness program, said Natalia Abrams, the executive director of Student Debt Crisis, an advocacy group. The program’s rules are complex. Only certain types of federal loans qualify, meaning that many borrowers need to restructure their debt to make it eligible  —   and the Education Department has done little to clarify gray areas, Ms. Abrams said. No borrowers’ debts have been eliminated. Because 10 years of service are required, the first wave of qualified workers will be eligible to submit applications for debt forgiveness in October. At that point, others whose certifications were approved by FedLoan could discover that the Education Department has a different position. Some employers clearly qualify  —   the definition of a “government organization” is fairly straightforward  —   but the rules for certain nonprofit organizations are harder to interpret. “It’s kind of a no man’s land,” Ms. Abrams said. “We don’t know how this will pan out. ” Linda Klein, president of the American Bar Association, called the department’s response “illogical, untenable and bewildering. ” An unreliable certification system “exposes those undertaking public service work  —   exactly what Congress intended them to do  —   to crippling financial risk,” she said. Mr. Rudert left Vietnam Veterans of America in 2015 and now works at Paralyzed Veterans of America, helping former service members appeal denied applications for disability benefits. The work is almost identical to what he did in his former job, Mr. Rudert said. Last year, FedLoan approved his certification request and deemed Paralyzed Veterans of America a qualified employer.",-1.0
"Pence unlikely to open donor floodgates to Trump. Washington (CNN) Mike Pence brings connections and appeal to a   of the Republican Party’s wealthiest financiers to the ticket with Donald Trump, but he nevertheless is unlikely going to convert those into big dollars for the fall campaign, according to interviews with donors and operatives deeply tied to   networks. The Indiana governor is unique in the breadth of his donor connections. He has long held ties to Charles and David Koch, whose associates have saluted him as one of the best governors in the country. And Pence also pleases less ideological donors allied with groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable    two organizations that have publicly opposed Trump’s trade policies. Even if Pence offers Trump something of an entrée to the GOP elite, there is a worry that he would be tarnished by his connection to a Republican presidential candidate who is unpopular in his on party, some supportive Republicans said. But the battery of Republican organizations and conservative donors that have chosen to snub Trump and spend their money elsewhere    particularly to help the GOP hold the Senate    signaled that they had no plans to change course, even while maintaining that their admiration for the Indiana governor remains strong. ”Our efforts will remain focused on the Senate,” said a Koch spokesman, James Davis. The Ricketts family, which financed much of the   advertising barrage during the primary, includes a fellow Midwestern governor    Nebraska’s Pete Ricketts    who has praised Pence’s ”steady, strategic leadership.”  Pence, however, has not inspired them to change their position and donate to the Republican ticket, according to a source close to the Ricketts family. The same is true for Paul Singer, a New York   worth $2 billion who had been supporting Pence, according to a Republican source. Pence does have strong allies who could decide to help the   ticket. Associates of Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who were working behind the scenes to convince Trump to choose former House Speaker Newt Gingrich instead, said Thursday they could live with the choice. ”We like Pence,” one said.  The   Republican Jewish Coalition is expected to rally to Pence, who authored a bill in Congress to construct a security fence in Israel. Pence was   when he addressed RJC members in Las Vegas two years ago, and those ties could help him win over   Jewish donors. Signs emerged Thursday from two particular constellations of donors were bullish on  : The   Club for Growth, which is helmed by David McIntosh, a close Pence ally from Indiana, said that after spending millions of dollars against Trump in the GOP primary that he had picked a ”great VP.” Spokesman Doug Sachtleben predicted their donors may now be more likely to back the ticket. Another network weighing how much trust to put in Pence: Crossroads, a constellation of super PACs and nonprofits founded by Karl Rove and today allied with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Crossroads, after spending tens of millions to back Mitt Romney in 2012, has assiduously stayed on the sidelines in 2016, directing its donors and dollars toward Senate races but    unlike the Koch network    always leaving the door open to spending in the presidential race should the dynamics change. Crossroads will once again consider spending in the presidential if the Pence pick ends up exciting its donors, according to a group official. But at least one major supporter, Jay Bergman of Illinois, said he believed Pence would change the equation of the   leadership. Praising Pence as someone who ”could probably pass for an accountant somewhere,” Bergman said Crossroads donors would be drawn to his   style in contrast to Trump’s ”outrageous” comments. ”At this point, I’m supporting Donald Trump to an extent, but if Mike Pence is his running mate, I will probably support him a lot more,” said Bergman, who met with Trump in a small group at a Chicago fundraiser this week. ”I would contribute more than I otherwise would.” And despite early indications from the Kochs that their   opposition to Trump had not budged an inch, some Republicans are putting faith in Pence’s ability to comb his Rolodex in Koch world, which gathers later this month for a highly anticipated summit. ”He actually has an opening and credibility to slowly work them to consider supporting the ticket,” said Austin Barbour, a Republican fundraiser. ”If he chose someone who doesn’t have that relationship, that would be awfully hard to convince them to jump in.” Pence’s political and financial ties to Koch world are extensive. A close outside adviser, Marc Short, until this spring oversaw all Koch spending. Pence’s deputy chief of staff, Matt Lloyd, is a former executive at Koch Industries. And several of his top donors in his governor’s races are reportedly aligned with the sprawling financial network, including Fred Klipsch, Pence’s campaign treasurer. Yet Pence does form a contrast with the party’s other leading fundraisers in one major way: He’s a social conservative courting a donor class that largely is not too concerned with culture wars. That’s left donors and operatives who are more aligned with the GOP’s Wall Street wing unenthused, predicting that Pence will do more to win     activists than the   business set. ”I’m not enamored with him,” said one top fundraiser, who bundled checks for Marco Rubio during the primary campaign. ”I liked the previous governor a hell of a lot more.”",-1.0
"Astronauts Back Home After A Year In Space. American astronaut Scott Kelly is back on Earth, ending his extended stay on the International Space Station. Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, who both spent most of the past year in space, landed at 11:26 p. m. ET in Kazakhstan. Cosmonaut Sergei Volkov, who arrived on the ISS last September, also returned with Kelly and Kornienko. Kelly was lifted from the capsule and placed in a seat to allow his body to readjust to the earth’s gravity. Shortly after that, he and his Russian crew mates were taken to a tent and subjected to a range of tests of their vision, balance, strength and dexterity. The tests are in part designed to see how quickly a crew traveling to Mars might be able to begin work after landing on the Red Planet. Kelly will next travel back to Houston, Texas. After a series of additional medical tests, he says he’s headed to his pool for a swim. Our earlier post: Here’s a fun fact about   space flight: There’s no shower on board the International Space Station. ”It’s kind of like I’ve been in the woods camping for a year,” astronaut Scott Kelly said during a news conference late last week. Kelly finally gets to come home and wash off the space funk on Tuesday night. He climbed into a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and closed the hatch around 4:40 p. m. ET. His capsule undocked at 8:02 p. m. and he’ll touch down just before 11:30 p. m. on the chilly steppes of Kazakhstan. While in orbit, Kelly posted hundreds of photos, and we’ve got a selection here. Kelly’s 340 days in orbit shatters the U. S. record for the longest space journey. Only a handful of cosmonauts have logged more consecutive days in space. Researchers are using the mission, which Kelly conducted with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, to learn more about how prolonged spaceflight affects the body and mind. The study is unique partly because Kelly has an identical twin: retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who stayed back on Earth. Studying the Kelly brothers’ DNA may provide some hints about how spaceflight changes human genetics, says John Charles, the chief scientist of NASA’s human research program.",-0.5
"Donald Trump’s Intolerance for Intolerance.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In Mario Cuomo’s famous phrase, leaders campaign in poetry and govern in prose. But as Donald Trump is finding, sometimes the gap is larger still —  more like translating across languages. Take one of Trump’s central policy planks since last fall: excluding people who might pose a risk of terrorism from entering the United States. The Republican nominee has run through a range of different versions of the policy, working to transform an idea that resonated strongly with his voters during the Republican primary into a workable proposal —  so far, with minimal success. His latest swing, proposing an unusual ideological test, is part of a   speech Trump delivered in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday. Trump first announced he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the United States in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting. Initially, it appeared that the proposal could encompass barring even American citizens who are Muslim and traveling abroad from reentering the country. The campaign eventually scaled that back to involve apparently only   and   residents. That proposal was widely decried as unworkable —  it would overwhelm the immigration system, officials said, and besides, couldn’t respondents simply lie about their religion? —  and likely unconstitutional because of its religious test in any case, it seemed to violate American principles. In a later iteration, therefore, Trump said he would ban immigration from countries with a track record of terrorism. Trump more or less admitted this was a sham: “People were so upset when I used the word ‘Muslim.’ ‘Oh, you can’t use the word “Muslim. ”’ Remember this. And I’m OK with that, because I’m talking territory instead of Muslim. ” The switch circumvented the religious test, but raised other problems. For example, would it prevent immigration of people from Britain, France, or Belgium, countries that have grappled with a series of terrorist attacks? Trump was vague. At one point, he said that Muslims from Britain would be acceptable. Meanwhile, the   idea created other problems. The plight of Christians in the Middle East, who have been persecuted by ISIS,    groups, and others, is a popular cause with Christians in the United States, particularly the conservative ones who form an important part of the Republican base. The plight of Jews in Muslim countries is also a treasured cause. That created a bind for Trump’s running mate Mike Pence, as my colleague Emma Green reported. Pence needed to defend Trump’s policy without appearing to be abandoning persecuted Christians. A Pence spokesman later said that he would support the creation of “safe havens” where Christians and Jews could be protected while being vetted. The idea of safe havens for refugees is not new, but it has proven tricky to implement. It is either extremely costly and logistically challenging, or else it tends toward failure and tragedy, as occurred with inadequately protected UN “safe areas” in Bosnia during the 1990s. Trump’s latest idea is to focus on individuals themselves. The AP reports that those seeking to enter the U. S. would be queried on their stances on issues like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights: “Through questionnaires, searching social media, interviewing friends and family or other means, applicants would be vetted to see whether they support American values like tolerance and pluralism. ” He was somewhat more vague in the speech itself: In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes towards our country or its principles —  or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country. Only those who we expect to flourish in our country —  and to embrace a tolerant American society —  should be issued visas. It’s an interesting approach, not least in the items Trump’s advisers have named as criteria. Trump has struggled to support religious freedom, not least with his initial Muslim immigration proposal. He has struggled with tolerance more broadly, for example offering a highly dubious definition of free speech and calling for stricter libel laws. Trump might be in the position of demanding that those seeking to immigrate to or seek refuge in the United States uphold values that he himself seems ambivalent about. The focus on tolerance points to one of the great paradoxes of immigration in liberal democracies. By insisting that immigrants follow certain, particular values, Trump is aligned with the   right in Europe, a constellation of populist political parties that have lobbied against “multicultural” conceptions of society. Their supporters argue that there is a tension between values: On the one hand, societies in Western Europe and the U. S. have tended to view welcoming beleaguered immigrants in as a moral imperative. But what happens if Enlightenment values of tolerance and democracy produce an influx of people who are not committed to those values, and who irreversibly change the body politic to eventually undermine them? For these groups, and for Trump, certain measures of intolerance are vital for ensuring tolerance. Their opponents contend that to say so is to step down a slippery slope. Ideological tests for admission to the country are not new. As far back as the Alien and Sedition Acts in John Adams’s presidency, U. S. policymakers have sought to restrict who can and cannot enter the country, remain in the country, or become a citizen. In 1903, Congress banned anarchists from entering the United States after a worldwide outbreak of anarchist violence. Currently, anyone wishing to become a citizen or a permanent resident is asked whether he or she is or has ever been a member of the Communist Party, a totalitarian party, the Nazi Party, or a terrorist organization. Applicants for asylum are asked whether they have been members of political parties, guerrilla groups, or paramilitary organizations. These questions are somewhat straightforward: They exclude people based on whether they are members of groups that seek the overthrow of the U. S. government and political system. Trump’s suggestion is murkier, and goes beyond a simple exclusionary test. For example, plenty of Americans oppose gay rights and even gender equality, and while it isn’t hard to find progressives willing to label those views “” they are also constitutionally protected views for citizens and residents, and within mainstream discourse. An ideological test such as this presents two major risks of manipulation, one each by the asker and the answerer. From the government side, an ideological test can quickly be turned to questionable purposes, and interpretations can vary widely. For example, many Republican regard the argument that women are underpaid for the same work as men as a canard. Would agreeing with them get a prospective immigrant blacklisted? From the other side, wouldn’t it be relatively simple for an applicant to simply lie? What unites all these caveats is a question of the extent to which Trump truly understands the current system for refugee intake. In Maine earlier this month, he warned that refugees to the United States are coming from the “most dangerous places,” an almost comical point: The very essence of a refugee is that she is coming from a place of danger. Refugees by definition do not come from stable, tolerant, liberal democracies. Trump has also claimed, falsely or at the very least with great hyperbole, that there is “no system to vet” refugees from the Middle East. At other moments, he has simply said the system is bad: “There’s no way to properly vet these people, so what they do is make up paperwork. ” There is a system in place, and it is exceedingly rare for refugees (and those who have been granted asylum in the U. S.) to commit acts of terrorism. The State Department told Fox News that about 12 out of 785, 000 refugees admitted to the U. S. since 1975 have been deported or arrested thanks to security concerns that existed before they entered the U. S. Another minuscule fraction has become involved in terror later. But doubters say that it only takes one or two successful terrorists to produce carnage, and some critics, including my colleague David Frum, have deemed the system fraught. What would Trump do to rectify the problem? His system of questionnaires, interviews, and background checks sounds broadly similar to the current system, which involved interviewing applicants, combing for worrisome connections, and checking their names against intelligence files. The inclusion of social media is somewhat fresher. The revelation, following the San Bernardino attacks, that U. S. screeners were not searching for applicants on social networks infuriated many conservatives. But that, too, has already changed, with the Department of Homeland Security scrambling to include those networks in their process. Taken in sum, Trump’s ideas seem to have evolved from a   but arguably illegal process in the first place to a proposal that now largely resembles the status quo, although with a few additional, vague tests. What Trump calls “extreme vetting” looks quite a bit like the existing vetting, only with an adjective attached. If the past is any indication, however, Monday’s proposal may prove to be just another rough draft as well. Translation is an inexact and imperfect art.",-0.5
"Google Fi now officially supports most Android devices and iPhones – TechCrunch. Google is making a major move to expand the availability of its Fi wireless service. It’s been a few years since Google launched Project Fi with the promise of doing things a bit differently than the large carriers. Because it could switch between the cell networks of multiple providers to give you the best signal, the service only ever officially supported a select number of handsets. You could always trick it by activating the service on a supported phone and then moving your SIM card to another (including an iPhone), but that was never supported. That’s changing today, though. The company is opening up Fi — and renaming it to Google Fi — and officially expanding device support to most popular Android phones, as well as iPhones. Supported Android phones include devices from Samsung, LG, Motorola and OnePlus. iPhone support is currently in beta, and there are a few extra steps to set it up, but the Fi iOS app should now be available in the App Store. One thing you might not get with many of the now-supported phones is the full Fi experience, with network switching and access to Google’s enhanced network features, including Google’s VPN network. For that, you’ll still need a Pixel phone, the Moto G6 or any other device that you can buy directly in the Fi store. Fi on all phones comes with the usual features, like bill protection, free high-speed international roaming and support for group plans. To sweeten the deal, Google is also launching a somewhat extraordinary promotion today: If you open a new Fi account — or if are an existing user — you can buy any phone in the Fi shop today and get your money back in the form of a travel gift card that you can use for a flight with Delta or Southwest, or lodging with Airbnb and Hotels.com. There’s some fine print, of course (you need to keep your account active for a few months, etc.), but if you were looking at getting Fi anyway, like to travel and want to get a Pixel 3 XL, that’s not a bad deal at all. The fine print is below: Travel on Fi with Any Device Purchase Promotion Terms (Google Fi) Limited time, 24-hour offer applies to any qualifying device purchased from fi.google.com from 11/28/18 12:00 AM PT through 11/28/18 11:59 PM PT, or while supplies last. When you purchase a qualifying device on fi.google.com, you can redeem a travel gift card in the amount you paid for the device, excluding taxes (details below). To qualify for this promotion, a device must be activated within 15 days of device shipment and remain active for 60 consecutive days within 75 days of device shipment. The device must be activated within the same plan that was used to purchase the device. Activation must be for full service (i.e., activation does not apply to a data-only SIM). This offer is available for new Google Fi customers as of 11/28/18 12:00 AM PT and existing, active Google Fi customers. If the customer is new to Google Fi, the customer must transfer (port-in) their current personal number over to Google Fi during sign up. The number being transferred must be currently active and have been active with the previous carrier and the customer since 8/28/18 12:00 AM PT. After the terms have been satisfied, the customer will receive an email from Google Fi (around 75 – 90 days after device activation) with instructions on how to obtain a gift card from Tango subject to Tango’s terms and conditions. The user can redeem gift card amounts with select travel partners: Airbnb, Delta Airlines, Hotels.com, and Southwest Airlines. Gift cards may also be subject to the terms of the travel partners. If Fi service is paused for more than 7 days or cancelled within 120 days of activation, the value of the gift card will be charged to your Google Payments account to match the purchased price of the device. Limit one per person. This offer is only available for U.S. residents ages 18 and older, and requires Google Payments and Google Fi accounts. Unless otherwise stated, this offer cannot be combined with other offers. Offer and gift card redemption are not transferable, and are not valid for cash or cash equivalent.

" This Is What It’s Actually Like To Live In A Surveillance State.  Petra Epperlein had forgotten what she was doing on October 7, 1989, but the photograph showed it plain as day. “I almost fainted,” she said, as she looked at the picture, watchful and taken from a distance, of herself in her twenties and her father among a crowd of observers looking at the protest below. The image had been taken by the secret police in the final days of the East German dictatorship, as part of their notoriously invasive mass surveillance program. Epperlein stumbled upon the photo while investigating a family secret: Shortly after the Berlin Wall came down and Germany was reunified, her father received anonymous letters accusing him of being an informant for the Ministry of State Security, or Stasi. After her father committed suicide in 1999, Epperlein wanted to know if the accusation was true, and if it contributed to her father’s decision to kill himself. The investigation is the subject of a new documentary, Karl Marx City. The film takes its name from the city where Epperlein was born. Back when Germany was divided in two and the German Democratic Republic in the east was ruled by a communist dictatorship, Karl Marx City was an industrial center of the   ‘dictatorship of the proletariat.’ After reunification, the city returned to its   name, Chemnitz, and most signs of the communist regime were erased. “There is no continuity in the life of East Germans,” said Epperlein. “When Germany talks about its history, the East German part plays a very, very tiny part” in the official narrative. Karl Marx City follows Epperlein’s effort to uncover the truth about her family and to understand a world that has literally been erased from the map. Surveillance was “the essential element of life,” Epperlein told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “Everybody had a good childhood. I had loving parents and friends,” but she was careful to draw a distinction. “My personal experience is disconnected from the harshness of what went on. ” The documentary explores this paradox through the Stasi’s own surveillance footage. At face value, the images are unremarkable, almost boring  —   men, women, and children going about their    existence. But they reveal obsessive and pervasive spying. “You always had a feeling it existed, but you never really knew what was going on,” said Epperlein, recalling her childhood. It was this uncertainty that gave the Stasi their power. The question of how many people worked for the Stasi is still unclear. An employee at the Stasi archive told BuzzFeed News that “there is no simple answer. ” However, documents show that by 1988 there were tens of thousands of Stasi employees and nearly 200, 000 documented informants. That amounts to roughly one spy per 60 citizens, and research suggests that the numbers were much higher, with many more undocumented “information providers” who spied on their coworkers, classmates, neighbors, or friends. You could never be sure if you were speaking in confidence, and for decades it effectively silenced political discussion. If you had something to say, “you would go for a long walk in the woods,” said Epperlein, now in her 50s. Stasi oppression was “very sophisticated,” pointed out Michael Tucker, Epperlein’s   and husband. “It’s not necessarily the oppression of violence, it’s so subtle, it’s so in everything. ” Epperlein agreed. For her, “One thing that surveillance achieved back then and achieves now is it erodes trust. ” In the film, Epperlein’s mother Christa discusses the possibility that her husband had been an informant and says, “I’m a little afraid  …    If you learn that someone who you trusted did something. That’s difficult. That’s why I always thought, rather not know. ” The specter of pervasive surveillance opened up even the most intimate relationships to suspicion. While Christa hid from dark questions about her husband, Epperlein distrusted her father. “Everything is possible and you never know what was really going on,” she recalled. “We were kids and you never really know your parents. I was pretty much ready for everything. ” The product of that surveillance is now archived and available to the public through records requests. There have been more than 7 million such inquiries since 1991. Out of the shadows and subject to careful oversight, the records are oddly quaint  —   analog and organized by an extensive card catalog. On microfiche, one of the archivists observes in the film, the images of envelopes intercepted and opened by the Stasi look like miniature houses. The records are so extensive, however, that the materials, including photographs, video and audio recordings, and 41 million index cards would stretch 68 miles, roughly equivalent to the width of New Jersey. “One of the interesting things is how much of the information they collected was complete nonsense,” Tucker observed. “There’s a certain madness in it. How much can you collect before it’s ridiculous?” It took four years for Epperlein to receive her father’s records. Ultimately, the records show that Epperlein’s father was not an informant. In fact, the file reveals the Stasi had regarded his political views as suspicious and that his boss had reported on his activities, along with details about the family life. “This is bitter,” Epperlein’s mother says in the film. It’s “an invasion of privacy at a level I did not expect,” Epperlein said in the interview. While the file doesn’t answer the question of why Epperlein’s father decided to kill himself, knowing that he was not an informant has given the family closure. When Epperlein finds the picture of the protest in the film, the narrator observes that Stasi surveillance shows her father as the man she always knew him to be. “It kept a record of my life for me,” she told BuzzFeed News. Of course, she also pointed out, “it comes back to trust. ” In the   since the Wall came down, it has become commonplace for many people to share intimate details of their lives on social media. Reflecting on our current environment, Tucker said, “We don’t have any barriers on privacy anymore, we all want attention, that’s how we get our status. ” “People trust their information not to be used against them,” said Epperlein. “Is it justified to be that trusting? I don’t know, I’m not on Facebook. ”  ",-1.0
"Political strategist Bradley Tusk on his fast rise in Silicon Valley – TechCrunch. Bradley Tusk has long been known in political circles. He was once deputy governor of Illinois, working for the now-incarcerated former governor Rod Blagojevich. He also worked for Michael Bloomberg during one of his tenures as mayor of New York City and in 2009 ran Bloomberg’s successful, third re-election campaign. In fact, thanks to a generous bonus check from Bloomberg, Tusk was able to start a consultancy in 2010 that helps Fortune 500 companies launch political-style campaigns to achieve a particular end. A year later, in another stroke of luck, Tusk became the first outside consultant to Uber and accepted his pay in equity. Since then, through a separate outfit that only accepts its payment in equity,  Tusk has become a go-to source both Silicon Valley VCs and startup founders needing help in persuading regulators to let them have their way. (Among its other 22 clients: Eaze, AltSchool, Lemonade, and Handy.) At a StrictlyVC event last week, Tusk talked about his work in Silicon Valley, whether he is interested (as sometimes rumored) in running for office himself, and what certain startups can expect from the Trump administration. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity; you can watch the broader interview below. TC: Why go into business for yourself after the Bloomberg campaign? BT: I knew that the skill set that I had was really devising and running campaigns, and because my work had taken me all over the country, I knew I could do it in lots of places. And those two things were a little different from what anyone else in that market was doing. And Mike is a generous man, and he gave me a bonus at the end of the campaign, and I took a look at the amount left after taxes – it was all the money I had — and I looked at my wife and was like, “When this gets down to $50,000, I’ve got to go get a job.” And luckily it didn’t come to [that]. TC: What did you learn from Bloomberg that you’re replicating? BT: The [most important] thing for Mike is his culture. So our business in some ways is a microcosm of Bloomberg, where we’re all in a bullpen and [operate in a] very flat hierarchy with total transparency and we try to treat people really well and pay them really well, and we assume that we’re going to get great talent and it’s going to pay off. If you look at almost all of his businesses, and as mayor, his real skill set is that he attracts [talented people], he knows how to recruit them, how to support them, and how to give them the confidence they need to take risks. TC: There are other political strategy firms working with tech companies, but Tusk Ventures is the only one that everyone knows of because you’re so high profile. Why not operate behind the scenes? BT: Deal flow is the lifeblood of any VC, and that’s true for us, too. And in some ways, because I didn’t come up through this world at all, there had to be a way to say “Hey, here’s who we are, here’s what we do. If you have a really interesting company with a really big problem, we’re willing to take it on and we’re willing to do it for equity and be part of your team.” But it took being out there enough for people to realize it. TC: Are other political strategists starting to emulate your approach? BT: I hope not. It’s a challenge in a sense that first, we’re able to do all of it for equity — though I pay my people in real dollars — so there’s a lot of financial risk that you have to be willing to take and I’m able to do that. Also, typically, if you’re someone like me and you’re five years into your political consulting firm, you sell it to one of these big holding companies like WPP or Omnicom. And they’d never let you do something like this. So I’d like to think there are some barriers to entry to replicating our model, but I’m sure someone else can come in and do it, too. TC: Are you interested in running for public office? BT: No, I mean, the only job to me that’s worth having is being mayor of New York City. It’s a great job. I did launch a super-PAC about a year ago to get rid of our current mayor, Bill de Blasio, just because I think we deserve better than a mayor who’s under seven separate federal corruption investigations and who comes to work at 11 a.m and doesn’t work on Fridays and doesn’t care about substance. But that’s different than saying I want the job. Also, I’m an independent – another thing I got from Mike Bloomberg. And kind of like in San Francisco, in New York City, if you aren’t a Democrat, it’s exceptionally hard to win. TC: Anyone you’d get behind right now for president in 2020? BT: I would really like for it to not be a U.S. senator . . . When Mike was thinking about running [for U.S. president] last year, I made the case internally that Sheryl Sandberg should be our VP. He wanted someone with national security experience and picked Admiral [Michael] Mullen and I don’t know that she would have taken it anyway. But I felt like she would be the kind of person who could really connect with voters in a way that would complement Mike’s skill sets. So I still think she would be great. TC: What about a ticket with Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg? BT: Yeah. [Laughs]. It would be an interesting ticket. There’s this talk of Tom Hanks, maybe he’d be good; we have had an actor president before. [Starbucks CEO] Howard Schultz plays footsie a lot with running for president. I think one of the things that Trump proved is . . . rather than working your way up the political ladder, you’re much better off saying, “Here’s the job I want” and running for it as an outsider. My guess is the strongest candidate for the Democrats will not be a politician, and that’s the best shot of taking on Trump. TC: One thing you’ve done with great success is mobilize the user base of some of your clients like Uber and FanDuel, making it easy for them to click on a link and pressure their local representatives into acquiescence. What do you do in cases where that’s not possible, where the user base isn’t necessarily consumers but maybe patients or other? BT: [S]ometimes you have that passion and you really harness it and sometimes you don’t and you’re running more of an inside game. In any given campaign . . . there’s always a political decision-maker, and what most furthers their ambition or heightens their insecurity is what you want to play on to get to where you want to go. If you can do that with emails and tweets, and they say, “Holy shit, I don’t care that much about fantasy sports and they let something pass [as with FanDuel], great. If you can’t, and you’ve got to hire a bunch of lobbyists, that’s what you do. It not just varies by company but by jurisdiction [and] by fight. People are always asking me, “Do I ask for permission or beg for forgiveness?” and it depends. Who are you begging for forgiveness from? If it’s from some taxi regulator and you maybe get fined $100 because you have the wrong license plate, that’s one thing. If you’re asking a U.S. attorney for forgiveness, and you’re looking at three to five [years in prison], that’s a different issue. TC: Let’s talk quickly about some issues that are front and center for some founders. First: contractors versus full-time employees. Top of mind for this administration or not so much? BT: It’s top of mind for the [House] speaker. I know Paul Ryan and his office care a lot about this issue. I think there are Senators like [Marco] Rubio who engaged in this on the campaign, too. I don’t think the White House has any real awareness of this one way or the other. TC: Self-driving cars and trucks? BT: If you think about it, the politics of autonomous are fascinating. In Pittsburgh, [Pittsburgh Mayor] Bill Peduto’s entire political future is based on [being] the guy who transformed Pittsburgh from a rust belt manufacturing city to a knowledge economy city, so therefore, the optics of autonomous Ubers are amazing for him. [H]ere in San Francisco — I’m going to generalize here – you people don’t vote in municipal elections and therefore your voice is irrelevant in municipal elections. And the people who do vote in municipal elections don’t like tech, right? So for [SF Mayor] Ed Lee or [SF Board of Supervisors member] Aaron Peskin, it’s great politics to go after tech companies. So a lot of it still comes back to: what does the individual office holder need and care about? What are the inputs? And that will help you figure out what the outputs are. TC: The Affordable Care Act. Obviously, it won’t be gone in a flash as President Trump first suggested. What should health care startups be doing while they wait? BT: First, if you believe your model could be significantly improved by whatever Washington does eventually pass, then you’ve got to get into the game. And you have to have a good lobbyist in D.C. and a good strategy. Second, it seems a likely scenario that they throw a lot of it to the states and the states decide. That will create chaos, but that also means there’s opportunity. I think you can look at it and say, “Okay, here are states where we think they may like our model. Let’s get in there now and start working them so that when they make decisions on Medicaid funding, for example, or insurance mandates, our position is front and center.” TC: What about Trump’s immigration ban [which some worry will lead to another executive order that impacts H-1B visa holders]? BT: There’s the executive order, there’s broader immigration policy, there’s the wall [that Trump wants to erect between the U.S. and Mexico], then there are H-1B visas. I think with H-1B visas, the trick is to work with the Republican Congress to reject it. You can do a lot of harm through executive orders, and so far, this president seems to be trying as hard as he can. But most of the big stuff has to happen legislatively. . . [E]veryone is spending so much emotional energy on Trump, but don’t forget about Ryan and [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell and all those people because they can be a pretty good bulwark against stupid stuff and they can help you pass some good stuff.

"Asset management startups using blockchain get their own trade body: MAMA – TechCrunch. An international consortium of leading asset management companies, investors, technology and service providers in the Blockchain ecosystem have formed a new industry organisation (if you consider blockchain tech to be an industry…) to “work towards a new vision for asset management using blockchain and other supporting decentralized technologies.” In other words, the asset management industry — which reached $84.9 trillion in value in 2016 and is predicted to almost double to hit $145.4 trillion in 2025 — is about to be massively disrupted by blockchain technologies, and pioneers in this space are clubbing together to promote the tech and push for common standards. The Multichain Asset Management Association (or MAMA for short) was recently formed at the first annual M-0 conference in Zug, Switzerland. Initiated by Melonport AG, MME Legal Tax Compliance and Bussmann Advisory with the support of the Swistzerland-based Canton of Zug Economic Affairs, MAMA’s 22+ founding members will function as a trade body. Zug has become ‘ground zero’ for the nascent crypto industry because of its legal oversight over the new financial area. MAMA says it aims to become a “definitive source of information and a hub for the latest thinking and knowledge in the industry with the goal to establish itself as a reliable, thought provoking, responsible body capable of making quick decisions and lobbying for blockchain-based asset management”. Founder members include: University of Luzern, Credit Suisse AG, Passport Capita, JTC Group, Melonport, MME Legal Tax Compliance, Bussmann Advisory, ConsenSys uPort, Bitcoin Suisse, Crypto Fund AG, Kenetic Capital, Lendroid, 0x Project, Ethfinex, Omega One, Vo1t, Kryptonite, Cyber Fund, Neufund, Midas Technologies AG, Lakeside Partners, Virtual Capital Ventures amongst others. Melonport AG is the private company behind the Melon protocol, and was the main actor which brought a lot of these players together.Its aim is to build open, reliable and efficient technology regulated investment products. Mona El Isa, CEO of Melonport “An entire ecosystem of new Asset Management tools underpinned by open-source, efficient, secure technology is emerging faster than people realise – and it is crucial that the innovators behind these technologies should be at the forefront of discussions with regulators and working to shape future regulation on them globally” said . The goal of MAMA, incorporated as a Swiss Association, will be to provide a forum for discussion among leaders and innovators in their industry with the purpose of creating a unified, industry-wide voice to tackle important issues in the industry, including: “The Asset Management industry is in the middle of a digital disruption. The MAMA initiative will be the catalyst for the business disruption embracing distributed ledger technologies” said Oliver Bussmann, founder and managing partner of Bussmann Advisory.",0.0
"There is still time for President Obama, Congress to protect consumers | TheHill. Americans recently made their voices heard by electing a new president and Congress. Whether your candidate was elected or not, open, free and transparent elections are what make our democratic system function so smoothly. Another core principle of our democracy is the freedom to express an opinion without the threat of retaliation. Congress has an opportunity to fortify that right in the coming weeks through two pending pieces of “free expression” legislation. Before President-elect Trump and Congress take office in a few, short months, our current elected officials will be focused on funding our federal government through a continuing resolution, yet they also have the ability to address the problem of “speech bullying” once and for all. Passing legislation that directly confronts the systemic abuses of our legal system used to silence the voices of American consumers should not wait until a new Congress is sworn in next year. So how exactly is our freedom of expression under attack in the United States? Some unscrupulous businesses are hiding non-disparagement clauses in their contracts in order to prohibit the posting of critical feedback about the company’s goods and services. Other businesses are using strategic lawsuits against public participation, better known as SLAPPs, which primarily aim to silence opinions that those businesses disagree with. For example, Prestigious Pets LLC, a pet-sitting company in Plano, Texas, filed a SLAPP lawsuit last year for $6,766 against a couple simply for posting a negative review on Yelp—that’s right, $6,776 for sharing an honest opinion about the dissatisfactory service they received while out of town. In addition to the monetary fine, the company also wanted the couple to remove the review in the hopes that other potential customers would remain in the dark about their service complaints. Put simply, consumers don’t currently have protections against businesses that use these types of shady business practices to intimidate their customers. That needs to change. Fortunately, there are currently two pieces of bi-partisan legislation designed to protect American consumers from the attempts to chill speech described above, namely: the Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA) and the Securing Participation, Engagement, and Knowledge Freedom by Reducing Egregious Efforts Act (SPEAK FREE Act). Both bills will protect a consumer’s right to speak out on issues of importance to them – through different means – and both need bipartisan support if they are to become law. In the immediate future, the U.S. Senate can provide consumers with initial protections provided in the CRFA by banning non-disparagement clauses from consumer contracts. We are optimistic that the Senate will send the CRFA through the legislative process and to President Obama’s desk after the House of Representatives unanimously supported the legislation on Sept. 12 of this year. As for the SPEAK FREE Act, we will continue to work on consumers’ behalf to prevent egregious lawsuits like the one in Plano, Texas and countless others; we need a national standard to protect all consumers from this kind of retaliation. Today, 28 states, plus Washington, D.C., have anti-SLAPP statutes on the books in order to protect consumers from these dishonest tactics. These 28 statutes, however, don’t protect the millions of citizens living in states without such a law -- states like Wisconsin, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia, and New Hampshire just to name a few. Now is the time for commonsense, bipartisan bills to protect the thoughts and opinions of the American people. Americans rely on consumer reviews to make important decisions regarding medical treatment, childcare and travel. In fact, a survey by BrightLocal found that 84 percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. However, the value these services provide is in serious jeopardy if Congress does not move forward with passing these critical pieces of legislation. It is no secret that during the last eight years Congress has been crippled by hyperpartisanship, resulting in Washington gridlock. However, advancing legislation that will protect Americans’ right to freely express themselves, both online and off, is an issue all elected officials should unite around.  The views expressed by authors are their own and not the views of The Hill.

"Binary Capital delays fund close in wake of Justin Caldbeck situation. Binary Capital yesterday delayed its plans to close on upwards of $75 million in new capital for its second fund. This comes after co-founding partner Justin Caldbeck took an indefinite leave of absence in the wake of sexual harassment allegations by women entrepreneurs, Axios has learned. Below is the note to investors, which was then followed by Caldbeck's longer statement about his leave of absence: The San Francisco-based venture firm originally raised $175 million for its second fund last summer, but was seeking additional capital after Lowercase Capital's Matt Mazzeo agreed to join as its third general partner. It is unclear how close Binary had gotten to its $75 million goal, nor what it plans to do next.

"The Quinceañera, a Rite of Passage in Transition - The New York Times. The Cedillo family was already running an hour late, so when the Range Rover stretch limo dropped them off at St. Agatha Church in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Lucero Cedillo and her court of nine chambelanes, the equivalent of groomsmen, dashed out of the car. Lucero led the way, holding the hem of her strapless ball gown in one hand and a matching bouquet of silk garden roses in the other. Her parents, Alberta and Abundio Cedillo, followed. From a distance, the chambelanes could have easily been mistaken for cadets at a police academy graduation, walking in sync wearing black suits with gold aiguillettes around their right shoulders, eyes hidden under peaked hats with gold insignia. The Rev. Silvio A. Ortiz began the quinceañera Roman Catholic Mass by congratulating Lucero, who knelt before him at the altar. He blessed several items, including a porcelain doll, a symbol of Lucero’s childhood. Applause echoed through mostly empty pews. Then Lucero and her court scurried into the limo, heading for the party, a catered affair for 150 guests at a Greek Orthodox church hall in Bay Ridge. Widely celebrated among Latinos, the quinceañera marks an important milestone in a girl’s life. Part birthday party, part rite of passage, it symbolizes a girl’s entrance into womanhood when turning 15, traditionally showcasing her purity and readiness for marriage. But the quinceañera has also been Americanized. And the increasingly elaborate celebrations reflect the changing landscape of Latinos in the United States. In fact, Lucero’s quinceañera was not, strictly speaking, a quinceañera at all. The celebration, held in February, had many of the traditional trappings: a Mass, a catered bash with live music, and a ceremony in which Lucero’s transition to womanhood was marked by trading her flats for heels. But Lucero turned 15 a year ago this was an adapted Sweet 16. “I wanted to switch it up,” Lucero said. “I wanted to keep some of my parents’ traditions but celebrate at a different age. ” “It’s how it’s done in the United States,” she added. “The modern quinceañera has become the   manifestation of what it means to be visible in an American system on your own terms,” said Rachel V.   a folklorist and professor in the Department of Mexican American    Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. At the same time, she added, the celebrations create “a space that recalls your cultural heritage. ” Lucero initially felt reluctant to ask her parents for the party, calling it “a big waste of money on just one day. ” Contemporary quinceañeras do tend to have a hefty price tag. Event planners, bakers and caterers, hair stylists, makeup artists and D. J. s have all become part of what will soon be a   industry, said María Bejarano, director of Quinceañera Magazine, a trade publication. “When you put the numbers together, it’s stratospheric,” Ms. Bejarano said. “The quinceañera business is a monster that keeps on growing. ” The celebration has spawned specialized retailers, fashion expos, even a reality show, “Quiero Mis Quinces,” promoting custom parties. Disney’s “Frozen” was among the most popular themes last year, according to quinceañera store owners. Many girls are incorporating decidedly secular and   elements. They choreograph their traditional dance routines to mainstream pop music instead of waltzes. Lucero opened the dance floor to a Beyoncé mix. In 2013, Disney introduced a line of   quinceañera dresses, retailing for $300 to $900, and its theme parks offer catered events like the Belle of the Ball package, which starts at $20, 000. For an additional $2, 500, quinceañeras can make royal entrances in     carriages. In New York, a quinceañera celebration averages around $10, 000, according to Alfonso Caviedes, who owns Fantasy, a   dress shop in Jackson Heights, Queens. He offers a layaway system on dresses, which on average cost $600. “Some families cannot afford to pay for the dresses up front,” Mr. Caviedes said. Rosa Jimenez, who owns Bridal by Rosa’s in East Harlem, puts the typical cost even higher. “I would recommend that families set aside at least $15, 000,” she said. “It’s like a wedding. ” The median household income for Latinos in the United States in 2014 was just over $42, 000, according to the Census Bureau, and in New York City the figure is lower. But the high prices don’t dissuade families from celebrating. Villa Russo, an event hall in Queens, charges up to $18, 700 a night for 275 guests. About 30 quinceañeras a year are held there. Families book custom bakers, like Iva Velazquez in Brooklyn. Ms. Velazquez supplies cakes for 15 quinceañeras a year her prices can quickly run into the thousands, depending on sugar flowers, ruffles and other intricate details. Some have come to resent such extravagance. “Nowadays, families are disrespectful to the church,” said Ana Morales, quinceañera coordinator at St. Paul’s Church in East Harlem. “They bring in these loud musicians, like mariachis, to the quinceañera. The parties in the pews are taking pictures they are on their cellphones. They seem to have forgotten why they are in church. ” As a result, St. Paul’s has been less inclined to hold such Masses. “The quinceañera is a symbol of status and recognition,” Ms. Bejarano, the magazine director, said. “Families want to celebrate big. But it’s these strong ties to tradition that distract parents from thinking about how they will pay for their daughters’ future education. ” Professor   of the University of Texas, finds such criticism problematic. “People don’t tend to question lavish bat mitzvahs,” she said. “People make the assumptions that Jewish communities are more affluent, whereas Latino communities are stereotyped as impoverished. ” “It’s like talking to someone who is on a diet and saying, ‘You shouldn’t really eat that,’ and assuming that they don’t know what they are putting in their mouth,” she added. Lucero’s parents, cooks by trade, had been saving for this day for two years. Now both 50 years old, they immigrated to the United States from Mexico in their early 20s. “My parents grew up poor,” Lucero said. “They used to work in the fields. My mom, when she first got to the U. S. she used to work in factories. My mom never had a quince, so she told me, ‘I didn’t have a chance, but you do! ’” “Of course this is a sacrifice for us,” Mr. Cedillo acknowledged. “But we don’t see it that way. This is tradition. Lucero is a good daughter, and she deserves a party. ” The quinceañera appeals to both new immigrants and those established for several generations, Professor   said, but for different reasons. For newer arrivals, it’s about “creating a display of affluence,” she said. For   or   Latino Americans, the quinceañera has become a way to reclaim traditions with which they’ve lost touch. Staging these elaborate celebrations requires a system of patronage, particularly in Mexican communities, in both Mexico and the United States. The girl’s parents reach out to relatives and friends to help pay for everything from the limo to the beer. Lucero’s godparents  —   12 relatives and friends had been selected  —   helped cover the celebration’s cost: around $13, 000. At the church hall in Bay Ridge, Lucero walked slowly between two columns of chambelanes as they held their costume swords. When she arrived at a white throne, two of her godparents handed her a long, bedazzled scepter and placed a crystal tiara atop her carefully curled hair. Mr. Cedillo knelt before his daughter with a silk pillow holding sparkling silver shoes. Lucero lifted her ball gown just enough to let her feet emerge from the layers of fabric. He removed her flats, swapping them for the   heels. The moment, a traditional part of the quinceañera, is supposed to be the first time a young girl wears high heels and dances with a man. This was not quite the case with Lucero. “I’ve danced since I was 9,” she said after the party. “This is definitely not the first time I’ve put on heels. ” At nearly 1 a. m. the staff was clearing away empty plates. Lucero’s parents called up the godparents and handed each a basket of fruit and blankets as thanks for their sponsorship and attendance. The family huddled to say a prayer. Then the lights dimmed and banda  —   traditional   Mexican music  —   blasted through the speakers. Lucero’s father and uncle emerged from the kitchen, carrying a roasted pig on their shoulders. The guests had formed a running circle around the dance floor, and Lucero joined them after changing into a   cream dress. Soon she was dancing barefoot to her own manic adolescent rhythm, her sparkling high heels clutched tightly at her side.",-1.0
"Alleged Grooming Gang Charged with Multiple Rape, Child Abduction, Trafficking, and Drug Offences.   people are in court on over 170 charges of rape, child abduction, trafficking, drug dealing, and other crimes following a child sex abuse inquiry. [The alleged offences are said to have been carried out in Huddersfield by 27 men and two women between 2004 and 2011. Their victims were girls aged between 11 and 17.  A similar “Asian grooming gang” was charged with 23 counts of abusing girls aged 12 and 13 in January 2017 in Rotherham. They shouted “Allahu Akbar!” in court as they were sentenced. Five men from another gang which believed itself “untouchable” were convicted in Warwick in December 2016. There have been a number of such cases in recent years, which have in many cases involved men from the Muslim community targeting underage white girls. The authorities have been observed as proving reluctant to tackle the problem for fear of being accused of racism, with endemic sexual grooming in Rotherham being effectively covered up until a whistleblower came forward. This culture of impunity still persists to some extent: in October 2016, one grooming victim told Breitbart London that, when she went to the police, they refused to act. “I’ve gave [the police] about eighty names” she said. “At first I tried to give the names anonymously but was told that I’d have to give an official statement. ” She eventually did so, but a discovered that the case had been quietly dropped a year later. “None of the men were ever arrested. I don’t think they even knew there was a case. ” The accused in the Huddersfield case, who are presently in court, are predominantly residents of that city, as well as Bradford, Dewsbury, Dudley, Manchester, and Sheffield.

"Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize Isn’t About Music.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, The Swedish Academy’s official bibliography for Bob Dylan, recipient of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, begins with the category “Works in English. ” The first listed entry is the Bob Dylan Song Book, a 1965 collection of sheet music and lyrics, and the last is If Not For You, a   2016 children’s book that that illustrated the lyrics of a 1970 Dylan song. His   1971 prose collection Tarantula and 2004 memoir Chronicles, Volume One are in there, too. So “works,” in this context, means books. They’re listed before the albums that provided the lyrics that make up many of those Dylan books —  the albums whose music, in the Nobel Committee’s word, gave Dylan “the status of an icon. ” Tangled Up in Ol’ Blue Eyes, Handwringing about “what is literature?” seems inevitable after the announcement that a rock star has taken the global writing community’s biggest award. But no great existential crisis is needed. The Nobel Committee could have decided that with this prize it wanted to expand the definition of “literature” to include recorded music, a hugely influential and relatively young art form that doesn’t have an award of   prestige dedicated to it. But it seems to have declined to do so. Dylan is winning 8 million kronor ($932, 786) for his words as they are written and not sung —  affording him a wild degree of praise for something that is not the main achievement of his career. After this morning’s announcement, an interviewer put to the Nobel Permanent Secretary Sara Danius the notion that because Dylan isn’t known for novels or traditional poetry, the committee has “widened the horizon” of the literature prize. Darius pushed back: Well, it may look that way. But really, we haven’t, in a way. If you look back, far back, 2, 500 years or so ago, you discover Homer and Sappho. And they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to, they were meant to be performed, often together with instruments. It’s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho and we enjoy it. And same thing with Bob Dylan. He can be read and should be read, and is a great poet in the grand English poetic tradition. “He can be read and should be read. ” With those words, Darius is advocating for people to turn off their speakers and pick up a copy of Bob Dylan’s Lyrics tomes, complete collections of his words that have come out in various editions since 1985. She also mentioned that people may want to listen to Blonde on Blonde as an entrypoint. But listening is not what this award is about. There’s little that’s inherently controversial about praising words originally meant for vocal delivery. Playwrights have won the Nobel Prize for Literature before. But in an era when songwriting and song performance and song recording are tied together, when many musicians’ literary voices are first received via their literal voices, lyrics alone should inevitably have a hard time competing with “pure” poetry or prose. They’re trying to accomplish different things. Bob Dylan is not exempt from this idea, even though he’s spawned an industry of college   analysis. Here’s Michiko Kakutani 31 years ago in a generally positive New York Times review of Dylan’s Lyrics  : Simply reading a song, we miss the ways in which the words interact with the music —  how, say, the sardonic lyrics to many of the songs on ’’Highway 61 Revisited’’ counterpoint the upbeat, even exuberant tracks   and we are deprived, as well, of the point of view supplied by Mr. Dylan’s raw, insistent inflections and distinctive phrasings. Numbers like ’’Lay, Lady, Lay,’’ ’’Blowin’ in the Wind’’ and even ’’Like a Rolling Stone’’ feel considerably more trite as prose poems than as songs, and many of Mr. Dylan’s weaker efforts  —  ’’New Pony,’’ say, or ’’Emotionally Yours’’ —  simply collapse into pretentious posturing when separated from their propulsive tracks, which at least helped to endow them with a modicum of conviction on the records. The Nobel Committee would seem to disagree with Kakutani. Or rather, perhaps, it’s asserting that even with the inherent limitations of written lyrics, Dylan’s still rate as so good as to deserve recognition. And that is, make no mistake, huge recognition. Today’s award says that a byproduct of Dylan’s main job is as good or better than the life’s work of Haruki Murakami, Philip Roth, Adonis, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, or so many other authors theoretically in contention. His worthiness for that honor cannot be determined by doing what his fans most enjoy doing, hearing a Bob Dylan song.",-0.5
" President-Elect Trump Vows To Deport 2-3 Million Undocumented Immigrants.  For the first time since the election,   Donald Trump has detailed specifics of his immigration policies, vowing to deport some   million undocumented immigrants and proceed with plans to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico. In a 60 Minutes interview to air Sunday evening, Trump was asked about his immigration campaign promises and said that he plans to immediately deport two to three million undocumented immigrants upon taking office, with immigration officials making a “determination” about the remaining undocumented people once the border is “secure. ” “What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,” Trump said. “But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally. ” He also   to building a wall between the US and Mexico, but conceded parts of the wall may instead consist of fencing. “For certain areas I would [use fencing] but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,” he said. “I’m very good at this, it’s called construction. ” Since the election Tuesday, the Mexican government has reiterated that they will not pay for the wall. “We are in the business of eliminating barriers,” Mexican foreign minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told CBS News. “That’s why we would not consider paying for any wall that puts barriers between our integration and competitiveness. ”   Donald Trump says the wall on the Mexican border may have fence segments, tonight on #60Minutes:  …     https:  .  Once Trump’s initial immigration policies are in place, the   said officials would “make a determination” about the remaining undocumented immigrants. “After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that,” he said. “But before we make that determination  …    it’s very important, we are going to secure our border. ” Two days after the election, former House Speaker and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich expressed doubts that Mexico would pay for a hypothetical   border wall, but called the structure a “great campaign device. ” Gingrich added that he thought the new president would spend a lot of time “controlling the border,” and that he could reduce the flow of refugees into the country “by 99 percent in one day by just being practical. ”   ",-1.0
"Sacha Baron Cohen Takes Aim at Billionaire ’Greed’ with Latest Character.   Sacha Baron Cohen will poke fun at the seemingly insatiable greed of elite billionaires with his latest character created for the screen, a role based on the disgraced British billionaire and retailer owner Philip Green. [According to The Sun, Baron Cohen, 45, will play the role of a fictional retail billionaire in an upcoming film titled Greed, emulating the character of Green, the billionaire businessman heavily criticized for refusing to uphold an employee pension scheme as head of the British department store chain British Home Stores (BHS).  The actor previously found both critical and commercial success with cinematic characters Borat and Bruno. “Sacha will have an almost uncanny resemblance to Sir Philip and those close to the producers believes it’s more than a nod to him,” a source close to the film told The Sun. “He’ll look more portly, with balding gray hair which is left long at the back. ” “The transformation will mean nobody will realise it’s Sacha, meaning he’ll be able to get up to his old tricks again,” the source added. Another source told the newspaper the film would be a “satirical take on the world of the  ” and based on “the lavish lifestyles of the elite,   billionaire businessmen who shamelessly invest money into offshore tax havens. ” Greed will be directed by filmmaker Michael Winterbottom, the man behind titles such as Welcome to Sarajevo, Wonderland, and 24 Hour Party People. Baron Cohen received critical acclaim in 2006 for his   film Borat, depicting the travels of a Kazakh reporter across America. Other films by the actor such as Brüno and The Dictator have been well received. However, Baron Cohen’s most recent film The Brothers Grimsby, which follows the life of a football hooligan and his spy agent brother, was a box office flop, generating just $3. 2 million in the comedian’s   opening weekend at the box office.

"NYPD Police Union President: ’Law Enforcement Nationwide Has Been Demoralized’ - Breitbart. On Sunday, New York City’s AM 970 host John Catsimatidis spoke with NYPD Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins on his “The Cats Roundtable” program and the two discussed the state of law enforcement in the United States.  According to Mullins, law enforcement nationwide “has been demoralized” due to some of the isolated incidents that become big headlines. “The problem now is that for the past two to three years members of law enforcement have been under attack nationwide,” Mullins explained “The perps on the street know that they can get away with the things they normally did and carry the guns. ‘So, I get arrested. The chances of me being stopped again are probably minimal.’ So they go back out and play the odds. I really see a police force that has been reactive rather than proactive. You really can’t blame the officer anymore because the department and law enforcement nationwide has been demoralized. ” “What’s really being missed is that police officers throughout the country are truly the good guys. They are really doing the job the public wants them to do. But, when you have those isolated incidents, it becomes big headlines and then there’s the perception all police officers are that way and that’s just simply not true.

"Sen. Jeff Sessions Ties Heroin Epidemic to Lack of Border Security - Breitbart. Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) says a lack of border security is playing a significant role in the increased use of heroin in the U. S.[During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday on “America’s epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse,” Sessions pressed Michael Botticelli, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, on the root causes of the increased rates of heroin use.  “Mr. Botticelli, you’re supposed to set drug policy for America. You’re what they used to call the drug czar. Do you agree that reduced price, high purity, and increased accessibility of heroin are the major drivers of the recent increase in rates of heroin use?” Sessions asked. Botticelli agreed, saying, “The availability of very cheap, very pure heroin in the United States, as well as untreated addiction, has significantly increased heroin use rates in the United States. ” According to Sessions, a key aspect of the availability of low cost heroin has been poor border security. “The lack of enforcement at the border is a big part of this,” Sessions said, recalling his work as an assistant U. S. attorney in the 1970s prosecuting 17 small heroin cases. At the time, he said, the heroin was coming from Turkey. Sessions continued that several years later in 1981, following a crackdown by President Jimmy Carter, he returned as the U. S. Attorney and it was a number of years before there were any heroin cases. “Supply is important,” he said. “We can impact supply —  heroin at low prices and high purity on the streets [is] dangerous, and prosecutions are critical to this. People need to go to jail who are pushing this kind of addictive power into our communities and destroying lives and families. ” Watch: ",1.0

The storm, which dumped more than 30 inches of rain on parts of southern Louisiana through the weekend  —   enough to fill 10. 4 million Olympic pools  —   has caused flooding damage to some 40, 000 homes and required the rescue of 30, 000 people.

The declaration opened up federal resources for 21 parishes, including some of the hardest hit areas of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Helena, and Tangipahoa, according to the declaration.  On Tuesday, eight additional parishes were added to the declaration, Gov. John Bel Edwards said. “Thousands of people in Louisiana have lost everything they own and need our help now,” said Brad Kieserman, vice president of Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross, said in a statement. “This disaster is the worst to hit the United States since Superstorm Sandy and we anticipate it will cost at least $30 million, a number which may grow as we learn more about the scope and magnitude of the devastation. ” At least 70, 000 people registered for FEMA disaster assistance, White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said Wednesday.  On Friday the governor declared a state of emergency for the entire state as a result of the severe weather. “The rain continues to fall in the areas that have been most impacted already,” Edwards said, calling the flooding “historic” and “unprecedented. ” The rains prompted the National Weather Service to issue a flood warning for much of southeastern Louisiana as an area of low pressure with tropical characteristics slowly moved west and across the state late last week and over the weekend. By Saturday morning, search and rescue operations were in effect and the National Guard had deployed   vehicles, boats, and helicopters.  Several bodies were recovered from the waters across the region, some inside submerged vehicles, while others were swept away in the torrential flood. The Louisiana Department of Health reported five deaths in East Baton Rouge Parish, three in Tangipahoa Parish, two in St. Helena Parish, two in Livingston Parish, and one in Rapides Parish. It was the third   disaster in Louisiana this year. In March, severe flooding left several people dead and forced thousands to evacuate. James Lane, whose home in the town of Sorrento was inundated with floodwaters, said he was beginning the clean up effort Wednesday. “I can’t even think about what to do, just got to go with it as it comes in,” Lane told the Associated Press. “We actually lost everything in Katrina, came here 10 years later, lost everything again. ”  ",-1.0
"Hollywood Hate: White Man Tells Stacey Dash She’s Not Black.

Either we want to have segregation or integration,” Dash said Wednesday on Fox and Friends.   “If we don’t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NCAAP] Image Awards where you’re only awarded if you’re black.

"When I Was Diagnosed With Bipolar Disorder, People Thought I Was Cursed. When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2008, at the age of 24, all I wanted to know was whether I would be all right. It was the first time I had ever heard about the condition, and many people around me simply believed that I had been cursed. Even though my parents sought medical help, the psychiatrist who diagnosed me did not give any information about the illness, the side effects of the medication prescribed for me, or the manic and depressive bouts that I could expect. My story is not unique. The World Health Organization estimates that 1 out of every 4 people in the world will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime  —   including depression and anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and   psychosis. In a developing country like Kenya, these patients and their families  —   including me at one point  —   must compete for space at the overcrowded, understaffed and underfunded Mathari Mental Hospital in Nairobi, the main referral hospital for the general public. A national audit in 2011 found that Kenya has just 79 psychiatrists  —   only 50 working in the public sector  —   to serve a population of over 40 million. But things could be looking up. In April, the World Bank and the WHO met in Washington, D. C. to look at ways to move mental health onto the international development agenda, bolstered by new research that shows an investment of $147 billion in treating mental health issues could result in total economic returns of $400 billion as health and productivity are restored. There’s no doubt that $147 billion is a lot of money. While there’s talk of building more hospitals, there are some relatively simple,   ways to begin addressing the issue. Awareness campaigns that inform and start conversations about mental health and mental illnesses are crucial. After I found out I had bipolar disorder, I lived with   and guilt. At times I considered suicide. This prompted me to start a blog, My Mind, My Funk, where I write openly about dealing with severe depression and provide resources for people in Africa going through similar mental health troubles. I’ve also written about another condition I face: epilepsy. Even though epilepsy is a nervous system disorder, some people in Kenya consider it a mental health condition with the reasoning that, like depression, it happens ”in the head.” Lack of proper mental health information and support is one of the primary obstacles patients face. Cultural beliefs that often attribute mental health conditions to witchcraft also make it hard for people to get proper and timely diagnosis, and in some cases they are shunned and ridiculed. In Kenya, many families dealing with brothers or sisters who have severe mental illness resort to chaining them up at home, abandoning them in rudimentary mental health institutions, or for urban families, sending them to live with grandparents in the countryside if they can’t find anyone else to care for them. As you can imagine, the appetite for information about mental illness in Kenya is overwhelming. So last year I established Kenya’s first dedicated text message hotline to deal with mental health inquiries and inquiries about epilepsy as well. People text in their issues: ”I’m feeling very depressed.” ”My girlfriend is driving me up the wall.” ”Someone just had a seizure  —   what do I do?” Trained volunteer counselors respond via text. In its first year of operation in 2015, the line got 25, 000 messages from Kenyans across the country. Currently, we’re restructuring the hotline so it can better serve people. We want to find a way to answer general questions  —   like what are the symptoms of depression or epilepsy  —   to free the line up for specific questions that require more personal answers from our counselors.  It is certainly good news that mental health is finally becoming part of the development conversation. But the discussion must include voices like mine  —   voices of people living with mental health conditions in the developing world  —   so we can help global institutions design the best mental health care systems for even the most remote African villages, where people may not have the words to describe mental health issues. And more important than fancy new hospitals are community mental health projects that can shift public perceptions of the illness at schools, villages and the workplace. A better understanding would mean that people with mental illness might feel less isolated  —   and that their families might not automatically turn to institutionalization. Not everyone who develops a mental health condition needs to see a psychiatrist or take medication, but everyone with a mental health condition  —   no matter where they live  —   needs an accepting environment.

"FIFA Shares Results of Investigation and Tries to Turn the Page - The New York Times. Nearly two years after a sweeping corruption case first felled top leaders of FIFA, the   governing body for international soccer announced on Friday that it had cataloged its officials’ wrongdoing and delivered the results of a   internal investigation to government authorities. The investigation, undertaken by two prominent law firms in 2015, drew on millions of documents and interviews with current and former employees. Among those interviewed was Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s longtime president who stepped down amid scandal, his lawyer confirmed. In recent days, FIFA said, the organization turned over the last in a series of inquiry reports  —   totaling 1, 300 pages, with an additional 20, 000 pages of supplementary evidence  —   to Switzerland’s office of the attorney general. Swiss prosecutors, who have named Mr. Blatter and his former top deputy, Jérôme Valcke, as subjects of a criminal investigation, are expected to share the information with the United States Justice Department, which led international scrutiny of FIFA by charging dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies with racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and bribery in 2015. In its announcement, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, seemed eager to turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in its history. “FIFA committed to conducting a thorough and comprehensive investigation of the facts so we could hold wrongdoers within football accountable and cooperate with the authorities,” Mr. Infantino said. “FIFA will now return its focus to the game. ” The American and Swiss investigations are, however, continuing  —   deconstructing schemes spanning decades to which more than a dozen have confessed. So, too, is an investigation in France, where Mr. Valcke lives. That inquiry is being conducted by France’s national financial prosecutor’s office, which, like the American investigators’ has relied on cooperation from Switzerland’s attorney general. Swiss privacy laws dictate that FIFA’s information must be funneled through Swiss authorities. FIFA, based in Zurich, is forbidden to deliver documents directly to other governments, which frustrated FIFA’s lawyers during early stages of the United States’ case, as they sought to telegraph their cooperation and to solidify FIFA’s place as a victim in the eyes of the authorities. “The office of the attorney general of Switzerland appreciates the preliminary exchange of information and FIFA’s close and consistent cooperation,” Ladina Gapp, a spokeswoman for that office, wrote in an email on Friday. “Since the criminal proceedings are ongoing, FIFA is restricted from releasing or commenting on the findings from its investigation. ” The narrative reports and corresponding evidence newly turned over by FIFA might not be revelatory for government authorities, who have obtained voluminous information through their own interviews, raids and specific document requests, to which FIFA has responded on a rolling basis over the last two years. But the reports, produced by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel and the Swiss law firm Niederer Kraft  Frey, catalog FIFA’s insight into its leadership’s possible crimes and signal a symbolic moment as the organization seeks to emerge from the scandal. The United States has charged more than 40 defendants in its case. Of those, 19 people have so far publicly pleaded guilty, along with multiple companies. As recently as December 2016, a new guilty plea was unsealed. Five soccer officials are actively fighting charges in the United States and set to stand trial in the fall, while numerous others remain abroad and have not answered to the charges against them. The investigations have been dizzying  —   and expensive  —   for FIFA, which has asked the United States government for tens of millions of dollars, a portion of the money that the convicted defendants have pledged to pay the Justice Department in restitution. The scandal has unseated dozens of international and national soccer officials, predominantly from South and Central America, some with deep roots in the sport and their names emblazoned on administration buildings. At least one implicated leader remains in power: Marco Polo Del Nero, the president of Brazil’s soccer association, who was indicted by the United States in 2015. Mr. Infantino, who succeeded Mr. Blatter as FIFA’s president last year, has broadly condemned the disfiguring corruption and advocated change, but he has not called for Mr. Del Nero’s resignation and met with him in Rio de Janeiro last summer as part of a routine visit.",-1.0
"EU Officials Increasingly Fear a Marine Le Pen Upset in France. This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,    politicians: Marine Le Pen of France, and Brexit champion Nigel Farage of Britain (AFP) Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s   Front National party is still considered to be a very long shot to become the next president of France, but it is no longer considered an impossibility, mainly because of three factors: the unexpected passage of the Brexit referendum in Britain last year, the unexpected election of Donald Trump in the US last year, and a trend of rising nationalistic political parties in countries across Europe in recent years. The first round of the presidential elections will be held on Sunday, April 23. There are 11 candidates, so it is almost impossible for anyone to win by getting over 50% of the vote. The top two candidates will then take part in a runoff election on May 7, to determine the final winner. President François Hollande, a Socialist, has had abysmal popularity ratings and so has chosen not to run for a second term, a decision unprecedented in modern times. The polls put the top four candidates at around 20% each. Emmanuel Macron is the youngest, a    former investment banker, and former economy minister under Hollande. He is considered to be the favorite among the mainstream “globalist” European politicians. The early favorite was Republican François Fillon, but his support has crashed because of a scandal where he allegedly arranged for his wife to receive a large salary for a job that required little or no work.   Mélenchon is the   candidate, a kind of political mirror image of Marine Le Pen, though not entirely. Le Pen is   while Mélenchon is   but the two candidates do agree on one important issue: Neither of them likes the euro currency. Although Le Pen could flame out in the first round, it is widely expected that she will be one of the two leading candidates. Mainstream politicians are hoping a second round matching Le Pen with Macron. In that case, it is expected that Macron pick up voters from the candidates that have dropped out, while Le Pen’s core group of supporters would stay the same, with the result that Macron would defeat Le Pen by a wide margin. The scenario that most fear is that in the first round on Sunday, the two winners would be the two extremes, the   Le Pen and the   Mélenchon. This would be considered a disaster for the eurozone, as either one would like to return to the original French franc currency. After last year’s unexpected Brexit and Trump victories, there’s a great deal of anxiety among European politicians who fear that anything could happened. BBC and Market Pulse and Foreign Policy and Euro News and Daily Signal, Marine Le Pen is the current leader of the Front National party, which had a strong history of   under its previous leader and founder, Marine Le Pen’s father,   Le Pen, a Holocaust denier. At some point, she came to the conclusion that she and the Front National party could not become successful without completely breaking its   past. She did so by breaking with her father and banning him from the party. She has not repeated any of her father’s   remarks and has even condemned them. But in interviews, she is always asked about Jewish issues, and her answers are always heavily scrutinized by a mainstream press that is as consumed with hostility to her as with Donald Trump. One of the most controversial examples occurred in a recent interview where she insisted that France was not responsible for a July 1942 atrocity known as “Vel d’Hiv,” where French officials rounded up 13, 000 Jews and turned them over to the Nazis to be deported to Auschwitz. She had scrambled to explain that the “real” French government at that time was in exile, while the perpetrators of the atrocity were the puppet government in Paris under Nazi control. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, there are two important things to be noted here, things that I’ve written about many times. First, nationalism and xenophobia do not come from the politicians. They come from the people. If Marine Le Pen had not stepped forward to represent   and possibly   voters, then someone else would have done so, because the people were demanding it. What a politician can do is represent nationalistic and xenophobic voters, but then do everything possible to ameliorate the worst abuses of those attitudes. As I’ve noted in the past, Donald Trump has backed off from his early remarks Mexicans and Muslims, and appears to have adopted a course that takes into account the anxieties of his supporters, while preventing any abuses from taking place. Theresa May in Britain is similarly trying to chart a course that accommodates Brexit supporters, while avoiding total disaster for Britain’s economy. The second important point is that nationalism and xenophobia are growing around the world. Whether it’s Chinese vs Japanese, Chinese vs Vietnamese, Buddhists vs Rohingyas in Myanmar, Hindus vs Muslims in Kashmir, or Sunnis vs Shias in the Mideast, nationalism and xenophobia have been growing around the world, in one country after another. This is what always happens in a generational Crisis era, and it always leads to major wars or world wars. The Local (France) and Books and Ideas and Atlantic and News Max, The phrase “European Project” refers to the efforts, begun in the 1950s, to take steps to prevent another massive war in Europe. It’s hard today to remember the mood of the public in those days. Here’s what Hannah Arendt wrote in her 1950 book, The Origins of Totalitarianism: Two world wars in one generation, separated by an uninterrupted chain of local wars and revolutions, followed by no peace treaty for the vanquished and no respite for the victor, have ended in the anticipation of a third World War between the two remaining world powers [America and the Soviet Union]. This moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after all hopes have died. We no longer hope for an eventual restoration of the old world order with all its traditions, or for the reintegration of the masses of five continents who have been thrown into a chaos produced by the violence of wars and revolutions and the growing decay of all that has still been spared. Under the most diverse conditions and disparate circumstances, we watch the development of the same phenomena  —   homelessness on an unprecedented scale, rootlessness to an unprecedented depth. Never has our future been more unpredictable, never have we depended so much on political forces that cannot be trusted to follow the rules of common sense and    —   forces that look like sheer insanity, if judged by the standards of other centuries. It is as though mankind had divided itself between those who believe in human omnipotence (who think that everything is possible if one knows how to organize masses for it) and those for whom powerlessness has become the major experience of their lives. The purpose of the European Project was to prove that mankind was not completely powerless after all. If Europe could set up a new world order that would prevent the “sheer insanity” of another world war, then the European Project would succeed. This lead to the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and eventually to the formation of the European Union. What we see today is huge centrifugal forces pulling the European Project apart. Whether it is the Brexit referendum in Britain, Marine Le Pen in France, the “True Finns” in Finland, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany, the Golden Dawn party in Greece, the Jobbik party in Hungary, or any of the nationalistic movements in other European countries, what’s become clear is that people, particularly young people, have no fear or concerns about the lessons learned in World War II. This is what Generational Dynamics tells us always happens. In the last century, there were two world wars that destroyed Europe. The first World War was also devastating for Russia and the Mideast, while the second World War was also devastating for Japan and the Pacific. However, there were other massive wars in the last century, in Asia, in Africa, in the Americas. These wars of the last century are not well remembered by Americans, since Americans were not as heavily involved, but they’re well remembered by the people of the countries that fought in them. And that is just the last century. If you look at the earlier centuries  —   the 1800s, the 1700s, the 1600s, the 1500s, and so forth  —   there were also massive wars in Asia, Europe, the Mideast, Africa and the Americas in those centuries as well. No century has ever escaped this. The point is that these huge, massive wars have not yet begun to occur in this century, and so people, especially young people, have come to believe that they never will. And yet, there is absolutely no hope of avoiding them. Anyone can see that the world has become increasingly unstable in the last 10 or 15 years and that countries around the world have become increasingly nationalistic and xenophobic. It’s like the world is a pressure cooker, ready to explode. France enjoyed “La Belle Époque” starting in 1871, with advances in the arts rather than wars. That was the “Old World Order” that Hannah Arendt was talking about in the quote above. And yet, World War I exploded in 1914 completely without warning, when a high school student decided to shoot an Archduke of another country. From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, Hannah Arendt was right  —   that powerlessness is the major experience of our lives. Politicians are powerless to stop the flow of generations, as young, foolish generations displace older, traumatized, experienced generations, and repeat all the mistakes of the past, once again, over and over.

"Overnight Healthcare: Freedom Caucus open to new ObamaCare replacement plan | TheHill. Rep. David Brat said Tuesday that a new ObamaCare replacement plan from Rep. Mark Sanford is being viewed favorably by the conservative Freedom Caucus. While the caucus hasn't taken a formal position on the bill, Brat said it is widely liked by its members. Brat said Sanford's bill is similar to one introduced by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) Sanford's bill has not yet been officially introduced. Paul's plan includes a tax credit of up to $5,000 per person to use as part of a Health Savings Account to pay for medical care. That tax credit appears to be larger than those offered in other Republican healthcare plans. The plan would abolish many of the central elements of ObamaCare, including the mandate that everyone has coverage. It would also eliminate the minimum standards for which health services an insurance plan must cover. Republicans argue that change would allow for cheaper, less comprehensive plans.

The Department of Health and Human Services is in the process of putting forward a regulation on ""stabilization"" of the ObamaCare marketplaces, and The Huffington Post reported on Monday that one proposal in the regulation is to change the ratio set out under ObamaCare on how much more insurers can charge older people compared to younger people. The Huffington Post reported that the Trump administration is considering a regulation to change the ratio to 3.49:1, under the theory that 3.49 still ""rounds down"" to three and therefore follows the law. But the AARP, which opposes efforts to allow insurers to charge older people more, says such a move would violate the clear text of the Affordable Care Act, and would consider suing to stop the change.

"Alibaba Posts Robust Revenue Growth Despite China’s Slowing Economy – TechCrunch. Alibaba posted strong quarterly earnings today, with revenue jumping 32 percent as shoppers spent more money on the e-commerce company’s mobile sites and apps. Chief executive officer Daniel Zhang said during Alibaba’s earnings call that China’s expanding middle class is driving the company’s growth. In particular, younger people who have “little interest in saving compared to their parents” and see online shopping for trendy items as a pastime will not only boost revenue in the future, but also generate valuable data for advertisers on Alibaba’s sites. Other growth drivers include rural development, which means merchants in cities will have a larger potential customer base, while farmers in return can use Alibaba’s platform and logistics to sell their harvest to urban dwellers. Cross-border commerce, or international brands selling goods to Chinese consumers, is also doing well and drove sales on Single’s Day (the Chinese equivalent of Black Friday) to record levels in November. Despite continuing concerns about the slowing Chinese economy, Alibaba’s vice chairman Joseph Tsai sounded an optimistic note during its earnings call: “The Chinese economy is going through a structural shift from high growth to more moderate, but sustainable growth.” The company posted total revenue of 34.54 billion RMB (about $5.3 billion). Revenue from its retail marketplaces was 28.7 billion RMB ($4.4 billion) a 35 percent increase, while mobile revenue jumped a strong 192 percent to 18.7 billion RMB ($2.9 billion). Gross merchandise volume rose 23 year-over-year percent to 964 billion RMB ($149 billion), with sales from Alibaba’s mobile platform making up 68 percent of that amount. Despite Alibaba’s strong revenue growth, its GMV still lagged behind the 28 percent growth posted last quarter. Koubei, the online-to-offline marketplace that Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Financial plowed almost $1 billion into last summer, made 15.8 billion RMB ($2.4 billion) during the quarter. Its growth will be closely watched as Alibaba and rivals like Tencent invest large amounts of money on their O2O strategies. Aliyun, Alibaba’s cloud computing unit, made 819 million RMB in revenue ($126 million), up 126 percent from a year ago.",0.0
"Franken: Voters Should Be Mad At Republicans for Obamacare - Breitbart. Thursday on CNN’s “The Lead,” while discussing the increasing costs of the Affordable Care Act referred to as Obamacare, Sen.

"Trump And India’s Modi Share Similarities, But A Host Of Issues Divides Them. As India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in the U. S. over the weekend, President Trump tweeted a warm welcome, calling the Indian leader ”a true friend.” The two are meeting for the first time at the White House Monday afternoon, Modi having arrived for a brief,   call  —   not a state visit, but a working one. Perhaps that’s fitting, as there is so much in the relationship to work on. A host of issues now divides the two leaders, including the Paris climate change agreement, which Modi supports and Trump rejects, and the treatment of Iran as a pariah state, which Trump supports and Modi rejects. India wants the U. S. to ensure visas for its skilled workers, including IT engineers. But Trump says the visas have been misused and undermine jobs for Americans. Perhaps the most important outcome of their meeting will be putting to rest the notion that the U. S.  relationship is adrift. Maya Mirchandani, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank, says the fact it has taken until now for Trump to sit down with Modi has prompted anxiety in India that New Delhi is no longer a priority in the Oval Office. ”We have seen both President Bush and President Obama give India a sense of primacy that’s been missing in the last six months,” Mirchandani said. ”That’s something [both sides] might hope to correct.” Sounding a reassuring note, a senior White House official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity said the Trump administration is interested in maintaining the same ”strategic partnership” India enjoyed under the Obama administration, when the reserved Obama and the more casual Modi hit it off so well they were dubbed the ”odd couple.” But the Trump administration has yet to articulate an overall South Asia policy. There is no U. S. ambassador in New Delhi (though White House aide Kenneth Juster is reported as a likely candidate to fill the slot) and no assistant secretary is in place for South Asian affairs at the State Department  —   diplomatic absences that cannot help but cause even more unease in New Delhi. Defense ties are strengthening, though, as the U. S. is poised to sell more arms to India. In the last decade, it’s sold $15 billion worth of weaponry to New Delhi, according to the senior White House official who briefed reporters on the visit. Modernizing India’s defenses will strengthen both countries, she said. The same could be said for the thousands of Indians studying in the United States, whose talents can benefit both countries. Modi has called India’s relationship with the U. S. ”  and diverse,” noting it extends well beyond    and said he looked forward to an ”  exchange of views” with President Trump to ”consolidate” the ”  partnership.” But the Indian leader’s visit comes at an inopportune time, as the president and his team are distracted by domestic political and legal challenges. The voluble Modi will be in listening mode, says Shyam Saran, India’s former foreign secretary  —   eager to hear the president’s world view, especially on China, and where India fits into Trump’s evolving Asia policy. Trump already ”has had a very important meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. What is his sense of how  . S. relations will develop?” asks Saran. ”We also see the need for there being a role for India to perform,” he adds. ”After all, we have a certain interest, common interest, in having a more balanced architecture in the   region.” Modi will also be keen to know more about Trump’s policy in the Middle East, especially in the wake of recent Saudi and Gulf state moves against Qatar for its alleged support of terrorists. With millions of Indian citizens working in Gulf countries, India watches developments like this with alarm. In the thicket of diplomacy, Modi must also to try to grasp an unpredictable U. S. president who derides China as a ”currency manipulator” one day, but later calls President Xi ”a great guy.” ”What is really disconcerting in New Delhi is what you get on Monday is not necessarily what you get on Tuesday,” says Milan Vaishnav, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D. C. ”This kind of   turn is very concerning to India.” Vaishnav says Modi’s priorities include making progress on proposed new U. S. visa restrictions that could affect the status of India’s skilled workers  —   and correct the record on climate change. When President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, he said India had predicated its participation on receiving ”billions and billions and billions of dollars of foreign aid,” a remark that incensed New Delhi, where leaders said it was patently untrue. The competing visions of the two leaders  —   both inspired by nationalist impulses  —   may be the most significant hurdle for smooth relations. The two men rose to office by appealing to majorities who felt persecuted or overlooked  —   fundamentalist Hindus in Modi’s case, and aggrieved white voters in Trump’s. Modi wants to turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse and enlist American businesses to create jobs that would lift millions of Indians from poverty. Trump wants to keep American businesses and jobs at home. While both men are pragmatic   Vaishnav wonders whether Trump’s ”America First” policy can be flexible enough to accommodate India and its need to grow. ”I think we’ve now come to a fork in the road, and it’s not clear which way we are going to go,” he says. For all their differences, though, Trump and Modi share key traits: They positioned themselves as outsiders and rose to the pinnacle of an insider’s game. They brook no criticism and believe in personal diplomacy. Both are large personalities with a penchant for surprise and a deep disdain for the media  —   unless they’re using it to further their own ends. Trump and Modi are the two elected leaders with the most followers on Twitter, and both leapfrogged over the mainstream media in their rise to power. Mirchandani expects this is one area in which the two will find common ground. ”They will certainly see eye to eye,” she says, ”on making a mockery of the media.”",-0.5
"Cramer: Left-for-dead industrials suddenly back. Industrial stocks have been the big ugly ducklings of the stock market for ages. And if anyone would have told Jim Cramer 48 hours ago that a company would take a run at $75 billion United Technologies, he would have thought that was insane. But it happened, and it was a big wake-up call for Cramer. Stocks sank on Tuesday after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank has $44 billion in direct loan exposure to oil and gas, which put a new spin on the negatives of lower oil and gas prices. ""I didn't like anything about this discussion. JPMorgan reported a little more than a month ago. Why didn't they say something then? It's not like oil wasn't low in January,"" the ""Mad Money "" host said. With oil and bank stocks hated badly in the market, Cramer was intrigued by industrials. When CNBC's David Faber broke news of a possible merger between Honeywell and United Technologies on Monday, it prompted Cramer to take a fresh look at the cohort. The combination of the two companies would create a domination in two huge industries: aircraft and heating ventilation, and air conditioning. The possible acquisition highlighted to Cramer that there is still life in the industrial sector if further merger and acquisition activity were to occur, which he found compelling. Cramer Remix: Honeywell triggered a major trend Cramer: Bernie Sanders 'buried alive', boosts stocks Cramer: Low $30s is the magic price for oil ""No, I am not a fan of Caterpillar … but wait a second, if some company were big enough to take a run at this $38 billion behemoth that sells at almost half that it did not that long ago, doing so with a long view, I can see how that deal would make sense, "" Cramer said. Cramer speculated that he would not be surprised if talks surfaced surrounding companies such as Eaton, Cummins, Deere and Alcoa. This might seem like a tall order, but Cramer is willing to consider that the industrials could make a turnaround. ""After the Honeywell-United Tech revelations, I think this market could suddenly get more positive on the once-shunned now-compelling on-the-way-down industrials that we had left for dead and buried under a Chinese wall just a few weeks ago,"" Cramer said.

"Rio Olympics–America’s First Gold Medal: A Good Girl with a Gun - Breitbart. The US won its first gold medal in the 2016 Rio Olympics when   Virginia “Ginny” Thrasher —  a good girl with a gun —  beat out Chinese Olympians in the 10mm air rifle competition. [Thrasher beat Chinese shooters Li Du and Yi Siling. It was Yi who won Gold in the 10mm air rifle event at London in 2012.  The Sun reports that “a horde of Chinese fans and journalists had gathered in the hope of seeing their country take the opening event of the Olympics, just as it had done in London. ” And while Yi managed to lead early on, then stumbled because of some “poor shots. ” Thrasher turned it on and “never looked back after hitting the front for the second time after the 11th of 20 shots in the final. ” According to Yahoo Sports, Thrasher became interesting in shooting competitions via “a family hunting trip five years ago. ” The event in which she won gold is the first “international shooting competition” in which she has taken part.

"G.O.P., Once Unified Against Obama, Struggles for Consensus Under Trump - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   Whenever a major conservative plan in Washington has collapsed, blame has usually been fairly easy to pin on the Republican   who insist on purity over practicality. But as Republicans sifted through the detritus of their failed effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, they were finding fault almost everywhere they looked. President Trump, posting on Twitter on Sunday, saw multiple culprits, including the renegade group of   conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and outside groups like the Club for Growth. Those groups, which do not always work placidly together, had aligned against the president and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the ultimate symbol of their dismay with the entrenched ways of the capital. At the same time, some saw the president as pointing a finger at Mr. Ryan when Mr. Trump urged his Twitter followers on Saturday to tune in to a Fox News host, Jeanine Pirro, who went on to call for Mr. Ryan’s resignation. For eight years, those divisions were often masked by Republicans’ shared antipathy toward President Barack Obama. Now, as the party struggles to adjust to the   political order, it is facing a nagging question: How do you hold together when the man who unified you in opposition is no longer around? Mr. Obama provided conservatives with not just a health law to loathe and a veto pen to blame, but also a visage that allowed their opposition to be more palpable. “With Obama no longer being there, the emotional element of the opposition is drained away,” said Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review. Republicans also have to contend with an outsider president who never had much of an affinity or loyalty for their party, and who, as a novice politician, has not built the relationships in Washington that are usually needed to get big deals done. “There’s this disjunction,” Mr. Lowry added. “He doesn’t have a congressional party. He doesn’t even really have a wing of a congressional party. ” In the health care fight, it was not just the far right, egged on by   outside groups, that split from the Republican leadership. There were dissenters among the more     conservative lawmakers, those representing suburban communities outside Philadelphia and Washington and rural states like Louisiana. Even party leaders like Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, opposed the bill. Interest groups on the right were also divided, with natural allies like Americans for Tax Reform, the   outfit, and Americans for Prosperity, a   group backed by the Koch brothers, on opposing sides. While Republicans often said they would deliver freedom and good fortune if given their turn at the wheel, they are now jolted by the realization that their struggles to reach a consensus have thrown into doubt whether they can reach deals on other priorities like a tax overhaul, infrastructure, trade and immigration. “It is a challenge for the modern Republican Party and the Trump administration to figure out how to get to 218 on a regular basis,” said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who supported the Republican health care bill that failed last week. Generally, 218 is the number of votes needed to pass legislation in the House. Mr. Norquist said the desire for sweeping change had distorted some conservatives’ perceptions about what could be achieved and how quickly. “They want to change the rules,” he added. “But until you actually change the rules, they’re there, and you have to live by them. ” In a sign of just how deeply this episode has shaken the conservative faction of the party, one of the Freedom Caucus’s members resigned in protest on Sunday, saying he no longer believed the group was effective. “Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,” said the lawmaker, Representative Ted Poe of Texas. What makes progress on any issue so complicated is the fundamental clash between the belief systems of Mr. Trump, whose instincts are more populist than conservative, and Republican leaders in Congress, who are more oriented toward a     policy vision. “Trump, whatever else he is, was able to see that what was being offered to Republicans was not really what they wanted,” said David Frum, the conservative writer and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. “They wanted more health care for themselves, less immigration and no more Bushes. And what they were offered was no more health care, more immigration and a third Bush. ” The Trump administration wants to focus next on a tax overhaul. And on that Mr. Trump will probably find agreement with the Republicans in Congress. But crafting a plan that pleases most conservatives will not be simple. They remain split on some crucial details, like taxing imports. Some in the party, like Mr. Ryan, have favored such a plan, while others, like the   political advocacy groups, argue that it could set off trade wars and drive up manufacturing costs. Speaking to the dismay among many on the right after the health care fight, Ann Coulter, the writer and pundit, attacked Mr. Ryan for pursuing “standard G. O. P. corporatist stuff. ” “What made Donald Trump stand apart from the crowd, and apart from the crowd from every presidential candidate for 20 years,” she said on Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” “was immigration, trade, infrastructure, building a wall. Obviously, that was very, very popular. ” As for Mr. Trump’s Twitter post on Saturday, a White House official said that it and Ms. Pirro’s attack on Mr. Ryan were a coincidence, but the president has been pressed by some advisers to consider Mr. Ryan’s role in the health care defeat. How Republicans resolve issues of debt and deficit spending also loom as tripwires to the kind of legislative progress Mr. Trump craves  —   especially after a rocky start to his presidency. These issues, which Mr. Ryan and many other Republicans have been waiting eagerly to tackle since they took power, are not especially important to Mr. Trump, who is more focused on the kinds of projects that are natural to him as a developer, like infrastructure. And esoteric debates over deficit spending will not matter nearly as much to voters as how their personal finances look. “When he goes back to Rochester in a   campaign, he can’t talk about what’s changed in the deficit  —   no one will care,” said Frank Cannon, a longtime conservative activist. “But if he can talk about labor rate participation, jobs, jobs that are paying more, that’s what he’ll be judged on. And that’s what Republicans are going to live and die by in the next election cycles as long as he’s president of the United States. ”",-1.0
"Iran’s ’Military-Religious Amusement Park’ Lets Kids Practice Attacks on Israel. The Middle East Media Research Institute has published a translation of an interview from late September in which Child and the Future Cultural Center director Hamid Sadeghi talked about Iran’s new City of Games for Revolutionary Children Park. [The center is an “amusement park” in which children from 8 to 13 years of age pretend they are soldiers fighting all of Iran’s enemies: the Islamic State, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States.  Sadeghi was interviewed by a media outlet called Raja News, which MEMRI describes as “close to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. ” The way he described the park made it sound more like a carnival exhibit, which ran for a few weeks in September, with an option to extend the engagement if it was popular. He claimed the program, offered free of charge to children in the target age group, “has been in great demand. ” “At the City of Games, we are trying to convey to the children messages about fighting, the Holy Defense and current global issues, through games, amusements, and group activities,” Sadeghi explained. MEMRI notes that “Holy Defense” refers to the   War, which lasted for most of the 1980s, and killed up to a million people on both sides. Sadeghi said the experience began with “cultural experts” teaching some Shiite theology to the children, including the appointment of the Imam Ali as successor to Mohammed and the first “caliph,” which is the key doctrinal difference between Shia and Sunni Islam. The children, dressed in military uniforms, were then sent through various activities “simulating fighting the enemy” and learning simple combat techniques, such as “firing plastic artillery shells at a simulated enemy, as well as aiming and firing a rifle with plastic bullets at Netanyahu and at U. S. and Israeli flags. ” In other words, Iran’s government taught its children to shoot plastic bullets at an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In later drills, they threw balls at “effigies of ISIS and the Saudi royal family. ” After swallowing a hefty dose of propaganda about Iran’s glorious victory in the   War, the children were shown what it is like to fight ISIS in Syria, including the defense of the Shrine of Zaynab mosque, which is located in Damascus and holds the remains of Mohammed’s granddaughter, according to Shiite tradition. This segment of the tour involved   recreations of fairly realistic military drills, such as crawling through fire zones, penetrating barbed wire fences, and using sandbags for cover. The kids also played a word game that involved “finding bullets, each of which have a single letter written on it,” and using the bullets to spell out words and sentences. The final exercise was meant to teach children that “the most important elements for attaining victory are wisdom and intelligence for fighting the enemy. ” To this end, the children were “blindfolded and asked to throw a ball at an Israeli flag in the form of a puzzle and knock it down, and then to assemble a puzzle of an Iranian flag. ”",1.0
