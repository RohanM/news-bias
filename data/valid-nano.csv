"‘The Jinx’ director launches killer movie-making app. Life is a documentary  —   and all you need is a smartphone to shoot it. That’s the pitch from    director Andrew Jarecki who, less than a year after airing his acclaimed HBO series “The Jinx” about accused   Robert Durst, is launching a mobile app called KnowMe that enables users to create and share polished, edited videos on the fly. The free app  —   whose backers include “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” director J. J. Abrams  —   allows users to shoot and string together video segments and photos using their phone’s library. They can also pull videos, images and music from the Web to enhance the final cut. “What we’re eliminating is the bad part of filmmaking,” Jarecki told The Post. “If there’s anything revolutionary here, it’s letting people take all their recent media and edit it as they go. ” Hollywood stars who have created   with KnowMe’s beta version in recent months include Mike Myers, and  . Jarecki pegs KnowMe’s    features somewhere between those of Snapchat, which allows no choosing or editing of videos and photos, and those of      suites. Stills and sequences can be arranged and rearranged by dragging them around like wiggling apps on a home screen, making for an editing process that can be nearly as quick as shooting the footage. Voiceovers are added by speaking while touching and holding thumbnail images of what you’ve shot, and music soundtracks can be easily loaded up and layered in.  All of this is not to say, however, that KnowMe is being aimed mainly at budding film auteurs. Jarecki says his New   startup, which now has 20 employees, sees a whole range of possible uses, including enhancing job applications, listing apartment shares on Airbnb, or even auditioning for a rock band. Dating is another possible use for KnowMe’s   platform, Jarecki notes. There are no immediate plans for   functions such as   toggle switches. Still, he expects the app will host thousands of searchable profiles and video creations soon after its Thursday launch. “I don’t think about it as a dating app so much as a ‘knowing app,’” Jarecki says. A   KnowMe video has the potential to be a vastly superior way of getting and vetting a prospective date than the comparatively primitive, static forms on dating apps like Tinder, he argues. “It’s eliminating ‘stranger danger,’” the filmmaker adds, branding a challenge faced by apartment renters, aspiring rock stars and college recruiters alike. All of them, he says, are hungry to find clues wherever they can  —   in strangers’ voices, mannerisms, houses and dogs. “It’s kind of incredible that in 2016, if I want to meet someone online I’m doing that through a photograph and a line of text,” Jarecki said.",1.0
"Can a New Political Talk Show Be Relevant Anymore?. In an early snippet from comedian Sarah Silverman’s new topical series, I Love You, America, her father unwittingly gives the show the perfect logline. ""Who gives a shit when the universe came,"" he says during a riff on Jews, parenting, and the banality of creationism, ""it’s here! What a stupid fucking question."" Silverman herself has described the show, which premieres today on Hulu, as “aggressively dumb.” In contrast to Jon Stewart-era The Daily Show or HBO’s Last Week Tonight, I Love You, America aims to expose our national curiosities by turning issues like mass incarceration and global warming into discussions, not dissertations. ""I want people’s defenses to go down so that we can connect,"" Silverman told Vulture. ""Any political discussion is stuffed in a very bready sandwich of the aggressively silly."" Through a mix of field pieces and in-studio interviews, Silverman wants to connect ""un-like-minded people"" and demonstrate just how similar we are by not taking sides, a tough gamble given the current constellation of late night political talk shows happily trafficking in partisan agendas. Speaking about the series, producer Adam McKay said he wants to see the country “get back to a grounded place where we’re not looking at right versus left, but corruption versus honesty."" But will it work? The polarizing effects of the Trump administration have only heightened the stakes for political talk shows, many of which find themselves at a crossroads. It’s a genre of television that’s no longer as revelatory as it once was. Under the president, the only consistency is the vagary of truth—up is down, and down is, well, a matter of perspective. And while a single-mindedly slanted talk show can run the risk of feeling dogmatic and intellectually deficient, one without a perspective or clear thesis is just as hazardous. Similar to I Love You, America, Comedy Central’s latest entry in the category, The Opposition with Jordan Klepper, is also trying to navigate that bind, albeit with a decidedly different approach. The show emerges from the shadow of The Colbert Report and operates as a parody of conservative cable news programs; Klepper’s contrarian persona “Jordan Klepper” is a farcical but less combustible version of Alex Jones, the blustering conservative Infowars host and conspiracy theorist. For years Stephen Colbert was the model avatar for this brand of characterized pundit speak: cantankerous, illogically hilarious, exceedingly confident, and never quick to back down—it was like watching a wittier, more high-brow Bill O’Reilly pick apart the people-first evangelism of liberal DC. During The Colbert Report’s run, from 2005 to 2014, the hypocrisies that fermented out of Fox News and homogenous conservative media were obvious and embarrassing. President Obama and his dare-to-dream progressivism was an easy target. “Fake news” had yet to become a political buzzword used to discredit even the most reputable media organizations. Facts still held value and the truth was not so easily warped to dangerous ends. With Trump’s election, the evils have become much more indistinct—and Klepper wields these incongruities to his advantage. ""May you only hear from others what you’ve already been telling yourself,"" he trumpeted to his studio audience during the premiere episode. “Jordan Klepper,” like “Stephen Colbert,” is a persona strictly quarantined to television; his views, though, live beyond the medium’s boundaries. They exist in the real world—with real, pernicious ramifications. Trump has been a great bullhorn in this regard: His presence has fueled a nationalist movement that provides platforms to people like Klepper’s TV counterpart, people who subscribe to culturally monolithic ideologies. But how funny does racism or the partitioning of women’s rights need to be? Must one be reminded of these horrors, night after night? At some point, a joke is no longer worth its consequence. In one early episode, the matter of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria became a contentious talking point. “When you’re drinking from a creek, it’s not a good news story,” San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz said in a news clip. Providing his own commentary, Klepper then suggested Cruz view the wreckage through the eyes of “someone who has a little bit of distance” from the situation, cuing up a series of tweets from Trump. One referenced local Puerto Rican officials and spewed with his signature flippancy: “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.” With an air of clownish seriousness, Klepper piled on. “Yes, you want everything to be done for you, like some privileged real estate developer’s son,” he prodded. “The president is doing the best he can.” 'Jordan Klepper,' like 'Stephen Colbert,' is a persona strictly quarantined to television; his views, though, live beyond the medium’s boundaries. They exist in the real world—with real, pernicious ramifications. The punchline, of course, was that Trump, progeny of a NYC real estate magnate, had not only done little to aide Puerto Rico’s stabilization, but had dismissed Maria’s aftermath next to that of Katrina, which he called ""a real catastrophe."" The show’s point was unmissable: it meant to enflame the ironies of untruth, to mock the huckster president and the circus of conservative news that heralds his non-accomplishments. There was just one problem with the segment—none of it was terribly humorous or more imaginatively profound than the penetrating analysis Colbert had perfected years prior. A talk show is often the victim of its own limits, be it Last Week Tonight’s single-topic framework that drags viewers down a rabbit hole of information or The Daily Show’s ""diluted point of view"" under Trevor Noah. This is especially true of late-night talk programs like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Late Night with Seth Meyers, which have veered deeply political in recent months. There’s typically a hit-or-miss opening monologue, condensed guest interviews devoid of real substance, and a closing musical act. It seems less surprising then that in stepping outside of their conventional hosting schtick, both Kimmel and Colbert, this time as himself on CBS’s The Late Show, have struck a chord with Americans, emerging as genuine political firebrands with their raw, humorless commentary on healthcare and gun control. Public discourse surrounding such thorny issues routinely ends with little policy reform, yet Kimmel has been able to center these discussions with lucidity and compassion. “I just want to, you know, laugh about things every night,” the host said in the wake of the Las Vegas mass shooting, which claimed 58 lives and left nearly 500 people injured. “But that, it seems to be becoming increasingly difficult lately. It feels like someone has opened a window into Hell.” There was no intended punchline, nor need for an exaggerated carnival act. Kimmel and the undecorated truth was more than enough. Perhaps, then, this is what Silverman hopes to reveal with I Love You, America—that plain-spoken sincerity from people across our colorful and complicated country can resonate beyond the humor, a kind of antidote for uneasy times.

"The X-Files’ biggest liability at this point is simple: creator Chris Carter.  Someone needs to save The   from itself. A   miniseries that aired in 2016 posted strong ratings (though they trended downward) and, as such, a new   miniseries will air in the   TV season. The core of the show is still strong. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are as terrific together as ever, and the 2016 miniseries even produced one incredibly strong installment in ”Mulder and Scully Meet the  .”    The problem is that even though the 2016 miniseries had its moments, fully half of it was an absolute disaster, with three episodes that served as reminders of why the show eventually left the air in the first place. The season premiere and finale both attempted to reinvent The  ’ alien conspiracy and only revealed how threadbare that whole story had become. Meanwhile, the fifth episode  —   ”Babylon”  —   was only saved by its status as a fascinating misfire, which tried to engender sympathy for Islamic terrorists and ended up doing roughly the opposite. And all three of those episodes have one big thing in common  —   they were written and directed by series creator Chris Carter, the man who’s been there every step of the way with this series and is coming back to shepherd the upcoming miniseries, but, nevertheless, must be stopped.    It wasn’t always like this!             Carter was never the strongest writer on his own show, but he was frequently at least a competent one in the show’s first several seasons. And his direction was often terrific, especially in the    comedy ”The   Prometheus” (season five) and ”Triangle” (season six) an episode that seems to consist of several very long, uninterrupted shots.    He’s also always been a tremendous ideas man. The very concept of The   is beautiful and elegant in its simplicity. It’s one of the great TV premises of all time, and it’s elastic enough to theoretically run forever. Even in the 2016 miniseries, you can see that Carter still has good ideas. Building the new conspiracy from the ruins of the old one was a potent way of commenting on the existence of The   as a miniseries, built atop the ruins of the old show. And his eye for casting remains strong: Robbie Amell and Lauren Ambrose as a sort of new Mulder and Scully duo were an inspired pairing.    But where Carter increasingly falls apart is in the execution of his good ideas. His writing has always trended toward the overly expository, but now exposition is all it is. His direction has fared better, but even in that he’s going through the motions. And while Amell and Ambrose were great actors for the roles they played, the roles themselves ended up being nothing to write home about. Even if you look back at Carter’s ’90s career, his best ideas usually emerged when others were helping steer the ship. The  ’ writers’ room was full of legendary scribes, while his   series, Millennium, was at its best in its second season, when Carter stepped back and Glen Morgan and James Wong took over. (Carter returned for Millennium’s third  —   and worst  —   season.) None of this means Carter’s work is without merit  —   after all, he created The  . But sometimes things get lost between his head and the screen, especially if nobody else is around to help channel his ideas into a form that makes sense as a story.    So the best approach here is simple: Let Carter do what he does best by coming up with ideas. Then, whenever possible, hire others to shepherd those ideas to the screen. A modest proposal for the future of The                Realistically, Chris Carter is never going to leave The   entirely. It’s his baby, and TV networks don’t usually like changing captains on a hit show, so long as showrunners are turning things in on time and on budget. Also, it’s highly unlikely that the alien conspiracy storyline will ever go away  —   even if it’s a horrible mess. But Carter probably shouldn’t be writing and directing fully half of any future   miniseries that happen. When the series was doing 22 to 25 episodes per season, Carter realistically couldn’t do that. However, with a much more relaxed shooting schedule on the recent miniseries, and presumably the upcoming one as well, he was able to, and that only further exposed some of the weaknesses in his work that have always been present. My proposal would be to let Carter stick around but hire someone to help him out as a sort of guardian of the conspiracy storyline (a role that writer Frank Spotnitz  —   who used to work on Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle  —   used to fill on the original series). ”Babylon” was terrible, but it was trying something big. As such, it was weird enough to make me think Carter might still strike gold now and then. Indeed, he mentioned at a press event I attended in early 2016 that he would love to do a musical episode, and that he has an idea for a bottle episode he’s never been able to pull off (one that I hope he figures out for the upcoming miniseries). And since I often like Carter in experimental mode, I don’t have a problem with him writing and directing an hour or two of whatever form The   takes next. But not half! Fortunately, with 10 episodes to fill this time around, Carter will almost certainly have to bring in more writers and directors than the skeleton crew that composed the miniseries. Even if he writes and directs three episodes again, there will be far more chances for the show to strike gold without him in a   season.    Obviously, he could just rehire the many illustrious writers who produced the original nine seasons  —   including Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul creator Vince Gilligan, for instance. But Carter has always had a tremendous eye for talent when it comes to writers, too. So why not do a season written half by the old guard and half by new writers  —   either established TV hands who love the show or brand new people that Carter recruits? There must be tons of writers out there who would be hungry for the chance. Wouldn’t you love to see an   episode written by Hannibal’s Bryan Fuller, or a take on the conspiracy from The Americans’ Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields? Wouldn’t it be interesting to explore what The   might look like if it were written by a woman, or a person of color, or someone barely in their 20s, who only knows the show from   it on Netflix? Carter, of all people, can find great writers who haven’t broken into the industry just yet, and if he gets to make more   he should try to further his greatest legacy: giving lots and lots of terrific writers their biggest break.

"Every ‘Breaking Bad’ fan should embrace ‘Better Call Saul’. Back in early 2015, I joined the chorus of TV fans lamenting the premiere of “Better Call Saul,” a prequel series starring Bob Odenkirk reprising his combed over,   character from “Breaking Bad,” which ended its scorching run just 17 months before. Sure, Odenkirk’s Saul Goodman was a charming, slippery chameleon, providing whatever comic relief managed to   into the pitch black world of “Breaking Bad. ” He was fun to watch, but he was a lateral character who couldn’t carry an entire series. Why not just let “Breaking Bad” rest in peace and move on? Enough already. I was wrong, and as “Better Call Saul” barrels toward its Season 3 finale Monday night it’s become one of my   series. It’s no “Breaking Bad,” but it has carved out its own unique universe (in familiar Albuquerque, no less) and has succeeded in making Saul Goodman (or Jimmy McGill, as he’s known here) a   person surrounded by equally interesting and colorful characters. It would be a creative injustice if Michael McKean, for instance, doesn’t get an Emmy nomination for his searing portrayal of Jimmy’s    brother, Chuck. His storyline this season has been compelling, particularly in his tense battles with Jimmy and with his smarmy law partner, Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian, equally terrific). And I like how the series has taken its time building its own world, holding back until this season on integrating those “Breaking Bad” characters both familiar (Gus Fring, Lydia, Hector) and arcane (hey, isn’t that Huell?) into its circa 2003 storyline. No Walter, Jesse or Hank  —   yet  —   but who knows? Maybe next season. “Every season we kind of go in and talk and come up with a basic road map, signposts for a general arc for what the season will be, and where we want to take the characters,” says “Better Call Saul” writer Gennifer Hutchison, who wrote Monday night’s season finale. “We try to build that organically as we go along. This season, for instance, we really wanted to escalate the relationship between Jimmy and Chuck and bring that to a head. “Each season it feels like we’ve brought more [‘Breaking Bad’] elements into the show as [the storyline] gets more and more complex,” says Hutchinson, who also wrote for “Breaking Bad. ” “We have so many continuity notes, a whole board with just characters’ names on it. There are ‘Breaking Bad’ connections that make sense now, like bringing Lydia back and, specifically, Mike’s storyline with Gus. There was always a plan to bring these characters back, but   …     it happens as we go along. It’s not like a flip is switched. ” Hutchison is asked what she can reveal about Monday night’s season finale (without spoiling anything). “There are definitely things that were set in motion that we do wrap up   …     that push you into the next chapter,” she says. “I look at this season as a season about consequences, some of which were set in motion in Season 1 and Season 2. “The [season] finale is a lot about that,” she says. “There are consequences for every character    actions taken and not taken  —   and now they have to pay that bill. ”",1.0
"How surprisingly upright rotation lets Yankees prospects simmer. The Yankees’ rotation was supposed to be the other one in town, the group that was going to need reinforcements sooner rather than later, the unit that looked like a YMCA fivesome compared to the   Mets quintet. Yet at the first major marker of a season  —   Memorial Day weekend  —   the Yankees’ starters have proven not only better than their Mets counterparts so far in 2017, but just as vital, healthier. Remember the narrative of spring was that both rotations were fragile, but the Mets   to make them more bulletproof. Except two months into the season, they already have had to go beyond the seven to Rafael Montero and Adam Wilk, and perhaps in the next few days to Tyler Pill or Josh Smoker. And the cascade of injury and inadequacy has had a spillover that has worn out the bullpen. Conversely, despite all the worries that the Yankees would be talking MRI as much as ERA this season, they are one of just four teams to use only five starters. That not only has provided stability, but as general manager Brian Cashman told me recently, “It is buying us time with development. ” He explained that pitchers such as Chance Adams, Justus Sheffield, Domingo German and Domingo Acevedo are gaining experience and refinement, and pushing closer to joining Chad Green, Bryan Mitchell and Luis Cessa as options when the inevitable need comes. They  —   and a group of positional prospects  —   also have performed well (besides Cessa) to gain further value as the Yankees approach the July 31 trade deadline, when the expectation is they still will try to add a starter if they believe they have a postseason chance. For the Yankees know the rotation’s best qualities have been steadiness and sturdiness, and the strength of the team has been the offense and bullpen. But the roles have reversed recently. The lineup has managed just 26 runs in the past nine games, and pretty much everyone in the bullpen not named Dellin Betances has shown a shakier side. Therefore, you can add timely to steady and sturdy in complementing a rotation that had been mostly   in the AL this year. For in the past six games  —   albeit three against the offensively challenged Royals  —   Yankees starters have pitched to a 1. 24 ERA. CC Sabathia triggered the excellence and added to it Saturday with 6   strong innings. Sabathia, because of his age (36) mileage and injury history, particularly to his knees, was perhaps the reddest member of the Yankees’   rotation in spring. But he actually leads the Yankees in innings and has just put together his first   winning streak (in which he has a 1. 50 ERA) since April 2013. He continued his morph from power to Pettitte by feeding cutters in on righties. But his changeup also was excellent and with a scouting report that revealed Oakland susceptibility at the top of the zone, the savvy lefty was more aggressive than normal with his   fastball. He averaged better than 91 mph with it, deploying the weapon as the finishing pitch on four of his nine strikeouts (his most since August of last year). This followed Masahiro Tanaka’s best start in a month, and what has been pretty consistently strong work from Michael Pineda and Luis Severino, and the continuing surprise that is Jordan Montgomery. All of them  —   because of youth   injury history  —   were a physical concern when the season began. But the subtle blessing is that no AL team has played fewer games than the Yankees’ 46. “The schedule has been very favorable,” manager Joe Girardi said. “We have not had to have guys go on their fifth day a lot. ” That is coming, of course, the realities of the   schedule assuring the rotation less breathers. Hence, greater stress on these starters, presaging a crack or three might develop that has yet to manifest. “You just can’t expect to get through a season using only five [starters],” Girardi said. Under the rosiest scenario, Tanaka, Pineda and Severino have the stuff to actually form a playoff front three, with Sabathia adding   and Montgomery an intriguing wild card. But there is a long way to the playoffs and the AL East is getting more claustrophobic top to bottom with Toronto and Boston, in particular, playing better. The Yankees’ rotation at least has created time for reinforcements to get through portions of their learning curves, position themselves better for the inescapable DL stints to come. But, so far, so good. The Yankees have the same five starters standing as June nears as when April began. On Memorial Day weekend, the Yankees have the healthiest, best rotation in town. Who saw that coming?",1.0
"Donald Trump’s Clinton attack speech reveals just how little he understands the world.  Donald Trump gave his first major speech of the election attacking Hillary Clinton on Wednesday morning. It mostly focused on labeling Clinton as corrupt, his stock ”Crooked Hillary” line expanded to an hour.    But it also tried to label Clinton as incompetent, blaming her personally for a series of events ranging from the decline of manufacturing jobs in the US to the rise of ISIS in Iraq. These policy arguments are pretty revealing  —   largely for what they say about Trump. In the speech, he takes a ridiculously narrow view of how the world works, assuming that if something in America or the world has gone wrong recently, it’s because of American policy  —   specifically, an American policy created by Hillary Clinton. His basic argument is that if a bad thing happened in the world and Hillary Clinton was alive during it, she’s the one who caused it. This goes beyond normal campaign rhetoric  —   it reveals a basic ignorance about the way the world works on Trump’s part. This speech is supposed to be the debut of ”serious Trump” after the past week’s disasters for his campaign. But it’s clear he still has no clue about the basic way American policy affects the world just months before he might be elected president.    Trump doesn’t seem to be aware of the Arab Spring             In 2011, the Middle East experienced a massive wave of protests that transformed regional politics. It toppled the Tunisian government and led to a temporary collapse in dictatorship in Egypt. Both the Libyan and Syrian governments decided to respond to the protests with violent repression, leading to civil wars in both countries and contributing to the rise of ISIS. You may have heard of this; it’s called the Arab Spring.    Yet according to Donald Trump, Clinton ”managed to almost singlehandedly destabilize the entire Middle East” during that time period. In Syria, it was Clinton  —   and not Bashar  ’s violent response to protesters  —   that kicked off a civil war: ”Hillary Clinton’s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen.” ISIS, too, is Clinton’s personal doing: ”ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.” Never mind the vacuum created by the civil war in Syria, or the Iraqi government’s decision to repress the Sunni minority, or the decision by regional players like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to shuffle arms to radical groups in Syria. It’s all Clinton’s fault, even though she wasn’t president.    Trump is going beyond blaming Clinton for mishandling the   crisis in the Middle East, which any Republican would do. Instead, he’s saying the entire crisis was her fault, as if the Arab Spring protesters were doing her nefarious bidding. Trump seems totally unaware of the reasons the Middle East is currently in crisis or America’s actual role in handling said crisis, a really breathtaking display of ignorance in a potential president. Trump, trade, and robots Trump’s ability to magically blame Clinton for bad things extends beyond the Middle East. He says that she, personally, is responsible for the decline of American manufacturing jobs in the United States.    ”Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself,” Trump said in the speech. ”Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton’s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization.” What actually destroyed US manufacturing was structural changes in the economy itself, not Hillary Clinton. In the past two decades, American manufacturing productivity has gone way up, due in significant part to automation and other   innovations. That means fewer people are needed to do work, which is why manufacturing employment has gone down in the past two years while the output of the US manufacturing sector has skyrocketed:            Trump, the famous businessman, either doesn’t know or doesn’t care about what’s actually driving this. In fairness to Trump, there is a reasonable case that US trade with China did cost a real amount of manufacturing jobs on top of the effects of automation. A famous paper by economists David Autor, Gordon Hanson, and David Dorn estimated that   trade cost about 1 million US jobs between 2000 and 2007. That was, you might note, during the George W. Bush administration. Yet according to the authors themselves, these job losses were going to happen pretty much no matter what the US did. China’s rapid growth and economic liberalization, beginning in the early 1980s, caused it to join the global economy. Once that happened, the architecture of the global trading system essentially guaranteed that the US would lose massive numbers of jobs in the manufacturing sector.    ”It was inevitable,” Hanson told me in an April interview. ”Once China became part of the global economy, what was going to happen was the US getting out of the really   stuff as China moved into that.” So Trump’s argument here is a   whammy of ignorance: ignorance both of the fundamental ways automation is changing the economy and of the way the global trading system actually works to deprive US workers of jobs. Trump seems to have an absurd faith in the power of US policy to singlehandedly change the character of the global economy. Why this matters            You might think I’m being unfair here  —   that all candidates blame stuff on their opponents unfairly. That’s true, to a degree. But Trump goes well beyond other politicians in just how ignorant he is of policy conditions. Here, for instance, is Bernie Sanders attacking Clinton’s Middle East policy in a December Democratic debate. The takeaway isn’t that different from Trump’s speech: Both men accuse Clinton of supporting interventions that destabilize the region. But Sanders correctly identified Clinton’s proposed solutions to the   spring crisis as the problem, without saying she’s responsible for the Arab Spring itself:  Yes, we could get rid of Qaddafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you’ve got to think about what happens the day after.  The point here is that Trump has a unique lack of understanding about the effect US policy has had on the world, one that relates to his fundamental ignorance about substantive issues. His policy attacks on Clinton sound bizarre because he genuinely doesn’t understand policy.  The political science that predicted Trump’s rise    ",-1.0
"Everything you were afraid to ask about white nationalism’s new place in American politics.   ’s 2016 word of the year might be fascism. For betting types making early 2017 predictions, “white nationalism” would not be a bad guess. Along with “white supremacy” and the newer phrase “alternative right,” or   it’s been a   fixture of news and accompanying battles over politics, racism, and language.     It started in earnest when it was announced that former Breitbart News editor Steve Bannon would serve as   Donald Trump’s administrative adviser. White nationalists like   writer and publisher Andrew Anglin rejoiced. Ken Reed, the national director of the   group Aryan Renaissance Society, celebrated in a Facebook post that read, “Can you say WINNING boys and girls? ??” using the hashtags #WhiteLivesMatter and #AltRight.  The     made even more headlines when the white supremacist National Policy Institute held an   conference in Washington, DC, the weekend after the election. There, the group’s leader, Richard Spencer, delivered remarks calling America “a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. ” In a video shared by the Atlantic, Trump’s victory and Spencer’s statements were cheered by the crowd with Nazi salutes and chants of, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!”  Yes, actual Nazi salutes. In a DC hotel. By people who felt Trump’s election and appointments were their victory.     Along with the horror over this came complaints that   activists were being referred to in many headlines with their chosen,   title, rather than something that made their racist agenda plain. Before long, the Associated Press and the New York Times issued strong guidance to their writers regarding the term. In both cases, they said uses of the  ’s preferred label must be accompanied by an explanation to readers about what defines the group: the racism, misogyny, and white supremacy that characterize it.     These news organizations’ memos have been clear mandates in a contentious, evolving public debate about how to characterize the groups and individuals who have been emboldened and empowered by Trump’s win and share one scary thing: an obsession with white power, influence, and identity.  At a time when unabashed racists are elated at the possibility that the   will take action to create the “white country” of their fantasies, and people who share their policy views but have no hate group affiliation are being empowered, the current battle of words is an important one. Fueling it is the risk that the wrong language choices could cloud Americans’ understanding of what’s actually happening. Complicating things is the sobering reality that the threats nonwhite people face don’t change depending on what we call the people responsible for them.      Why there are suddenly fights over how to describe racist views and groups  —   and why they have fresh relevance Unless you work for an organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the activity of hate groups, or are a scholar of critical race studies, “white supremacy” and “white nationalism” aren’t likely part of your daily vocabulary. Or at least they weren’t until Trump’s bold expressions of racism and xenophobia  —   and hints that he’d support policies that reflect these concepts  —   began to inspire groups that embrace these ideas, making them newly relevant. Just as people debate when and where the term “racist” can be fairly applied (hint: nowhere, without plenty of people protesting) it’s becoming obvious there won’t be easy agreement on who and what deserve these other labels. Even people who appear to be white supremacy’s proud poster children reject the label.  Hints of this battle over words first surfaced during the campaign season, when Trump received the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke  —   just one of the white nationalists and white supremacists who were elated and energized by Trump’s campaign. In fact, Mother Jones’s Josh Harkinson reported on the white extremist movements that hoped to capitalize on Trump’s victory. The week before the election, the front page of the KKK’s official newspaper displayed a raving embrace of his “Make America Great Again” message. Candidate Trump denounced the support of both Duke and the Klan, in a clear distancing from the negative associations with white supremacy.      But soon after Trump was declared the winner of the election, he appointed Bannon to be an administration adviser. Extremists like Anglin, the   writer, and commenters on his Daily Stormer post who celebrated Bannon’s reported   were pleased.  But there was a twist: Bannon insisted he was not a white nationalist but rather an “economic nationalist. ” Trump went even further, telling the New York Times that Bannon was neither racist nor “ . ” Another tug of war over labels followed when Spencer made it known that he wasn’t fond of the terms “racist,” “Nazi,” and “white supremacist” being applied to him. Instead, Spencer, who led the “Hail Trump!” Nazi salute and heads a group that promotes “America for white people,” told the Washington Post he prefers to be called an “identitarian”  —   a reference to a movement that has more momentum in Europe but all the same associations with racism and xenophobia.  In an effort to stop people like Spencer from allowing   labels to distract from their shocking (and, to people of color, deeply threatening) beliefs and goals, some   publications have announced that they’ll reject the “ ” term altogether. On November 27, ThinkProgress editors announced that people in this movement would not be labeled with their chosen descriptors but rather would be called “white nationalists” or “white supremacists. ”   Yet that same week, Mother Jones’s Kevin Drum urged progressives to go in the opposite direction: pulling back the use of the phrase “white supremacy,” which he dubbed a “fad,” as liberals use it “with more abandon than we should. ” Instead, he advised that the term should be reserved for people and institutions that “really deserve it,” and use “racist” in its place: “If something is racist,” he wrote, “then call it racist. ” Confused? You’re not alone. In this scramble to define and regulate the use of terminology in a new landscape of open calls for white power, the competing personal, political, journalistic, and ideological interests have created a kind of chaos.     The single thing everyone seems to agree on is that words matter  —   a lot.  White supremacy, white nationalism, and the  : Here’s what these terms mean and where they overlap  Let’s start with the broadest term, white supremacy, and its adjective form, “white supremacist. ” It has a powerful ring to it  —   probably because, unlike “” it creates associations with terrorist racist organizations that the majority of Americans have been taught to recognize as objectively bad.  Perhaps that’s why Drum argued that it should be used with caution and reserved for “actual   and a few others. ” Crystal Fleming, a sociology professor at Stony Brook University, says Drum’s proposed “  and a few others” standard is misguided, but not uncommon.  “It’s pretty easy to explain,” she told Vox. “The reality is that when folks hear the term ‘white supremacy’  —   the layperson and even the average scholar  —   they tend to think of the KKK. ”  That’s not what it means, she explained. The key difference is between “white supremacy” and “white supremacist. ” The latter refers to people who embrace the ideology of white superiority, but white supremacy  is more general: It simply describes “the sociopolitical dominance of people socially defined as white,” Fleming said.    In her view  —   and the view of critical race scholars  —   “white supremacy” just refers to the way people defined as white (which has shifted throughout the course of America’s history) have been allowed to have, and systematically have been given access to, more resources, whether those are political, economic, social, or all of the above.  In other words, she says it’s not an outrageous, overused slur but instead “a constant throughout history. ” If you have any doubts about that, consider Richard Spencer’s description of America again: “A white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. ” That’s basically, Fleming’s definition of white supremacy in different words. Given that a white supremacist and a black sociologist agree that the concept of white supremacy is foundational to America  —   and the former is working to make that more so  —   now would seem like an especially   time to pull back on using the phrase.  The next thing to understand is the relationship between white supremacists and white nationalists. While listing the words it will use while announcing recently that it would abandon the term “” ThinkProgress offered a distinction between the two: “White nationalist” refers to a specific ideology held by many of those who adopt the “ ” label. A white nationalist is someone who believes the United States should be governed by and for white people, and that national policy should radically advance white interests. White supremacists are a broader and more inchoate group, comprised of those who believe in the innate superiority of white people.  Sophie   a postdoctoral anthropology fellow at Vanderbilt University who studies contemporary white supremacist movements, distinguishes these groups of people similarly. Within white nationalism, a lot of people also have a specific goal: a white  . They’d contrast this with the ultimate aims of white supremacists, who want to have power over people of color within the same state, she told Vox.     Finally, the phrase that’s been the topic of the most debate  —   “ ”  —   is the name Spencer gave to a loose,   group linked by racist ideas about “white identity” and the preservation of “Western civilization” when he launched his Alternative Right blog in 2010 (more on this group’s beliefs later).  Finally, there’s “ . ” ThinkProgress’s editors also said the term can apply to any of these groups “when they identify as such, or adopt important aspects of Nazi rhetoric and iconography. ” According to   the National Policy Institute’s recent “hail Trump salute” incident isn’t the only reason many think the term “ ” is a good fit for the group. Like white nationalists as a whole, “many members of the     have decided that targeting Jews and ratcheting up   language is a strategy,” she said.  There’s a strong case that the phrase “ ” is the sneaky, dangerous rebranding work of white nationalists The label “ ” may be considered the latest attempt to create distance from racist groups and terms like “white supremacy” or even specific groups like the KKK. Those names and labels come with weighty, negative histories that have been generally rejected as destructive and immoral.  “White supremacists started to be called white nationalists by groups born out of old white citizens’ councils that were fighting desegregation the South, as a way to make their position of whites being better than any other race more politically palatable,” Ryan Lenz, the editor of the SPLC’s Hatewatch blog, told Vox.  Eventually, he says, “white nationalist” developed its own negative baggage. And while mainstream acceptance of their views may have dwindled since the civil rights era, the commitment of people holding these views  —   many of whom discovered them on the internet  —   to seeing them become reality did not. Next thing you knew, the   was born.  “Richard Spencer coined the phrase ‘alternative right’  —   a phrase that is so innocuous and so   that it gives the idea that it is simply one alternative to conservatism,” Lenz says. “It is not. ”    According to the SPLC, the name is one key part of a package that includes neat dressing and a   appearance. (“We have to look good,” Spencer once told Salon’s Lauren Fox, explaining that no one would want to join a movement that appeared “crazed or ugly or vicious or just stupid. ”) And they’re not alone in the belief that it’s all a dangerous effort to rebrand vile ideas about racial superiority and separatism as a legitimate part of the political spectrum.  “I am very passionate about this idea that we need to be very careful with that term,”   told Vox. “‘ ’ sounds much more palatable than ‘ ’  —   it is an attempt at reframing a violent ideology as a palatable political position. ”  Former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro told Vox’s Sean Illing in November that this branding is key to making the   appealing for the kind of people who are willing to support the group’s racist visions for the country once they’re in the door but would have hesitated to open that door if it said “white supremacy” in bold letters:  The next thing they have to do is obfuscate what the   actually is, so a lot of people think they’re   when they’re not. Rather than say the   is an explicitly white nationalist movement, they say, well, if you’re pissed off at the establishment, you’re probably  . If you’re somebody who lurks online, you’re probably  . If you don’t like Paul Ryan, if you think he’s soft, you’re probably  . And they trap a lot of people in this way. They also need what I call fellow travelers, people who are willing to nod and look the other way about the  ’s racism because they think the   is essentially correct about Western civilization being under assault. Someone like Pat Buchanan, for example, falls under this category.   ’s concern about the term “ ” is based on similar thinking: It creates the risk that more white people may become radicalized by the group. “If we help to normalize these ideas as just part of the political spectrum, then it can make it seem less radical than they are and less connected to racial violence  —   because if people espouse racist ideas and racial rhetoric, there’s always some kind of a correlation to racist violence,” she said. “And if we don’t describe them for what they are, we’re kind of giving other white people a path to think these are legitimate ideas and a chance that more white people will become radicalized in adopting these ideas. ” The nuanced difference between these groups matters to their members. To people of color who’d suffer under their agendas, not so much.  Most of the time, white nationalists don’t want to be called white supremacists. And many members of the   don’t want to be called white nationalists.     To be fair, they’re not being inaccurate when they point out that there are differences between the groups.  Vox’s Dylan Matthews’s   explainer on the   makes this clear. It was an incredibly detailed take on the diverse demographic, emotional, and philosophical ingredients that are baked into the   cake. Matthews outlined the group’s various factions  —   from libertarians to neoreactionaries to Gamergate guys  —   and quoted Milo Yiannopoulos, an   activist, saying that some   embrace racism for “shock value,” not because they’re actually bigots. With insider perspectives like this and many more, Matthews makes a compelling case that the group really is more than “  white supremacy” or “a simple rebranding of the white nationalist movement. ”  The New York Times’s Amanda Taub pointed out a similar distinction, explaining that what makes the   different from white nationalism is that many of its members’ first priorities and entrees into the group aren’t related to race. “The   is ideologically broader than white nationalism  —   it also includes neoreactionaries, monarchists, and   internet trolls,” she wrote.  So, yes, the   includes views and characters that fail to map perfectly onto say, your average KKK chapter.  But a key question is whether, and to whom, these differences matter.  The answer: Not at all, to people paying attention to the rising influence of racist hate in this country. Lenz told Vox that from his perch at the SPLC, “White supremacy, white nationalism, and the   are all the same thing. ”   similarly dismisses the distinctions between the three groups as “splitting hairs. ”     Why? Because for all intents and purposes, they share a vision for America. As Taub explained, “White supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy. ” And the   as a whole  —   whether we call its members white nationalists, white supremacists,   racists, the Gamergate gang, or some other new term  —   is quite clear that it’s enthusiastically behind this plan.  Ultimately, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp reported, the  ’s hope for the  ’s influence is “reducing the numbers and influence of African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, and Jews. ” Its members want Trump to follow through on the most extreme immigration ideas he’s discussed  —   such as deporting millions of undocumented immigrants and banning Muslim immigration. Their goal: slowing the “dispossession of America’s whites. ”  So while it may be true that there are variations (big ones, in some cases) in internal lives and personal identities among people who call themselves white supremacists, white nationalists, and members of the   it’s also true that these nuances mostly only matter to them  —   and perhaps to people taking a historic academic approach to understanding their individual textures. Meanwhile, for people concerned about their growing influence on American politics and increasing confidence  —   in particular for people of color who would be the victims of the policies they support  —   these differences have little to no practical significance.  Even the strongest argument the   makes for the case that it should be distinguished from white supremacists and white nationalists  —   that it doesn’t have a violent history  —   seems insincere in the eyes of experts. “They’ll seize upon this, arguing, ‘If you lump us in there with Klansmen, you’re trying to smear us by association,’” Lenz said.  But Stony Brook’s Fleming told Vox this indignation is for show, and that central to the  ’s attempt to mainstream white nationalism and racism is its tactic of going right up to the line of violence  —   but being careful not to explicitly endorse it. “There’s a lot of winking and denial,” she said. “They’re very astute with encouraging discrimination, violence, and bigotry but still hiding under the cover of, ‘We didn’t call for them to be lynched. ’” Not to mention that Spencer’s calls for peaceful rather than violent ethnic cleansing aren’t particularly reassuring or meaningful to the nonwhite and Jewish people who would stand to be eliminated from his ideal country. And you can read “not particularly” to mean “not at all. ”     “We have this movement from the KKK, which is a terrorist group in a multiracial society, to this new position of saying, ‘We just want to have a white ethnic state,’ but white supremacist ideas are clearly foundational to that,”   said. “Then [the  ] says the goal is not a race war, or violence, just a separate state. But the question is, in a multiracial state, how are you going to do that without violence?” Nobody knows the answer. One reason some are so insistent on slapping the “white supremacist” label on the    —   along with all the negative associations that come with it  —   is to make it less likely that we’ll ever have to find out.  You don’t have to wear a hood, do a Nazi salute, be an internet troll, or claim memberships in any of these groups to perpetuate racism and cause harm  With the increasing newsworthiness of these groups of people  —   white supremacists, white nationalists, and the    —   it’s important to remember that most people don’t have links to any of these groups, but many share their core beliefs.  “While few people identify as white nationalists, there is a continuum of views shared by many Americans that are explicitly hostile to people who aren’t     white Christians,” Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of political science at Princeton University, said. “In short, you don’t need to wear a white robe to feel, at a deep level, that America belongs to your community more than other citizens. ” Fleming added: “Organizations matter, but ideologies and practices I would argue matter more. Whether one is officially part of an org or not, you can look at folks’ records or statements and clearly see when they embrace policies that disadvantage or harm people of color. ”   says Trump’s attorney general pick, Sen. Jeff Sessions, is the perfect example: “There’s been all this attention to Bannon because of his work at Breitbart, but there’s also someone like Sessions who was deemed too racist 30 years ago to be a federal judge,” she said. “I haven’t seen anything that says he’s part of this movement [the  ] but at the same time it’s not like his potentially racist leanings are any less dangerous. ”    It’s no wonder Spencer told Mother Jones he was pleased with Sessions’s appointment, because labels don’t matter as much as ideas.  ”Jeff Sessions, again, is someone who is not   but who seems to see eye to eye with us on the immigration question. I think Jeff Sessions might very well resonate with something like a   dramatic slowdown of immigration,” he said. Spencer added, ”What he is not going to do in terms of federally prosecuting diversity and fair housing and so on I think is just as powerful as what he might do. So it’s about Jeff Sessions setting a new tone in Washington. I think that’s a good thing. ” In other words, someone who has no links to any racist organizations has still managed to be the politician of white supremacists’ dreams and the nightmares of people of color. Professional racists are emboldened, and those who aren’t associated with any group are in a position to make their racist goals seem realistic, SPLC’s Lenz says. “These are confusing and scary times. ” While there may not be much to do to calm these fears, insisting on precise language to describe them is a start.

"The Fascinating Art of Hollywood’s Made-Up Languages, From Dothraki to Klingon. If you ever want to find a bathroom on Vulcan or ask for dressage lessons in Essos, you’ll need to learn a constructed language first. ""Conlangs"", as they're known, are common in genre movies and literature, and through them, a viewer or reader can better appreciate what it would be like to approach an Arwen Evenstar lookalike at a bar or figure out whether Groot told you to turn right or left at the exploding flagship. But how, exactly, does one do that? Well, learning fictional tongues doesn't come easy, but as with any language, it's important to master the basics first. Luckily, dialect coach Erik Singer is here to help you distinguish a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative from a uvular plosive. In the video above, he explains the Earthly inspirations behind six of the most popular conlangs: Parseltongue (Harry Potter), Dothraki and High Valyrian (Game of Thrones), Klingon (Star Trek), Na’vi (Avatar), and Sindarin (Lord of the Rings). You may know about Klingon’s unusual object-verb-subject word order, but did you know that High Valyrian has the same tapped and trilled R sounds as Spanish? Or exactly what Na'vi has in common with beat-boxing? ",0.0
"Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here’s what’s happening..  Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening.    At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of ”pins and needles” sensations. When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I’d done something horrible to my body, anxious that I’d never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back. This phenomenon is really common, says James Dyck, a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic. And it’s actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep.    Dyck explained there’s a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. ”The more likely thing is nerve compression  —   nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms,” he says.    You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function.            The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder. The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow. The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers.    The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers. Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn’t completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep  —   when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner  —   is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted. So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking? Dyck suggests two reasons. 1) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a   paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You’re stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can’t move. 2) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).    Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a    feeling. ”The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time,” the University of Rochester Medical Center explains. ”That’s because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life.” Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem. One such case is called ”Saturday night palsy,” when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body’s ability to wake you up and protect your nerves. ”If you’re passed out drunk, you won’t move your arm,” Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can’t extend your wrist and you can’t extend your fingers.” That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating. And then there’s hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night.)    Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it’s just a temporary annoyance.  And it ”probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you’re freaking out about it,” Dyck says.  Late sleeper? Blame your genes.        ",-1.0
"Trump’s attacks on her weight are a ‘bad dream’ for former Miss Universe.  Donald Trump’s decision to attack a former Miss Universe for gaining too much weight thrust the   actress into the middle of the presidential campaign on Tuesday  —   an outcome that was welcomed and encouraged by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Alicia Machado alleges that Trump called her names such as “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because she gained weight after winning the Miss Universe crown in 1996, when Trump owned the pageant. Clinton brought up Machado’s case during Monday’s first presidential debate, prompting a furious response from Trump that night and into Tuesday next morning. “She was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst. She was impossible,” Trump said of Machado in an interview on Fox News Channel Tuesday. “. . . She was the winner, and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. ” Trump’s broadside was aimed at a bilingual Latina immigrant who recently became a U. S. citizen  —   representing two key categories of voters Clinton needs to turn out to vote.  Machado has been working closely with the Clinton campaign since the summer, and she and the Democratic nominee were clearly prepared for Trump’s reaction. The campaign released a   Web video telling Machado’s story after the debate, while Cosmopolitan magazine published a profile of Machado on Tuesday that included photos of her draped in an American flag.     At the Sept. 26 presidential debate, Hillary Clinton knocked Donald Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Here’s what you need to know about Machado. (Monica   Washington Post)    [Trump launches new attack on former Miss Universe, saying she ‘gained a massive amount of weight’]  Machado said in a conference call arranged by the campaign that the fresh attacks by Trump were “a bad dream. ” “I’m going to be with Mrs. Clinton until the end, whatever she needs from me, with pleasure, I’m here for her,” she said. Trump’s decision to attack Machado so personally is similar to how he confronted Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of a U. S. Army soldier killed in the Iraq War, and Gonzalo Curiel, a Mexican American federal judge overseeing legal challenges to the candidate’s   private university. He also recently went after an African American pastor in Detroit who had asked him not make a political speech while appearing at her church. On Tuesday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) demurred when asked by reporters about Trump’s comments on Machado. “I was working out and working this morning, I didn’t watch,” Ryan said. “I wasn’t watching Fox News this morning. So I’m not going to comment on something I didn’t see. ”  Machado was tabloid fodder in the late 1990s, when supermarket magazines and syndicated entertainment shows documented her     feud with Trump over her weight. Once her reign ended, she launched a successful acting career, and more recently has emerged as a political activist.     This video produced by the Clinton campaign features Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe who accused Donald Trump of being verbally abusive, calling her ”Miss Piggy” and ”Miss Housekeeping.” (Hillary Clinton)   Clinton cited Trump’s treatment of Machado in the closing minutes of debate as a way of amplifying other unflattering comments Trump has made about women. “One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them,” Clinton said. “He called this woman ‘Miss Piggy.’ Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she was Latina. ” Furious, Trump interrupted her. “Where did you find this? Where did you find this?” he asked. Clinton continued: “She has become a U. S. citizen, and you can bet she’s going to vote this November. ”  [Alicia Machado, the woman Trump called ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ is ready to vote against him]  Shortly afterward, the Clinton campaign posted a video featuring Machado speaking in Spanish about how Trump called her “fat” and “ugly. ” The video featured file footage of a televised workout session that Trump ordered Machado to attend in order to keep her crown. “So this is someone who likes to eat,” Trump said in the recording. Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Machado recounted how Trump “always treated me like a lesser thing, like garbage. ” She said in a mix of Spanish and halting English that she watched the debate with her mother and daughter and cried as Clinton recounted her story. She said she has not spoken with Trump since 1997 “and I don’t want to see him anymore, either. ” “For me, this election is like a bad dream,” Machado said. “I never thought, and I never imagined that 20 years later I would be in this position. That I would be in this moment, watching this guy doing stupid things, [making] stupid comments. ” Priorities USA, a super PAC spending tens of millions of dollars on television ads in battleground states, released a new digital ad on Tuesday highlighting Trump’s comments about Machado and other women and said it might end up in forthcoming TV ads. “Donald Trump consistently attacking women for the way they look, and nicknaming [Machado] ‘Miss Housekeeping’ simply because of her race is emblematic of why he’s struggling so badly with women and will continue to do so for the rest of the election,” said Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky.  Maria Cardona, a Democratic political consultant and Clinton supporter, cast Machado’s emergence as “brilliant” and   given that it came on National Voter Registration Day, which Democrats used to encourage Latinos and younger voters to sign up to vote and at a time when Clinton is hoping to improve her favorability rating among voters. “Anybody who has ever had a daughter, a mother, a sister who has struggled with weight, who has struggled with   with   and women themselves who go through that every single day are going to be able to relate to this story,” Cardona said. Machado hails from an influential and politically engaged extended Venezuelan family and left college to compete for the Miss Universe crown and pursue what she hoped would blossom into a career in the U. S. entertainment industry. Trump purchased the Miss Universe pageant just in time to become her boss. When she won, all Machado knew was that Trump had big plans to boost the pageant’s profile and profits. In the end, she came to view Trump as an insensitive bigot and misogynist who seemed to view the pageant and pageant contestants alike as his personal property, Machado recounted in an interview earlier this year for a Washington Post biography, “Trump Revealed. ” “I cannot believe that piece of    could possibly be president,” Machado said in the interview, adding later that Trump “behaved like a tyrant when I was Miss Universe and has behaved like a potential despot during this campaign. He lacks the basic skills to govern and is not a good human being. ”   [Flashback from 1997: Miss Universe, sizing up her reign]  Over the course of the year that Machado held the Miss Universe title  —   and, as Trump often reminded her, worked for him  —   she would feel intense pressure to shed the pounds that Trump told many television reporters, viewers and magazine readers that Machado had gained. In a 1997 interview with radio host Howard Stern  —   unearthed by BuzzFeed News on Tuesday  —   Trump called Machado an “eating machine” and said “she ate a lot of everything. ” He boasted later how he had turned Machado’s weight loss into public scene. “It has become a major event,” he said. Trump was convinced at the time that Machado’s weight gain was a violation of her contract. It even prompted officials with the Miss Venezuela pageant system to comment on her weight to the   and   media. It was never clear how much weight Machado had actually gained in the first place, with Trump claiming she had gained 50 pounds or more depending on the interview. But in a 1997 Washington Post interview, Machado called those numbers “ridiculous,” saying she gained 19 pounds at most and had lost most of it again.  “When I was preparing for Miss Universe, it was an obsession for me to not gain weight,” she told the Post then. “By the time I won, I was actually recovering. But the year leading to it, I didn’t eat at all. And whatever I ate, I threw up. I weighed 116 pounds when I won. I was skeletal. ”  Janell Ross contributed to this report. ",-0.5
"Donald Trump’s AIPAC speech live stream: time, how to watch.  Donald Trump is scheduled to address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the nation’s leading   group, Monday evening. And, as with all Trump appearances, anything could happen.    Trump’s speech is at 5 pm Eastern at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, and will be streaming live on AIPAC’s website. Nearly all the presidential candidates are speaking at AIPAC (Bernie Sanders was the only candidate to turn down the offer to speak) but all eyes will be on Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, who has a record of contradictory statements on Israel. Trump is quick to state his support for Israel during his stump speeches and says there is ”no one more  ” than himself. But when asked about the perennial issues facing the region, he has waffled on his positions.    His conflicting comments on Israel and other divisive campaign statements have prompted rabbis and other AIPAC conference attendees to plan a protest during his speech Monday evening.    Where Trump stands Support for Israel is an easy crowd pleaser for Republican presidential candidates. And if asked generally, Trump has no problem pledging his support. But he’s also said he would remain neutral on the   conflict  —   an extraordinarily unusual statement from an American presidential candidate. ”I’m a negotiator. If I go in, I’ll say I’m   and I’ve told that to everybody and anybody that would listen. But I would like to at least have the other side think I’m somewhat neutral as to them so that we can maybe get a deal done,” Trump said at a Republican debate earlier this month.    Then there is Trump’s stumbling disavowal of the support of David Duke, the former grand wizard for the Ku Klux Klan and   conspiracy theorist. This isn’t the first time Trump has spoken to a fully   crowd, having addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition last December with a speech that was riddled with Jewish stereotypes: Trump essentially said Jews only care about money and making deals. Former AIPAC spokesperson Josh Block, president and CEO of the Israel Project, said the speech will be a chance for Trump to sharpen and clarify his rhetoric on Israel. ”This speech is an important opportunity for him both to pivot to a more serious approach on foreign policy, and to provide the kind of specifics that people are looking for from each of the candidates,” Block told NPR.

"Elon Musk to Testify as Diver's Slander Trial Gets Under Way. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is reportedly scheduled to take the stand in a Los Angeles federal courtroom this week. Musk has been known to drag his companies into legal trouble—whether it's violating securities rules by tweet or puffing on a blunt during an interview while running a major government contractor. This time, though, Musk himself is on trial, defending a claim that he defamed a British man living in Thailand by calling him a pedophile. The trial, set to begin Tuesday, is the latest of a weird series of events that began in July 2018, when a youth soccer team and their coach became stranded in flooded caves in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. The story quickly captured the attention of the global news media, and of Musk, who very publicly tasked a team of engineers at SpaceX and Tesla to build a child-size submarine to help extract the soccer team from the caves. Want the latest news on Elon Musk in your inbox? Sign up here! A British expat named Vernon Unsworth worked as a diver in the area, and did not think Musk’s plan was a good one. When asked by a CNN reporter for comment, Unsworth said Musk’s mini-sub scheme wouldn’t work, and that the whole thing was a publicity stunt. Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts,” Unsworth told the reporter. Musk saw the comments a few days after they aired, according to his deposition in August. Musk said in the deposition that he did a spot of Googling, and saw that Unsworth’s home of Chiang Rai was linked with the sex trade. Then he tweeted that the engineering team was moving forward with the submarine plan, “no problemo.” “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it,” he wrote, referring to Unsworth. Musk apologized for the “pedo guy” tweet a few days later. But just a few weeks after that, in an email to BuzzFeed News reporter Ryan Mac, the billionaire doubled down, alleging that Unsworth was a “child rapist.” Mac published Musk’s allegations in an article. Unsworth, through his lawyer, vigorously denied that claim. Documents later revealed the strange behind-the-scenes moments that led up to the tweets. After Musk had apologized for the tweets, a British man named James Howard-Higgins reached out to Musk claiming that the diver indeed had “skeletons in his cupboard.” Musk then dispatched the head of his family office to meet with Howard-Higgins, which the employee did under an assumed name. The employee later paid Howard-Higgins more than $50,000 to dig into Unsworth’s history. Musk later said that Howard-Higgins told his employee that Unsworth had married a girl when she was as young as 12, though Unsworth’s lawyers say, based on emails, that Howard-Higgins only said that the the diver met his wife when she was 18 or 19. (In reality, Unsworth’s wife was 32 when they met, the lawyers say.) This appears to be why Musk passed that “tip” to the BuzzFeed reporter. In another twist, it turned out that Howard-Higgins was a con man with a criminal record, and may have fabricated information altogether. In September 2018, after Musk’s new allegation was published, Unsworth sued for defamation in California federal court. He is seeking at least $75,000 in damages. Now, the case is going to trial. Musk’s lawyers claimed that Unsworth was a public figure by dint of his involvement with the Thai cave rescue, which would give the CEO’s statements more protection under the First Amendment. But the federal judge assigned to the case dismissed that argument. Musk’s court appearance this week will likely involve his state of mind during the episode. In an August deposition, Musk said that he didn’t mean “pedo guy” like “pedophile.” To him, a “pedo guy” is an “old, angry white guy living in Thailand,” he said. “Why is he talking about shoving a submarine up my butt? That’s pretty weird and rude and uncalled for.” Musk said that he believed that “Thailand is a place where dodgy people go, in my experience—people who are often up to no good.” Musk’s lawyer did not respond to questions on Monday. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, emails show that the CEO has regrets about the whole episode. “I'm a fucking idiot,” Musk wrote to a public relations advisor in September 2018.",0.0
"Video: How Olympic Athletes Hack Their Sports With Physics. Besides being the birthplace of #Phelpsface, the Green Pool, and the mainstreamification of cupping, the 2016 Rio Olympic Games were also home—wonder of wonders!—to some incredible athletic feats. Though Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, and Usain Bolt’s performances seem to defy physics, we at WIRED did our best to explain the astonishing science behind some of our favorite events.

"Teen shot dead, pal injured over romantic rivalry. A romantic beef over a woman left one teen shot dead and his pal injured in Brooklyn early Friday. “It was over a girl,” a law enforcement source said of the senseless death of Keith Kyser, 17. Kyser and an unidentified    were crossing Broadway near Jefferson Avenue in Bushwick shortly before 2 a. m. when they encountered another group, officials said. Kyser’s romantic rival approached the doomed teen and wordlessly shook his hand. The two had been exchanging messages on Facebook, the source said. As if on that signal, another in the rival’s group opened fire. “It looked like from what we understand they were trying to shake hands,” Chief of Detective Robert Boyce told reporters. “At that point, someone fired rounds. ” Kyser took bullets to his torso and legs and pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital, while the other victim is being treated at the same hospital for a gunshot wound to his thigh, according to officials.",1.0
"The ‘superbug’ is here — and America’s not ready for it. Federal officials are predicting doom because a Pennsylvania woman became infected with a germ that can’t be controlled by most antibiotics.  “The medicine cabinet is empty for some patients,” warned Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden last week. You’d think this dire proclamation meant the CDC was finally ready to get serious about   infections.  Think again. The CDC watched “ ” spread across the nation, and dawdled. Centers for Denial and Confusion is more like it. The Pennsylvania woman’s infection is resistant to a   antibiotic called colistin. This is the first case, as far as we know, of an infection resistant to colistin in the United States, but thousands of patients die every year from infections resistant to more commonly used antibiotics.  As antibiotics lose their punch, medical care becomes riskier, especially in hospitals. Patients who need chemotherapy or surgery rely on antibiotics. Without them, even a routine procedure  —   bypass surgery, or    —   could turn deadly.  The medical community has struggled with drug resistance for half a century. There’s no avoiding it. Bacteria naturally evolve to resist the weapons we use to fight them. CRE  —     infections  —   have plagued New   hospitals for 15 years. CRE bloodstream infections have a 50 percent death rate. In 2011, a New York patient transferred to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. carried the germ with her, starting an outbreak that killed several patients, including a    boy.  Yet the CDC waited until 2013 to sound the alarm about this “nightmare bacteria. ” And has done little since. Three aggressive steps are needed to protect patients, but the CDC has gotten serious about only one: curbing the overuse of antibiotics. The agency is MIA on the need for rigorous cleaning and for screening incoming patients for superbugs.  Reducing antibiotic use can only do so much, because the problem is global. In countries like India, antibiotics are as easy to buy as candy. No prescription needed. Patients then come to American hospitals bringing the   bacteria with them. Plus, simply curbing antibiotic use doesn’t stop patients from getting most infections in the first place and has barely made a dent in hospital death rates. Nearly 75, 000 patients die from infections in US hospitals each year. To stop this carnage, hospitals need to clean up. Shockingly, your risk of getting an infection often depends on your hospital room number. If a previous patient in that room had a superbug, you’re in danger. The previous patient’s germs are still lurking on the bedrail and privacy curtain. Half the surfaces in a hospital room are overlooked by cleaning staff. There are technologies to overcome this human error  —   robotic   misters, UV light machines and newer devices that operate   to disinfect a room with no risk to patients.  But the CDC drags its feet about recommending them. So, if you’re visiting someone in the hospital, skip the flowers. Instead, bring bleach wipes and clean the surfaces around their bed for them. You could save a life. The CDC’s failure to call for screening incoming patients defies reason. During the AIDS crisis, the CDC recommended testing all patients for AIDS. Why not superbugs? Hospital infections kill four times as many people. And contracting AIDS is difficult, but picking up a hospital germ is as easy as touching the call button. New screening tools can detect superbugs in minutes, instead of   cultures that take three days. As a result, patients who test positive for a superbug can be whisked into a single room to stop their germs from spreading.  Using a new, rapid test, Washington,   hospitals screened patients and found more than 5 percent unknowingly carry deadly CRE germs. That shows the urgent need to make screening routine.  The intractable infection in Pennsylvania is a   call. Patients and advocates need to demand aggressive infection prevention in hospitals. We have the tools to eradicate these infections. What’s lacking is the will.",1.0
"Why best and boldest Yankees lineup isn’t one Girardi will pick. TAMPA  —   Joe Girardi plans to look at a lot of lineups in spring training games and feels he cannot settle on a standard order until “we see how right field and first base pan out. ” That process grew more serious Sunday with the Yankees’ full squad taking the field for the first time. There are a lot of judgments  —   or in the case of right field,    —   between now and Opening Day, on April 2, one of the biggest being whether Girardi will follow through and split up what has been the   duo of Brett Gardner and Jacoby Ellsbury, the one player yet to report as he awaits the birth of his child. I believe he should break up that tandem, and assuming the expected  —   Aaron Judge is the main right fielder and Greg Bird is at first  —   my lineup would be: 1. Gardner. 2. Gary Sanchez. 3. Bird. 4. Matt Holliday. 5. Didi Gregorius. 6. Starlin Castro. 7. Chase Headley. 8. Judge. 9. Ellsbury. Already, I can tell you that will not be Girardi’s lineup, since the Yankee manager explained, “If I do split [Gardner and Ellsbury] up, I don’t anticipate having them hit one and nine. ” That is because he still would have lefties consecutively when the lineup turned over. Here is why I would go with my lineup:  The best hitter should hit second, not third, and I have been blown away by how many Yankees officials agree. “I love it,” bench coach Rob Thomson said. He cited mainly extra   over the season for the second hitter and perhaps more fastballs if a fleet leadoff man gets on. Until proven otherwise, Sanchez is the Yankees’ best hitter, despite only two strong months in the majors last season.  The   duo needs to be broken up atop the order. Gardner conceded the pair “did not have a great year” in 2016, but he said he still thinks it can be dynamic. However, both turn 34 late in the season, and there is diminishing belief either has enough individually to justify both getting the most   on the team as the   atop the order. Gardner is superior in seeing pitches and getting on base, so he should bat leadoff. If the Yankees are playing a team without a lefty starter and quality lefty relief, Girardi can bat them   occasionally. Or if one has superior matchup numbers against an opposing pitcher, Girardi can   them.  It would not be the worst thing to bat Ellsbury ninth as a message that his $153 million contract does not guarantee he will hit atop the lineup or even play regularly if better, younger alternatives come along. You sense the organization’s growing frustration with Ellsbury as both Brian Cashman and Girardi expressed a need to get more from him. But the main fault lies with the Yankees giving an   player without a history of consistent excellence a contract that still has four years and $89. 6 million left on it.  Yes, Ellsbury and Gardner still would bat    hitting ninth and first. But the rest of the lineup goes    making opposing relief matchups more difficult. Also, Ellsbury would bat less frequently, and his spot would be a sign that, when necessary, someone such as Chris Carter could hit for him against a lefty. In addition, this would replicate an NL lineup, in which the pitcher hits eighth with   forming a secondary top of the lineup in front of Sanchez.  This puts a lot of burden on Sanchez and Bird. But that is fine. For the Yankees to be good this year, that young duo needs to be good. Plus, part of this season is about giving youth opportunity to see what it can do as the Yankees try to envision exactly what their   roster is going to look like. Girardi did not dismiss the idea of Bird hitting third, although he missed all of last season following shoulder surgery, saying, “We only have a short sample size for him [in 2015] but yes, I think he could [handle third] because it was an impressive short sample size [11 homers, . 871 OPS in 46 games]. ”  As opposed to Bird and Sanchez, who thrived in   cameos, Judge has not done that yet. Thus, he should begin as the   hitter and earn his way up the lineup. The Yanks are encouraged that eliminating an exaggerated leg kick can make Judge less vulnerable to breaking balls away and  —   they hope  —   reduce his strikeouts and play up his power further. In the Yankees’ dream scenario, they are hitting Sanchez, Bird and Judge consecutively near the top of the lineup at some time this season because each is healthy and has proven he can handle the responsibility. For now, I would hit Judge eighth, just in front of a declining former leadoff man named Jacoby Ellsbury.",1.0
"Are we witnessing the end of the Fox News era?.  In many ways, this is the election that Fox News built. For years, the network has stoked the fires of   resentment of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and ”liberal elites”  —   while simultaneously giving prominence and credibility to the Tea Party, to ”issues” like birtherism and the New Black Panthers, and to those darlings of the   right Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. Its coverage foreshadowed much of what makes the Trump campaign distinctive  —   the bluster, the conspiratorial mindset, the Obama hatred  —   even if the network was, at first, resistant to embracing the real estate mogul.    A casual observer might think Donald Trump’s candidacy would be a triumphant moment for Fox News. Yet the network was in turmoil even before its chair and CEO, Roger Ailes, left the network amid sexual harassment allegations  —   which he did on the first day of the 2016 Republican convention. We shouldn’t understate the importance of Ailes’s departure. For 20 years, the television producer and political consultant had provided the guiding vision for the network, micromanaging everything from the onscreen artwork to the state of the studio hallways (  and utilitarian, to keep folks from being lulled into complacency by posh surroundings). It was fair to wonder, with Ailes out, what would become of the network he had built. But the loss of Ailes may turn out to be a side story in the long run. That’s because the disruption of Fox by   media rivals had begun well before Ailes’s exit. By the time the harassment charges surfaced, the conservative GOP built in the late 1990s was in disarray, and Fox News, the party’s house organ, was facing its own insurgency.    Not only were insiders divided over what they had spawned  —   Trumpism  —   but the network was feeling the heat from new outlets, including Breitbart, that saw Fox News as the establishment that needed toppling.    The network was a conservative dream made real To understand Fox News today, you have to place it in the context of the growth of   media over the past  . When the network went live 20 years ago, it was the fulfillment of a   dream for conservatives, who  had been eyeing television for decades, believing it was key to changing both the political and media landscape. But TV continually confounded them. In the 1960s, a few conservative radio programs, like the Manion Forum and The Dan Smoot Report  —   hosted by Clarence Manion and Dan Smoot  —    had complementary television shows, but they reached tiny audiences and were  .    Why was television so hard to crack? Bias was the pet theory of many conservatives, including D. B. Lewis, a dog food manufacturer who sponsored the Manion and Smoot shows in California. He believed the main barrier to conservative programming was the networks’ unwillingness to syndicate controversial   shows. There was something to the idea  —   or, at least, local station owners believed the same thing. They refused to sell Lewis time for Smoot and Manion’s programs, fearing they would alienate their established audiences and drive away advertisers. The right’s frustration over this blackout led to the first attempt to establish a conservative television network. The project, undertaken in 1965, was the brainchild of David Dye, a businessman from Lubbock, Texas. Believing that all media was ”dominated by liberal and internationalist managements,” Dye founded Medias Unlimited, whose main purpose was to organize conservative shareholders to take over a major network. The Dye plan was a long shot, to put it mildly. Dye bought 200 shares of CBS, then gave himself the goal of getting 1, 000 others to do the same. Each of those 1, 000 was instructed to recruit 20 more share buyers in order for conservatives to have a controlling interest in CBS. CBS did gain 13, 000 new shareholders in the first half of 1965  —   ”We are confident that most of these are ‘our’ people,” Dye told the radio host Paul Harvey  —   but conservatives never mustered enough shares to enact Dye’s plan. The dream of a conservative network would have to wait.             While Dye wanted to seize control of a network, another media entrepreneur was more narrowly targeting the world of TV news. Roger Ailes, who had built a career in entertainment television  —   notably as executive producer of The Mike Douglas Show  —   latched,   onto the 1968 Nixon campaign. He attempted, with middling success, to turn the reticent Nixon into the first   . He couldn’t wangle his way into a position within the administration, but he did convince the Nixon team to use him as a consultant on media matters.    That’s how Ailes came to weigh in on a 1970 White House memo called ”A Plan for Putting the GOP in the News.” The project proposed, not a network, exactly, but a system for getting ” ” video packages into the hands of local news stations. Ailes offered to run the project, which was to be called the Capitol News Service. Why had his interest shifted from entertainment to news? Opportunism, most likely. A year earlier, Vice President Spiro Agnew had fired the opening shot in a war against the press, challenging the practice of ”instant analysis,” where network anchors and commentators dissected press conferences and presidential announcements as soon as they concluded. The practice, while tame compared with today’s gabfests, enraged President Richard Nixon, who saw it as one more way the press was attempting to undermine his presidential authority; he unleashed Agnew on the ”closed fraternity of privileged men, elected by no one” who managed the nightly news. The Capitol News Service might have been just the thing to address this problem, despite the whiff of propaganda it emitted, but it never quite got off the ground. A year later the White House severed ties with Ailes, who temporarily retreated back into entertainment  —   theater this time. His reentry point, in 1974, was Television News Incorporated, TVN. Dreamed up by former ABC exec Robert Pauley and funded by conservative millionaire Joseph Coors, TVN aimed to be a   news service that largely concealed its ideological bent. Unable to turn a profit, TVN shut down one year after Ailes was brought in to whip it into shape. But it was there that Ailes got a taste for creating conservative news, one he would satisfy 20 years later, when technology  —   and politics  —   was more in line with his goals. Fusing the conservative movement and the Republican Party  —   in one network There were many things that made 1996 an auspicious year for the launch of Fox News. Cable had come of age, bursting open the bandwidth from a handful of channels to dozens. Innovations in digital cable and satellite were on the cusp of increasing that capacity exponentially, while that year’s Telecommunications Act began the deregulation of the entire industry.    Just as important, the Republican Party had made a sharp turn to the right. By the   it was possible to talk about the GOP and the conservative movement as though they were the same thing, something that wouldn’t have made much sense in earlier decades. The merger of the movement and party meant Fox News would sit at the confluence of two streams: conservative media and Republican politics. Since the 1950s, conservative media activists had been training the grassroots right to reject mainstream media sources and seek out conservative voices. But not necessarily Republican voices. It’s true that from 1964 on, conservative media personalities largely supported the Republican Party. Quite often, however, they were willing to break from it. There were many on the right who refused to support Nixon in 1968, but by 1972 the entirety of the conservative movement was in revolt, thanks to Nixon’s decision to open relations with communist China. And 1976 was a boom year for     schemes. Throughout the 1960s and ’70s, conservatives flirted with the GOP but weren’t quite ready to wed it.             Ailes, however, was all in; from the start, his interest was in advancing the Republican Party. After TVN failed, Ailes wandered through a number of Republican administrations. Then in 1992 he crossed the   barrier one last time. With talk radio host Rush Limbaugh’s star rising and George H. W. Bush’s reelection campaign flailing, Ailes swapped Bush for Rush, becoming executive producer of Limbaugh’s new television show. Before he did, however, he used the radio star to try to rescue the embattled president. In the summer of 1992, Ailes and Limbaugh were Bush’s guests at the White House, a move that led to far more favorable coverage on Rush’s program. Ailes backed the right horse. Bush lost, but Rush kept accruing power. Over the next few years, he was hailed as the voice of the Republican revolution, an honorary member of the GOP. The merger of conservatism and Republicanism was complete. It was in this political setting that Ailes, partnered with Rupert Murdoch, launched his new cable venture. Murdoch provided the money, Ailes the vision, and on October 7, 1996, the Fox News Channel went live. That the first conservative network was a news network mattered. The denizens of talk radio seldom positioned themselves as the opposite of journalists: They were brash, opinionated, ideological. Fox News blended that talk radio aggressiveness with a hard news persona  —  with the sort of   reporting that Ailes sought while working for Nixon.    Under the winking tagline ”Fair and Balanced,” Ailes and Murdoch created a new media model more reminiscent of   party papers than   journalism. Those papers had delivered the news with a partisan spin, and sometimes even had overt ties to parties. They functioned as the campaign surrogates of the day, before they were crowded out first by the penny press and then by the rise of objective reporting. What Fox News had that those papers didn’t was a   auteur with an entertainment background. Ailes’s vision informed most decisions at the network, where politics blended with entertainment, just as news mixed with opinion. And it wasn’t just the glossy sets and flashy chyrons. Women hired as   talent had to meet his standards for beauty, which gave rise to the ”Fox News blonde”  —   blonde being Ailes’s preference. He installed   desks and a leg cam to make sure audiences got an eyeful of the women’s legs, always on display thanks to requisite   dresses. He passed it off as a part of entertaining audiences; in 2016, as more and more accusers came forward, it started to look like a pathology. Fox News was in a new and dangerous position. It had become part of the conservative establishment  —   just as the grassroots right was turning on that establishment.  But that was after the fall. At the time, it was a winning formula. By 2001, the station was in a prime position, with the best ratings in cable news and the   scenario in Washington: a Republican president and Congress. The Bush years were good for Fox News, which had become the   channel of the GOP right. Nor was Bush’s defeat much of a problem. Just as Limbaugh had thrived in the Clinton years, so too was Fox set to stay on top during the Obama years. The channel became the media arm of the government in exile. The Tea Party may have been born on CNBC  —   with a rant by correspondent Rick Santelli  —   but it was raised at the News Corp. building, where Fox News personalities nurtured the movement, appearing at rallies and offering    coverage of the raucous 2009 ”town hall” meetings. With the White House in Democratic hands, Fox News took on a new role: an incubator for presidential hopefuls. Sarah Palin transitioned easily from the campaign trail to the news studio. After she resigned as governor, her spot at Fox scored her a   paycheck and a chance to keep her face front and center.    Nor was she the only one using the tactic. Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum: These    2012 hopefuls all had contracts with Fox in the runup to the primaries. And if their membership in the pundit class led them to say impolitic things from time to time  —   well, maybe the base, filled with Fox News watchers, had developed a taste for the impolitic. They weren’t the only ones eyeing 2012. With a   primary, Ailes wanted to be kingmaker. As Gabe Sherman recounts in The Loudest Voice in the Room, Ailes told Fox executives, ”We’re making a lot of money  —   that’s fine. But I want to elect the next president.” And with GOP presidential hopefuls scrambling to reach Fox’s audience, it seemed like he would get his wish. Home of the Tea Party as well as the GOP’s presidential bench, Fox had achieved Ailes’s vision. The Republican Party had its media voice, and conservatives had their network. The unraveling of Fox News The trouble began, counterintuitively enough, with the Tea Party. Fox News had blanketed the airwaves with early coverage of the movement, and the Tea Party’s figureheads, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin, were stars at the network. Beck in particular was a ratings juggernaut. But Palin and Beck were independent operators who increasingly pushed back against Ailes’s advice; Ailes was reportedly uncomfortable with Beck’s   politics and apocalyptic worldview. Moreover, untested Tea Party candidates seemed to be hurting the GOP as much as helping it. Reticence toward the Tea Party began to open up an   divide  —   with Fox News on the establishment side. In 2012, both Gingrich and Santorum took public swipes at the network, arguing it was biased toward establishment favorite Mitt Romney. Shortly thereafter, with their interests increasingly diverging from those of Fox, Palin and Beck both parted ways with the network. Soon, both started new media enterprises of their own. More trouble came in 2013. As Marco Rubio began to push for immigration reform, so too did a number of Fox News personalities, including Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. For conservatives opposed to reform, this seemed like too much of a coincidence, and they were right. In early 2016 the New York Times broke the story that Rubio and Chuck Schumer had met with Ailes and Murdoch in January 2013 to get the channel to back reform. The network executives agreed, not anticipating the scale of the backlash against the Senate reform efforts. Fox News was in a new and dangerous position. It had become part of the conservative establishment  —   just as the grassroots right was turning on that establishment.    Other threats appeared as well, driven by new technologies. The conservative web exploded during the 2000s. New digital cable and internet news networks popped up: Glenn Beck’s the Blaze (which is now struggling) the One America News Network, Newsmax TV. They had a brasher style and wore their ideology even more openly than Fox. Fox News might interview Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash. One America News aired the documentary based on his book. There was also a heavier dose of conspiracy on the new networks. Newsmax TV has aired ”Roswell Top Secret,” and it features Dick Morris, author of the 2012 book Here Comes the Black Helicopters!. Fox was no longer the only place for the grassroots right to turn, nor the only channel where   conservative personalities could go to make a name for themselves. But the conservative media world didn’t just expand. It fragmented. There was no longer any reason to stick with conservative media sources that didn’t quite match your politics. If National Review was insufficiently   there was Pamela Geller’s blog Atlas Shrugs. If the neoconservative Weekly Standard was too hawkish, there was the relatively   American Conservative. And if Fox News shows were pushing immigration reform, there was Breitbart. Breitbart News started off as the Fox News of the internet: a   site guided by conservative politics. That changed when, following the death of Andrew Breitbart, Stephen Bannon took over. Bannon’s politics were   but not strictly conservative. They were decidedly more populist, with far more tolerance for the political fringes. Bannon brought aboard Milo Yiannopoulus, the spokesperson of the  . Yiannopoulos described himself and the   as free speech fundamentalists, whose willingness to offend was an expression of their freedom. But that language provided cover for   white nationalists, misogynists, and other fringe groups long banished from American politics. They now have a home on Breitbart.             Breitbart now rejects the label of conservative, opting instead to call itself  . The site calls for conservatives to give up their ideological commitments to free trade and become populists on immigration, trade, and foreign policy  —   in other words, to transform from the base of the party of Reagan to that of the party of Trump.    Is Bannon the new Ailes? Both men moved over to the Trump campaign from their respective organizations  —   Bannon as campaign manager, Ailes as a consultant (now reportedly at odds with his client, who is apparently less coachable than Nixon). Both come from entertainment backgrounds. But Bannon is the younger man, and seems temperamentally to be more in touch with Trump and his more avid supporters. And unlike Ailes, he’s no acolyte of the Republican Party. Unless the next Republican nominee is a   candidate, Bannon may want to challenge the GOP rather than shore it up. The fragmenting of the   media mirrors the fracturing of the American right. The conservatism forged in the postwar era still exists, but it now shares space with populist nationalists, unreconstructed libertarians, and the  . The Republican Party has not yet figured out how to accommodate this contentious coalition of interests. Except for a few establishment types and a sprinkling of foreign policy experts, most of these factions are doing their best to give an impression of unity, but that will fall away after November 8  —   especially if Trump loses. Party leaders need the grassroots right, the source of the party’s energy. And they have no real way to purge the Trumpists from their ranks. But how do these factions square their incompatible preferences? How do free traders coexist with protectionists? How do reformicons, keen to build a broader, more inclusive party, make peace with the decidedly   supporters of the Trump campaign? Coalition building is not out of the question, but civil war seems far more likely. And Fox News? As it marks its 20th anniversary, it too is in flux. Without Ailes at the helm, it may be easier for the organization to adapt to this new American right. Sean Hannity, a Trump booster from the start, could be the entering wedge, along with Eric Bolling, Trump’s defender on the panel show The Five. Or, equally likely, it will be a casualty of the   war, a sacrifice to the gods of populism. Either way, it is unlikely to retain its singular place in the conservative media landscape. Having benefited from the labors of the first generation of conservative media, Fox News is well on its way to being eclipsed by the third.

"Trump’s night of sniffles and screw-ups.  My heart went out to Donald Trump Monday night when it appeared that he was under the weather.  What could be worse than to be sick, sniffling through his first presidential debate just days after he was challenging Hillary Clinton’s health and, during the debate, taunting her lack of stamina? Trump’s own stamina was not, shall we say, in abundance Monday.   and gulping water, he looked as though he might fall asleep were it not for the lectern’s support. Could his malady perhaps explain his utter incoherence? Might whatever was drying out his mouth, but not his nose, explain his childish running commentary as Clinton was answering a question?  As karma would have it, Clinton seemed perky by comparison. Pitch perfect throughout the debate, she was never at a loss for a coherent answer or a rebound. She even managed to conquer her habitual impulse to nod her head affirmatively when someone else is talking.  Otherwise, she smiled through her contempt for Trump’s inane responses or nonresponses. In the course of the evening, she seemed to get him to admit to not paying any federal taxes, which Trump appeared to confirm by saying, “That makes me smart. ” Moderator Lester Holt’s question about Trump’s birther crusade elicited not only a defense of his efforts but a declaration of pride that he, Trump, had forced President Obama to present his birth certificate.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had a case of the sniffles during the first presidential debate on Sept. 26  —   so we put them all in one supercut, with a few of his interruptions for good measure. (Gillian   Washington Post)   “I think I did a good job,” he said.  This is false, as any serious news consumer knows. But these two examples illustrate two key components of Trump’s character  —   braggadocio and preening pride. Translation: insecurity and weakness. He was proud of two things  —   paying no taxes and racist pandering  —   for which most people of conscience would feel shame.  Sure, if you’re someone whose career is built on gaming the system, you might gloat about being the best gamer. But is this who you want for president?  As for racist pandering, that’s what birtherism was. It was never really about Obama’s birthplace, no matter who thought of it first. Democrats aren’t any more virtuous than Republicans when it comes to foul play; Republicans are just better at it.  In Sniffles’ hands, the birther issue was an instrument to mine the subliminal racist attitudes that Trump knew were out there. His strategy was to constantly remind voters of Obama’s Kenyan heritage, thus building a rapport with a certain segment of the population that ultimately would catapult him onto the debate stage. He subsequently reinforced his monument to infamy by marginalizing other   groups, including Mexicans and Muslims of Middle Eastern extraction.  Thusly was Trump’s presidential campaign launched. His    descent on the escalator of New York’s Trump Tower was merely a dramatization of the direction he would lead his acolytes and, if elected, the nation. During his part of the “debate,” Trump did manage to make a couple of points, notably that Clinton is a career politician while he’s a builder and job creator. Noted. Otherwise, he was often if not mostly a donnybrook of babbling nonsense. At one juncture, criticizing Clinton for posting her   State plan on her website (as opposed to not actually having a plan) he said with rough conviction: “No wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. ”      Here are the key moments from the first 2016 presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Sept. 26. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt moderated the debate at Hofstra University in New York. (Sarah   Washington Post)   Asked by Holt what he would do to prevent cyberattacks, Trump replied: “As far as the cyber . . . we should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we’re not. I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia. . . . Maybe it was. . . . But it could also be China, it could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. ”  What came next was, well, this: “You don’t know who broke into DNC, but what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people. By [former DNC Chair] Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. ”  As a matter of fairness, I would include similarly confused responses by Clinton, but there were none. When the worst criticism is that you’re “overprepared,” as some have accused Clinton, you’re in pretty good shape,  . Meanwhile, the global marketplace may tell the larger story. As the evening concluded, thanks to Clinton’s obvious dominance, as well as her assertion that a Clinton presidency would honor U. S. commitments abroad, the Asian markets recovered, the Mexico peso rallied, and Dow futures added 100 points. That’s nothing to sneeze at  —   or sniffle about.

"Trump’s executive order to remove protections for national monuments, explained.  In his latest assault on protections for federal lands, President Trump has just signed an executive order that calls for the review of all national monuments created in the past 20 years that are at least 100, 000 acres in size.    The order authorizes Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to determine whether more than two dozen national monuments created since 1996 should remain federally protected or whether they should be stripped of their status and reopened for development.  In a White House press conference Tuesday evening, Zinke told reporters that such a review was “long overdue,” and that in recent years, national monuments had ballooned in size and were now jeopardizing jobs and economic growth, particularly in western states like Utah and California. “By and large, the Antiquities Act and the monuments that we’ve protected have done a great service to the public,” Zinke told reporters, but went on to say, “Those out in the West would probably say it’s abused. ”    One such example is the controversial Bears Ears Monument, which President Obama designated as a 1. 35 million acre national monument in Utah during his last few days of office and President Trump is now seeking to dismantle. Also under attack in Utah is the 1. 7 million acre Grand   which President Clinton created in 1996.    Zinke did not say which other national monuments the administration was specifically targeting, but did promise to decide on the status of Bears Ears in the next 45 days. As for the other national monuments under review, he said he will issue a final report in the next 120 days. Why national monuments are under attack, and how Teddy Roosevelt’s obscure law to designate federal lands became a target Wednesday’s executive order is really a political battle over a relatively obscure federal law known as the Antiquities Act, which President Theodore Roosevelt created in 1906 as a way for presidents to designate federal lands without congressional approval. (National parks, on the other hand, must be approved by Congress).    The law was passed so presidents could act quickly to protect some of America’s most pristine lands from development (namely, mining and drilling for oil and gas) but Republican lawmakers have criticized its use in recent years, arguing that the executive branch is overstepping its powers.  At the heart of the dispute is that national monument designations prohibit new development like drilling for oil and gas  —   and because national monuments have increased in size, this means less land is available for development. And in states like Utah where oil and natural gas are important to the economy, lawmakers are incensed. House Natural Resources Committee Chair Rep. Rob Bishop ( ) has long been critical of the law and has said he welcomes the executive order and will push legislation in the House to both rescind Bears Ears’ federally protected status and dismantle the Antiquities Act.    But what Bishop is proposing  —   overturning Bears Ears’ federally protected status  —   has no precedent. Congress currently possesses the power to eliminate national monuments but has done so only a handful of times and never for a monument on the scale of Bears Ears, which is more than 1 million acres and considered sacred to local Native American tribes. Republicans like Bishop are arguing that the Antiquities Act could be used to completely do away with national monuments instead of just creating them. But no president has ever attempted this, which Secretary Zinke admitted during last night’s  White House press briefing. ”It is untested . .. whether the president can do that,” he said of abolishing a national monument. There are roughly 30 national monuments at risk of losing their federally protected status, and below is an interactive map of which monuments are currently being reviewed. The map was created by the environmental conservation advocacy organization Center for Western Priorities, and as you can see, nearly all of the targeted national monuments are located in western states, which have long struggled to strike a balance between development and federally protected lands. And we can now anticipate a renewed fight between America’s responsibility to protect federal lands and the administration’s staunchly   agenda.  ",-1.0
"Mark Zuckerberg's Cambridge Analytica Interviews Ignore the Big Questions. After five days of silence, Mark Zuckerberg undertook an apology tour today, posting to Facebook and speaking to a few media outlets (including WIRED) about the Cambridge Analytica scandal that has embroiled his company. He acknowledged to WIRED that trusting Cambridge Analytica was ""one of the biggest mistakes we made."" He referred to transparency as ""an area where we need to do a lot better."" Still, he implied that he and his company were doing as well as anyone could expect. After all, as he told WIRED, ""there's no way that sitting in a dorm room in 2004 you're going to solve everything upfront."" And, of course, he pointed out the ""good news"" that ""big actions that we needed to take to prevent this from happening today, we took three or four years ago."" Zuckerberg's performance repeated the familiar beats of a traditional Facebook mea-kinda-culpa. It's similar to the tone struck by executive Andrew Bosworth when he tweeted that, well actually, Cambridge Analytica's purloining of Facebook users data for use in political subterfuge is ""unequivocally not a data breach"" because ""no systems were infiltrated."" It also smacked of Zuckerberg's regrettable statement in November 2016 that it was ""a pretty crazy idea"" to think that fake news had an impact on the election since, if you looked at the data, it represented a small percentage of all the communications posted to Facebook. (Zuckerberg has since walked back that statement.) None of this is to dispute the facts as Zuckerberg presents them. Facebook really did shut down the program that allowed researchers to hoover up data on 50 million Facebook users, most of whom never consented to it—so, technically, a non-breach like Cambridge Analytica could not happen today. But that is missing the forest for the user IDs. Yes, Facebook needs to do more to protect our data, but it also needs to reckon with the function it has come to perform in our communications infrastructure—providing advertisers and politicians with powerful tools to manipulate its users' opinions and moods without sufficient transparency. The classic non-apology relies on the passive tense: ""mistakes were made."" To his credit, Zuckerberg used the active voice in his Facebook post when he announced that ""we also made mistakes."" But in his interview with WIRED, he added to the passive-tense canon with his own chestnut: ""The world is changing quickly and social norms are changing quickly."" Zuckerberg suggests this as a reason why Facebook sometimes falls short—who can be expected to flawlessly adapt to such constant change? But in doing so, he neglects the fact that Facebook itself is the source of much of that change. The debates around fake news and hate speech did not happen to befall Facebook; we are having them in part because of Facebook. Zuckerberg often paints his company in this light, as fundamentally reflecting its users' and society's behavior rather than shaping it. Fixing fake news is a ""hard problem""—ignoring Facebook's role in creating the problem in the first place. The social norms around privacy are ""just something that's evolved over time,"" a stance that elides his company's interest in nudging that evolution along. Zuckerberg is treating the Cambridge Analytica scandal similarly. The company was a bad actor, an aberration, that Facebook had to deal with. That's why Facebook has responded with policy solutions. That's reasonable, but the bigger question is whether Facebook bears some responsibility for creating the environment that allowed bad actors like Cambridge Analytica to flourish. As critic Neil Postman presciently wrote in 1992, ""we are surrounded by the wondrous effects of machines and are encouraged to ignore the ideas embedded in them."" Facebook's users are beginning to pay attention and challenge those embedded ideas. Is more connection necessarily a good thing? Is it still a good deal to trade our data for more effective digital products? Can the value of a piece of communication be quantified in likes, shares, and comments? These are questions that Zuckerberg has not asked, and maybe cannot ask. But the rest of us can—if it's not too late. Postman was not optimistic. ""Once a technology is admitted,"" he wrote, ""it plays out its hand; it does what it is designed to do. Our task is to understand what that design is—that is to say, when we admit a new technology to the culture, we must do so with our eyes wide open.""",0.0
"Delaware girl dies after fight with other girls in high school bathroom.      A    girl died Thursday after she was assaulted in a high school bathroom in Wilmington, Del. authorities said. A fight among several female students broke out at about 8:15 a. m. Thursday in a girls’ bathroom at Wilmington’s Howard High School of Technology, according to school officials. No weapons were involved, but the    sophomore sustained serious injuries and was taken by helicopter to A. I. duPont Hospital in Wilmington, where she died. The name of the deceased student has not been released. School officials said that two other female students were involved in the incident and both are being questioned by Wilmington police. “We are shaken but stand ready to provide support and care to the family, to Howard students and staff, and to all of those affected by this act of senseless violence. We ask that you do the same,” officials with New Castle County   School District said in a statement. “This is not only an unspeakable tragedy for her family, but also for the school, and the entire community. ”    A student cries in front of Howard High School of Technology on Thursday. (Suchat   Wilmington   via AP)  Howard students were kept in their classrooms until school was dismissed early, at 10:15 a. m. Howard students told   a Philadelphia station, that the fight was over a boy. One student told the station that she was in the bathroom when the fight began:  “She was fighting a girl, and then that’s when all these other girls started banking her  —   like jumping her  —   and she hit her head on the sink,” the student said. Wilmington police said in a statement that homicide detectives are continuing to investigate the incident. Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams’ voice shook at a press conference Thursday. “I am so upset that a young lady lost her life today. Things like this shouldn’t happen,” Williams said. “My heart bleeds for the family, kids who go to this school and the administrators, and our city. ”    Mayor Dennis Williams speaks at a news conference at Howard High School of Technology on Thursday, April 21, 2016, in Wilmington, Del.

"Trump prepares to address a divided audience: The Republican Congress.  President Trump is coming to Capitol Hill on Tuesday night to address the nation  —   and, perhaps more important, his fellow Republicans in Congress who stand divided on key aspects of his legislative agenda. On health care, tax reform and federal spending, GOP lawmakers hold differences of opinion that are obstructing passage of ambitious Republican policies, and so far Trump has shown little desire to referee those disputes openly. The discord was on display Tuesday as Trump prepared to deliver his first speech as president to a joint session of Congress. The speech, set for prime time, is expected to outline Trump’s budget goals and other administration priorities. Many Republican members said this week that they are eager for Trump to provide clear marching orders and engage with them directly on his ambitious pledges. “I think he’s had that learning curve, but it comes to the point where the honeymoon is over and we need to do these things,” said Rep. Ted Yoho ( . ). “I’m just optimistic and I hope things are going to change drastically in this country. ”      (Peter   Washington Post)    [Six critical reactions to keep an eye on during the address]  Democrats, meanwhile, are using the address as an opportunity to take fresh aim at Trump’s agenda, which has stoked controversy and drawn fierce protests across the country. They are focusing particularly closely on the president’s efforts to undo key parts of the Affordable Care Act and his   policies on immigration and border security. Rep. Eliot L. Engel ( . Y.) who has been on the aisle of the House chamber for every presidential address to Congress for nearly three decades, announced on the House floor Tuesday that he has “decided not to stand on aisle of the House chamber to shake the president’s hand” this time. He said he made his decision because the administration has shown “no interest” in working with Congress to address the country’s problems.  [Democrats’ dilemma: To shake or not to shake Trump’s hand]  Democratic leaders have selected former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear to deliver the official response to Trump’s speech. Supporters of the ACA have often pointed to Kentucky as a model for successful implementation of the law. Astrid Silva, an immigration activist and a “dreamer,” will deliver the   response to Trump’s speech. The biggest problem for Hill Republicans is that Trump, so far, has not moved beyond vague pledges to immediately repeal and replace the ACA, build a massive wall on the southern border, launch a   infrastructure plan and overhaul the tax code. It is unclear whether he will elaborate in his speech Tuesday night. The lack of direction from the new president  —   who is defining his own brand of Republicanism  —   is making it harder for Hill Republicans to coalesce around the specifics of their own priorities. One big area of dissonance is the   system, where House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) has outlined a series of potential changes to the ACA that have so far failed to unite the rank and file. Replacing Obamacare has been a signature campaign promise for congressional Republicans over the seven years since it was enacted. “We’re doing this step by step,” Ryan said Tuesday on NBC’s “Today” show. “This is how the legislative process is supposed to be designed. We’re not hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the American people’s front door. ” Among the possibilities being floated are replacing   tax subsidies  —   which phase out for wealthier Americans  —   with   tax credits available to all individuals regardless of income. The Ryan plan also targets the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, ramping it down over a series of years in a plan that could possibly grandfather in   individuals who now use the program for coverage. “The draft proposals are proposals that have been created by a consensus in the Senate and the House,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “We’ve had a bicameral working group for more than a month. ”   But that consensus did not include a trio of conservative senators known for bucking party leaders. Nor did it include the heads of influential groups of House conservatives.  “Conservatives are for complete repeal,” said Sen. Rand Paul ( . ). He said the emerging plan in the House is “incomplete repeal,” which he would vote against.  Paul exited a Senate GOP policy lunch alongside Sens. Ted Cruz ( .) and Mike Lee ( ) who have also called for a sweeping repeal of the law.  “I think rolling out a massive new entitlement program is not the right way to go,” Cruz said when asked about the idea of tax credits. Cruz said he would wait to see the final details of the plan before assessing it.  House conservative leaders said Monday that they were dismayed by aspects of the GOP leadership plan  —   including the tax credits and a proposal to pay for them by rolling back the existing income tax deduction for   insurance. “The way it’s put forth would actually take the number of tax credits from 9. 5 million people that get a subsidy today and potentially increase it to 40 million people,” said Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. “We’re going to pay for that by putting a tax on union workers and   workers that happen to have good employer insurance. That dog doesn’t hunt. ” Rep. Mark Walker ( . C.) chairman of the larger Republican Study Committee, said Monday he saw “serious problems” with the current plan and could not recommend that his group’s members support it, saying it “risks continuing major Obamacare entitlement expansions and delays any reforms. ” “We’ve got to have more information,” he said in an interview. “As it stands right now, we have a real problem with the Medicaid expansion” that he believes would be phased out too slowly. In an interview with Fox News Channel on Tuesday, Trump said he planned on Tuesday night to “speak from the heart” and talk about health care, the military and border security. “Health care is a very complex subject,” Trump said. “If you do this, it affects nine different things. If you do that, it affects 15 different things. I think we have a great plan and I think Congress is absolutely taking a lot of blame, but it’s not their fault. And don’t forget, I’ve only been here for, like, four weeks. ” Republicans were equally fractured over the first elements of Trump’s spending plans. Many Republicans cheered a budget skeleton sketched out Monday by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney that would add $54 billion in defense spending while cutting the same amount from nondefense programs.  [Fight over debt ceiling could accelerate budget clash]  The general plan was in line with GOP pledges and marks the beginning of a   process to hammer out the final numbers. Yet budget and defense hawks, as well as appropriators, all raised concerns about the details. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain ( .) and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry ( .) dismissed the budget proposal Monday as an insufficient step toward Trump’s pledge to shore up the military. “With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama’s budget,” McCain said in a statement. “We can and must do better. ” Some GOP appropriators, meanwhile, questioned whether nondefense cuts of that scale would be feasible. “There is more to our government than just defense,” said Rep. Mike Simpson ( ) chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development. “What are you going to do, go out and cut half of [National Institutes of Health] funding? That’s pretty popular not only in Congress but around the country. ” The early spending outline also crashed into concerns from conservatives who worried that Trump was focused on cutting spending from the relatively small pool of discretionary spending rather than concentrating on overhauling costly entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Those two mandatory programs made up nearly $1. 5 trillion in federal spending last year. The nondefense programs targeted by Trump cost $600 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Ryan has pledged to separately target Medicaid, which cost $588 billion last year. But that program pales in comparison to the   cost of administering the programs Trump has vowed to protect. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stoked those concerns Sunday when he said entitlement cuts were off the table in the upcoming spending blueprint. “We are not touching those now,” Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox News. “We are very focused on other aspects and that’s what’s very important to us. And that’s the president’s priority. ” Republicans in Congress have largely dismissed Trump’s pledge not to touch the programs. Many say Trump actually intends to support their plans for reform. Ryan suggested Tuesday that Trump agreed with his own assessment that Social Security and Medicare would ultimately have to be rolled back for younger Americans. “I believe he does,” he said on NBC. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi ( .) said Tuesday that he expects that Trump will turn his attention to a long debate on entitlements sometime after this budget is complete. “You can’t have someone who has just been in office for six weeks deciding on major things,” Enzi said. “It has to be part of a national discussion. ” Democratic leaders launched a preemptive attack against Trump on Monday and Tuesday in which they accused the president of breaking promises to   Americans to pursue divisive measures that will benefit the wealthy and “reckless” national security policies that undermine the country’s values and diminish its safety. “He talks like a populist, but governs like a       ideologue,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) on the Senate floor Tuesday.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) argued that Trump “utterly squandered” his first 40 days in office, focusing on a “brutal agenda to target vulnerable populations and instill fear” instead of providing economic relief for everyday Americans. She singled out the president’s controversial immigration ban, which has been halted by a federal court though the administration says it plans to reissue it. Schumer predicted Monday that infighting among Republicans and pressure from constituents will prevent the GOP from reaching its   goal of repealing and replacing the ACA. “I believe the odds are very high we will keep the ACA; it will not be repealed. ”  Read more at PowerPost  ",-0.5
"SpaceX says it will fly a spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018.      Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to land an unmanned spacecraft on Mars as soon as 2018 with the help of NASA, an extraordinary collaboration between the public and private sectors in an effort to eventually get humans to the Red Planet. SpaceX made the announcement on Twitter Wednesday, laying out an ambitious timeline for an incredibly difficult mission that only governments have dared try. Landing a spacecraft or a robot that can then operate successfully on the Martian surface is so difficult that the U. S. is the only country to have done it, and many attempts over the years have failed.    Planning to send Dragon to Mars as soon as 2018. Red Dragons will inform overall Mars architecture, details to come pic. twitter.   —   SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 27, 2016  The partnership between SpaceX and NASA, which has the goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s, is yet another example of the significant shift in the role NASA is playing in space exploration. While it continues to pursue its own deep space missions, the agency has also spent years, and billions of dollars, helping to support a robust commercial space industry, which it is increasingly partnering with to develop the technologies to explore the cosmos. In a statement, NASA said it is providing “technical support” for SpaceX’s mission, without financial support. In exchange, SpaceX would provide “valuable entry, descent and landing data to NASA for our journey to Mars, while providing support to American industry. ” Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who also runs the electric car maker Tesla, founded SpaceX more than 10 years ago with the goal of colonizing Mars. Getting to Mars, however, is exceedingly difficult. On average, it’s 140 million miles from Earth, though the planets come to within about 35 million miles every 26 months. But even under the best circumstances it takes months to get there. And the terrain of deep space is tremendously harsh. Skeptics think that despite its grand aspirations, NASA is nowhere close to getting humans there. And of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including flybys, attempted by four different countries, only 18 have been total successes. In 1971, the Soviet Union became the first country to successfully land a spacecraft on Mars when its Mars 3 lander transmitted for several seconds before going quiet. Musk’s announcement Wednesday, then, “is a pretty bold statement from a guy known for bold statements,” said Lori Garver, the former deputy NASA administrator. The collaboration “is more similar to what you might have with a    agreement,” she said. “So it is breaking new ground, and I think it’s a good sign that NASA is even a partner. It shows there are people at NASA who are as excited about this as a lot of us are. ” Once a spunky startup, SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif. has become a major force in the burgeoning space industry, with more than 4, 000 employees, a backlog of orders to launch commercial satellites and   dollar contracts with NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station on its Falcon 9 rocket.    In its first launch to resupply the International Space Station since its rocket exploded last year, Elon Musk’s SpaceX landed its unmanned rocket on a floating ’drone barge’ in the Atlantic Ocean. The landing, the first ever of a rocket’s first stage at sea, is seen as a breakthrough for commercial spaceflight. (Jorge   Washington Post)   Recently it pulled off feats once thought impossible —  the vertical landings of its Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage, one on a   pad at Cape Canaveral and another on a ship in the ocean. The accomplishments of recovering and reusing rockets that were normally discarded after each flight could help lower the cost of spaceflight. And the successes have reignited interest in space, which has seemed dormant since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011.    SpaceX landed the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on a droneship April 8, 2016 in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast. (Photo courtesy of SpaceX)  SpaceX is currently developing a new Dragon spacecraft that would be able to fly humans —  and not just cargo —  to the space station. It’s also working on a more powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy, which SpaceX says would become the world’s most powerful rocket with thrust at liftoff equivalent to 18 747 jetliners. On twitter, Musk said that the Dragon ”is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system.” But he said he wouldn’t recommend using it for missions beyond the moon because the inside is tight    about the size of a SUV. ”Wouldn’t be fun for longer journeys,” he wrote. On its website, SpaceX says that the Falcon Heavy rocket ”was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the moon or Mars.” The rocket is slated to launch for the first time later this year from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX is leasing the historic launch pad 39A, which launched many of the Apollo and space shuttle missions. John Logsdon, a noted space historian and a professor emeritus at George Washington University, said that SpaceX ”likes to do bravado things.” He noted that the company has yet to launch its Falcon Heavy, and it has yet to land its Dragon using its own engine thrust, a key component in landing in the Martian atmosphere. SpaceX pushes ”the limits of feasibility,” he said. ”To think that you can get this all together in two years since two of the key steps have not been demonstrated.” But he praised the company’s engineering prowess and said it was smart to partner with NASA. ”NASA has more expertise in getting to and landing on Mars than any other organization in the world,” he said. ”So if a U. S. company wants to try it on a     basis, why not?” In a blog post, NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman said that collaboration with industry and international partners is key to getting to Mars, and that the agency is reaching out to “partners in boardrooms, classrooms, laboratories, space agencies and even garages across our country and the world. ” While the Cold War competition between the U. S. and Soviet Union propelled NASA to the moon in the 1960s, there is a different tone today, she said. “In the international space community, gone are the days of the ‘space race’ when the dominant theme was that of various nations racing against each other,” she wrote. “Instead, we’re increasingly running together. ” For Musk, Mars has long been something of an obsession. Before he founded SpaceX, he was curious to know when NASA planned to send humans there, so he checked the agency’s website, he said at a conference a few years ago. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said at the time. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking. ” In an effort to drum up support for NASA and galvanize the public, he decided to buy a rocket and send a greenhouse to Mars, which would be the furthest life had traveled and the first living thing on Mars. But buying a rocket proved to be too difficult and expensive, and Musk decided he’d build them on his own. Musk, the   of PayPal, invested $100 million of his own money into SpaceX. Later this year, he is expected to lay out how SpaceX plans to fly humans to Mars. He has said he wants to colonize Mars so that humanity has a   plan in case anything should happen to Earth, such as an asteroid hitting it. At a recent conference he said he wants to go to Mars for “the defensive reason of protecting the future of humanity, ensuring that the light of consciousness is not extinguished should some calamity befall Earth. ” But what drives him most is what has drove generations of explorers before him, what NASA long stood for, which was, simply, “that this would be an incredible adventure. ”              Caption   Beautifully detailed images of the Martian surface.

"Student finds hilarious apology note after someone hit his car. Not even mad about the scratches lmfao  …    . .Hands down the funniest thing that has ever happened to me only in NewB 😭   —   Tcalloww (@TCalloww)  A mystery person person wrote a    —   but completely honest  —   apology after scratching up a college student’s car, admitting he penned the mea culpa only because there were eyewitnesses. Thomas Callow had just gotten out of an English exam last week at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts when he noticed a slip on his 2001 Chevy Malibu. “I forgot to pay the meter and left it there for two hours, so I thought it was a parking ticket,” he told The Post. “But then I was walking around the back and and saw the scratches and thought, ‘What the f —  k? ’” The    was surprised when he opened up the folded piece of paper and didn’t find the person’s insurance information. Instead, he found this: “Yo I hit your car. I’m leaving this note cause someone’s watching  …    They’re still looking  …     OK I’m good. My bad, n —   . Peace. ” After he read the note, his anger turned into a fit of laughter. “People were looking at me like I was crazy because I was laughing so hard, but I really couldn’t help it. It was hilarious,” he said, adding that it sounded like a stunt he would pull. He decided to tweet a picture of the damage to his car along with the note. “Not even mad about the scratches lmfao  …    . .Hands down the funniest thing that has even happened to me only in NewB,” he tweeted, referencing New Bedford, the town where the incident occurred. By the next morning, the tweet had gone viral and it now has more than 40, 000 retweets. Since he posted the picture last Thursday, one person has reached out to Callow claiming to be the person who damaged his car. Callow has no plans to get a paint job on his    ride. “I really don’t care,” he shrugged.",1.0
"No, there won’t be a major third-party candidacy in 2016 — from Bloomberg or anyone else.      Let’s face it: we in the media are suckers for any kind of political story that offers something unpredictable. And like clockwork, every four years someone suggests that there might be a viable   presidential candidacy in the offing, spurring legions of reporters and commentators to lick their lips in anticipation. At the moment the attention is focused on former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, but there is also discussion of whether conservatives might rally around a   candidate if Donald Trump, no true conservative he, becomes the GOP nominee. I have some bad news: It ain’t gonna happen. Not only is Bloomberg not going to run, but if Trump wins the Republican nomination, every last prominent Republican will line up behind him like good soldiers. Let’s start with Bloomberg. Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that he is thinking about running because he’s distressed at the thought of a race between the vulgarian Donald Trump and the socialistic Bernie Sanders. They made it sound like he’s really on his way to a bid: Mr. Bloomberg, 73, has already taken concrete steps toward a possible campaign, and has indicated to friends and allies that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his fortune on it, according to people briefed on his deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss his plans. He has set a deadline for making a final decision in early March, the latest point at which advisers believe Mr. Bloomberg could enter the race and still qualify to appear as an independent candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. He has retained a consultant to help him explore getting his name on those ballots, and his aides have done a detailed study of past   bids. Mr. Bloomberg commissioned a poll in December to see how he might fare against Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and he intends to conduct another round of polling after the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 to gauge whether there is indeed an opening for him, according to two people familiar with his intentions. You might read that and say, Holy cow, he’s doing it! But the thing about having $36. 5 billion is that you can explore lots of things without being serious about them. Bloomberg has political consultants who work for him, and he can open the paper one morning, decide he’s troubled by today’s news, then pick up the phone and say to one of those consultants, “Write me up a report on what it would take for me to run for president. ” Then they go off and do a poll, conduct a little research on ballot access, and put together a “plan” in a couple of weeks. Maybe it costs $100, 000 all told to satisfy the boss’s curiosity, but that’s nothing to Bloomberg. And he’s done it before. Here’s an almost identical article in the New York Times from eight years ago, about how he was laying the groundwork for a   run. Practically the only thing that’s different is the date. You might say, “Hey, nobody thought Trump was going to run, either!” Which is true. But Trump found an opening in one of the two parties, and Bloomberg hasn’t suggested running as a Democrat. While I’m sure Bloomberg thinks he’d be an excellent president, he’s also smart enough to know that unlike in New York, where he could swamp the field with money and circumvent the Democratic Party’s dominance in the city, running a national   campaign is a different matter altogether. It’s no accident that there hasn’t been a successful   presidential candidacy in modern American history. The closest anyone came was Teddy Roosevelt’s run in 1912, when he got 27 percent of the vote. In 1992, Ross Perot managed 19 percent of the vote  —   and zero votes in the Electoral College. Perot offers us a hint as to why the talk from some Republicans about a   run is just that, talk. It has come most notably from Bill Kristol, who has been toying with the idea in public for a couple of months now, on the theory that if Donald Trump is the nominee, true conservatives would simply have to find an ideologically true   to promote. Given the horror many conservatives are expressing at the prospect of a Trump nomination, you might be tempted to think they’d sign on to any conservative who decided to run. But don’t believe it for a second. Are those conservatives heartfelt in their anguish about Trump being the GOP nominee? Absolutely. It’s not just that he’d probably lose, it’s that he obviously has no commitment to their ideals; he’s just saying whatever his current audience wants to hear, and once that audience changes (as in a general election) he’ll say completely different things. And who knows how he’d actually govern. And yet, if he is the nominee, Republicans will be faced with a choice. They could launch a   bid, but that would almost certainly guarantee that the Democratic nominee would win. Republicans long ago convinced themselves that Perot delivered the 1992 election to Bill Clinton (even though the evidence makes clear that Perot took votes equally from Bush and Clinton, who won easily and would have done so with or without Perot in the race) so they’d be extremely skittish about repeating that outcome. Far more importantly, if they have to choose between supporting their party’s nominee and mounting an almost certainly doomed   run, their feelings about Donald Trump will be far less critical than their feelings about the Democratic nominee, who will probably be Hillary Clinton  —   for whom they’ve nurtured a passionate loathing for two and a half decades now. We live in an era of “negative partisanship,” in which people’s hatred for the other party has become more central to their political identity than their love for their own party. Faced with the imminent possibility of Clinton sitting in the Oval Office, virtually every Republican will race to get behind Trump. Those now writing articles about what a nightmare a Trump nomination would be will be writing articles touting his virtues. They won’t be dissembling  —   rather, they’ll just be trying to make the best of a bad situation. Once the point of reference is not a more preferable Republican but Hillary Clinton, Trump will look to them like a hero in the making. So as fun as a   presidential race in the fall might be, we in the media won’t be so fortunate. But don’t worry  —   it’s still going to be an interesting election.  ",-0.5
"Trump’s inaugural cake was commissioned to look exactly like Obama’s, baker says.      Amid the glitz of President Trump’s inaugural festivities, one item stood out in particular late Friday night: a spectacular   cake that the new president and Vice President Pence cut into with a sword. To pastry chef Duff Goldman, the cake seemed a little too familiar  —   because it looked almost exactly like one he had made years earlier for Barack Obama’s second inauguration as president. Just after midnight, the Food Network personality posted a    comparison of two cakes on his Twitter account. On the left, Goldman wrote in the caption, was the cake he had created for the “  ” inaugural ball in 2013. The one on the right was the cake that had just appeared at Trump’s “Salute to Our Armed Services” ball. It appeared nearly identical to Goldman’s cake from four years ago, right down to the colors, the patriotic bunting, and the placement of several small silver stars and seals. “I didn’t make it,” Goldman wrote about Trump’s cake, adding a suspicious   emoji at the end.   The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama’s inauguration 4 years ago. The one on the right is Trumps. I didn’t make it. 🤔 pic. twitter.   —   Duff Goldman (@Duff_Goldman) January 21, 2017   Neither Goldman nor representatives from Trump’s transition and inauguration teams responded to requests for comment Saturday morning, but Tiffany MacIsaac, owner of Washington’s Buttercream Bakeshop, stepped forward to say she had been the one to create the    cake.   [The Maggie Austin LaBaugh cakes that look like another baker’s? ‘An homage. ’]   She said that the order came in while she was out of town, and that the client had brought in a photo of the cake from Obama’s inauguration asking her to   it. “They came to us a couple of weeks ago, which is pretty last minute, and said ‘We have a photo that we would like to replicate,’ ” MacIsaac told The Washington Post by phone. Her bakery tried to encourage the client to use the photo as “inspiration,” as they do with many others, she said. “They said, ‘Nope, they want this exact cake. It’s perfect.’ And we said, great,” MacIsaac said. Neither she nor her spokeswoman revealed who placed the order. The “Salute to Our Troops” ball was one of three official presidential inaugural balls held Friday and open by invitation only to members of the military, veterans, first responders and their families.      Excited to share the cake we got to make for one of last night’s inaugural balls. While we most love creating original designs, when we are asked to replicate someone else’s work we are thrilled when it is a masterpiece like this one. @duff_goldman originally created this for Obama’s inauguration 4 years ago and this years committee commissioned us to   it. Best part is all the profits are being donated to @humanrightscampaign, one of our favorite charities who we have loved working with over the years. Because basic human rights are something every man, woman and child~ straight, gay or the rainbow in between~ deserve! A photo posted by Buttercream Bakeshop (@bttrcrmbakeshop) on Jan 21, 2017 at 7:35am PST    MacIsaac did not want to state her political affiliation, but said her bakery began planning how it would donate its proceeds from the Trump inaugural cake to charity. The baker and her staff chose the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal treatment of the LGBT community  —   and that has declared Trump “unfit for the presidency. ” “I’m a   owner and one of the things I’m very, very proud about is that I don’t discriminate,” MacIsaac said. “I would never turn someone away based on their age, their sex, their sexual orientation, their political views. It’s just not the way we operate. ” MacIsaac said the attention caught her by surprise partly because, per the order, the Trump cake was intended to be more of a prop: All but a   slice at the bottom was inedible. “It’s just a Stryofoam cake. It’s not for eating,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting it to be seen on TV. ” As is customary with many of her creations, MacIsaac posted a photo of the   cake on Instagram the day after the event. By then, Goldman’s tweet  —   and controversy over the cake  —   had found its way to her. “Obviously, my intention was definitely not to upset him in any way,” MacIsaac said of Goldman, whom she does not know personally. “I just wish that it had not been presented the way that it was. ” Goldman, who founded Charm City Cakes in Baltimore and Los Angeles, is known for his showstopping cake creations. From 2006 to 2011, the Food Network reality show “Ace of Cakes” followed Goldman as he ran his bakery and pulled out all the stops to construct elaborate cakes. These days, the celebrity pastry chef is better known to   bakers as “Chef Duff” as one of the judges on the network’s “Kids Baking Championship. ” Later Saturday, Goldman posted to Twitter again, with an apparent change of heart. “Remembering a fantastic cake I made is awesome and the chef that   it for @POTUS Trump did a fantastic job,” he tweeted. “Group hug, y’all. ”   Remembering a fantastic cake I made is awesome and the chef that   it for @POTUS Trump did a fantastic job. Group hug, y’all. 🇺🇸  —   Duff Goldman (@Duff_Goldman) January 21, 2017   In 2013, Goldman told The Post’s Tim Carman he wanted Obama’s inaugural cake to be perfect. “When you’re doing a cake like this, you know that everybody is going to be looking at it,” Goldman said. “It’s a lot of pressure. The more recognition you get for something that you do, the greater the pressure becomes, because more people are looking for a mistake. So you really gotta make sure your work is  . ” Goldman described his cake for Obama to The Post in great detail then: The      cake was meant to pay special homage to the nation’s armed forces, with seals of the five branches military. The different tiers would each be of different flavors, from red velvet to   chip. Though he expressed some anxiety about pulling off the cake in 2013, Goldman ultimately delivered on his vision. “It was our honor to create this cake for last night’s    Ball  —   an experience we will never forget,” the Charm City Cakes Facebook page noted with a picture of the cake the day after Obama’s 2013 inauguration. (For the record, Obama has said he is more of a pie person.)   [This Trump victory cake will haunt your dreams]   Allegations of plagiarism are not new in Trump’s nascent administration. During his transition, Trump aide Monica Crowley said she would not take a national security communications post after charges she had plagiarized several passages in her 2012 book. And the president’s spouse, Melania Trump, was accused of lifting a portion of her speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention from one Michelle Obama gave at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. And shortly after Donald Trump gave his inaugural address on Friday, some thought that a small part of his speech sounded quite similar to words uttered by the Batman villain Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises. ” It was not even the first time a celebratory cake for Trump had made headlines. On Election Day, a large bust of his head  —   in cake form  —   was carted into Trump Tower for his victory party. The jarring image set Twitter afire.

"Whiteness History Month is a great idea. Here are 7 ways to observe it..      There are few words in the American lexicon that can bring a conversation to a quicker and more unproductive end than “whiteness. ” Invoke it negatively and you’ll be accused of reverse racism, attempting to impugn your fellow citizens as a way to build up members of other racial and ethnic groups. Bring up whiteness with a spritely air of positivity and you risk associating yourself with a long and ugly history of a violent obsession with racial purity. These conversational conventions are extremely convenient if your goal is to keep anyone from talking about the fact that white people haven’t always been around forever, and they haven’t always looked the way they’re assumed to today. But these conventions are fundamentally dishonest, and frankly, more than a little immature. And these rules went into predictable motion this week when conservative publications pounced on Portland Community College for a piece of student programming called Whiteness History Month.   [Why one Oregon college is planning a “Whiteness History Month”]   The folks at Campus Reform declared, “Portland Community College to devote an entire month to ‘whiteness’” and the Daily Caller summarized the project in similarly skeptical terms. Never mind that the event is the project of a committee of the Cascade Campus Diversity Council. And never mind that the program actually seems like an alternative to the protests that swept many American college campuses last fall, encouraging students to get in dialogue with each other rather than demanding revolutionary change from university administrators. The same old dynamic clicked into place. But while the proposal has some of the standard jargon that so often pops up in college settings  —   and maybe telegraphs its assumptions a little too cleanly  —   treating whiteness as a subject of study is an entirely sensible idea. Figuring out where whiteness came from, and who came to be included in it, is the story of how America assimilated some of its immigrants, failed disastrously to navigate its regional differences and managed a tricky balance between the classes. Most students have studied whiteness in some form or other in high school or college, even if it wasn’t called that. And while the Cascade Campus Diversity Council will have to figure out its own programming, here are some books, movies, and essay and short story collections that could get the group started.   [White privilege, explained]   1. “The History of White People,” by Nell Irvin Painter: Painter’s 2010 book is a perfect starting place for this conversation. She meticulously traces the way different societies have sorted people into racial and ethnic groups as far back as ancient Greece and examines how race theory has affected everything from practices in art preservation to early American census categories. Painter also looks at the way whiteness evolved in America to incorporate new members, its boundaries determined by class and geography. “Today’s Americans, bred in the ideology of skin color as racial difference, find it difficult to recognize the historical coexistence of potent American hatreds against people accepted as white, Irish Catholics,” Painter writes. “Hatred of black people did not preclude hatred of other white people —  those considered different and inferior —  and   of deadly violence against stigmatized whites. ” 2. “Goodbye, Columbus,” by Philip Roth: Speaking of stigmatized whites, or ethnic groups who gradually were incorporated into whiteness, let’s talk Jews! This collection of a novella and short stories, controversial when it was published in 1959, is a great look at a generation of Jewish Americans making the leap from ethnic Jewish enclaves into more assimilated lives. Roth’s portraits of a Hebrew school student who gets in trouble for his theological inquiries; a Jewish army officer who resists appeals to tribal solidarity; and the uneasiness a group of Jews living among Gentiles feels about a newly opened Orthodox synagogue may have gotten Roth tarred as  . But they address plenty of issues that remain relevant to American Jews today as we address everything from rising secularism to the U. S. relationship with Israel. 3. “The Godfather,” and “The Godfather: Part II,” by Francis Ford Coppola: Part of what’s fascinating about Coppola’s first masterpiece about the Corleones is the way it captures an Italian extended family at a moment when its members are struggling to define themselves both in relation to   Protestants and to African Americans. As Don Corelone (Marlon Brando) tells his son Michael (Al Pacino) “I thought that when it was your time, that you would be the one to hold the strings. Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. ” And it’s not simply that he hoped Michael would be a big shot, but that he would be freed from the family crime business and the ethnic associations that might hold Michael back from the pursuit of power. By contrast, as the heads of the various crime families discuss their move into the drug trade, there’s a telling moment when Don Zaluchi (Louis Guss) draws a racial distinction about that particular underground industry. “I don’t want it near schools! I don’t want it sold to children! That’s an infamia,” he tells the other dons. “In my city, we would keep the traffic in the dark people, the coloreds. They’re animals anyway, so let them lose their souls. ” Zaluchi and his compatriots may not yet think of themselves as white rather than Italian, but they are clearly trying to distinguish themselves from African Americans. These tensions only become more fraught in the second film, as Michael gets closer to legitimacy, but still has to deal with senators who see all Italians as corrupted, Italians who see him as a traitor for dealing with Jews, and a dying regime in Cuba. Bonus reading: “Are Italians White?” 4. “How the Irish Became White,” by Noel Ignatiev: That Irish immigrants to the United States would eventually become white wasn’t a foregone conclusion. Ignatiev reaches back to the early years of the country to look at everything from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia to the interaction between internal Irish politics and emerging regional politics in America to explore the ways Irish Americans found their place in their adopted country’s evolving racial schema. “The Irish who emigrated to America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were fleeing caste oppression and a system of landlordism that made the material conditions of the Irish peasant comparable to those of an American slave. They came to a society in which color was important in determining social position. It was not a pattern they were familiar with and they bore no responsibility for it; nevertheless, they adapted to it in short order,” Ignatiev writes. “In antebellum America it was speculated that if racial amalgamation was ever to take place it would begin between those two groups. As we know, things turned out otherwise. ” 5. “Gone With the Wind,” by Margaret Mitchell: Ignatiev brings an academic perspective to the role of the Irish in America. But Mitchell’s novel about Scarlett O’Hara, the oldest daughter of an Irish immigrant who married into Southern aristocracy and built a great   plantation in Georgia, only to see his work devastated by the Civil War, brings an emotional heft to Ignatiev’s dry facts. “Gone With the Wind” has long been controversial, but in this context, it’s essential reading. Mitchell captures the complex dynamics between immigrants, old Southern families and   “white trash,” the evolving ideal of Southern womanhood and how it helped defined the borders between the races, and the way class pride influenced Georgians’ sense of their racial and regional identities in reconstruction. You don’t have to admire Mitchell’s worldview to benefit from her  . 6. “The Wages of Whiteness,” by David R. Roediger: Of course, whiteness isn’t only a way of mediating the place of immigrants in America. It has also been an identity shaped in response to class conflict. Labor historian David Roediger, who has written his own book on the way European immigrants assimilated into whiteness as it’s defined in America, argues here that race was a way to sort out who could compete for certain jobs and wages and looks at the psychological needs that a racial identity fills for white   people. “Much of that reflection led back to what my early years might have taught me: the role of race in defining how white workers look not only at Blacks but at themselves; the pervasiveness of race; the complex mixture of hate, sadness and longing in the racist thought of white workers; the relationship between race and ethnicity,” Roediger wrote in a new introduction to the book, explaining how his own life informed his research as a historian. “My question at age eighteen was why friends wanted to be white and why I didn’t. ” 7. “Django Unchained,” by Quentin Tarantino: I am not, by inclination, much of a Tarantino person  —   I have only so much stomach for ultraviolence. But I’ve long thought that Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a fascinating figure and one highly relevant to this conversation. When Schultz arrives in “Django Unchained,” he thinks of himself purely in individual terms. But by the end of the film, he has been awakened to the brutality of American racism and is eager to distinguish himself from the white people who practice slavery. That Schultz’s blow against white supremacy comes in a fashion that is ultimately suicidal and unhelpful to Django (Jamie Foxx) who is attempting to rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) only makes this portrayal more interesting. As a bonus, of course, it might be fascinating to consider Tarantino along with his work. Tarantino is Italian American; he has given actors of color, including Samuel L. Jackson, Pam Grier, Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and Foxx and Washington fascinating roles; and he has marched against police brutality. But Tarantino is also infamous for his characters’ use of one of the ugliest racial epithets in the American lexicon. I don’t know that Tarantino represents anyone other than himself. But he’s an intriguing study in how a white person defines what’s acceptable for himself to do, and for how he imagines American racial history and himself as a mediator of it.",-0.5
"Poll: women have harsher attitudes toward prostitution than men.  Women judge prostitution more harshly than men and are more likely to think it should be illegal, according to a new YouGov poll.    The poll asked Americans about their attitudes toward sex work, including whether they have ever personally bought or sold sex. (If they’re answering honestly, apparently 6 percent of both men and women have sold sex, while 12 percent of men and 1 percent of women have bought it.) A slight majority of men (51 percent) think working as a prostitute should be legal, while almost as many women (50 percent) think it should be illegal. The numbers were similar on paying for sex (50 percent of men think it should be legal and 52 percent of women think it should be illegal). The poll also found that more women than men think working as a prostitute is morally wrong (65 percent versus 47 percent).            Put together, slightly more Americans think prostitution should be illegal (43 percent) than legal (40 percent).    More Republicans (52 percent) than Democrats (45 percent) or independents (37 percent) think it should be illegal to accept money for sex. There wasn’t a huge difference across age divides, though people under 30 were actually more likely than older generations to think buying or selling sex should be illegal. What should we think about these results? It’s easy to look at this poll and laugh about how of course most men want to legalize sex work.    But it might be more interesting to think about why women think it should be illegal. Is it Mean Girls —  style judgment of promiscuous women? Is it a desire to protect other women from exploitation? It’s hard to say what exactly lies behind this gender gap. It’s indisputable, however, that sex work is the subject of bitter divides in the feminist community. Some think sex work is exploitation no matter what, even for the women (or men) who choose that work. Others think this view is both patronizing and dangerous to people who willingly engage in sex work. Moral quandaries aside, though, the evidence shows that banning sex work is counterproductive. When sex work is illegal and has to operate in the shadows, sex workers are at greater risk for exploitation and abuse. After examining the research on decriminalizing prostitution, Vox’s German Lopez concluded that sex work should be decriminalized and regulated like other businesses.    Decriminalization has major public health benefits like reduced rates of rape and sexually transmitted infections. Meanwhile the evidence in favor of prohibition  —   like the argument that legalized prostitution increases sex trafficking  —   is badly flawed. In fact, legalizing prostitution might even decrease demand for illegal sex trafficking. Interestingly, most Americans don’t agree with harsh punishment for sex work or solicitation. Only 20 percent think that either buying or selling sex should be punished with prison. The rest think community service or a small fine would suffice, or aren’t sure. But that’s a far cry from how sex work is punished in the real world, both legally and in less official ways. In most states, sex work can be punished with at least some jail time and fines of up to $1, 000 or more. The penalties are harsher for pimps and brothel owners. Georgia is trying to make prostitution solicitation a felony. But social and legal stigma can inflict the most horrifying punishments of all. Sex workers face constant police harassment, risk losing custody of their children, and are murdered at alarming rates. Society thinks sex workers’ lives are worth less, and acts accordingly. ",-1.0

The question was raised by a caller into the show. “How about you stepping up your game and leading by example [by] getting out of your SUV armada?” said the caller, Charles Komanoff, a longtime   expert from Manhattan and a Carbon Tax Center founder. “And if you need to go to the Park Slope Y five days a week rather than a gym near you, why don’t you take mass transit or even once in a while ride a bike like the vast majority of your fellow New Yorkers so you will know how we are suffering under a transit system?” De Blasio defended his rides by noting that his SUV is a “ ” hybrid. “I wish my life was like everyone else’s, but it’s not, for obvious reasons. But again, the issue is not cheap symbolism here. The issue is, Are we going to take action? Are we going to change the way things are done?” he said. The mayor is ferried to the Y by two SUVs  —   a regular GMC Yukon XL, which burns 16 mpg in the city, and a Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid, which is only slightly more fuel efficient at 20 mpg. De Blasio also suggested the city would start cracking down on idling cars  —   even though his own fleet has been caught waiting with their engines on for up to an hour outside the gym. “Idling is a huge problem, and blocking the box is huge problem,” the mayor said. “I will have more to say on that in the coming weeks. ” Komanoff, who said he voted for de Blasio in the last election, later told The Post he was “appalled” by the mayor’s “tone deaf” reply to his question. “This whole ‘tale of two cities’ thing  —   I guess he really fancies himself as one of the little guys,” he said, invoking de Blasio’s campaign theme. “Most of us are little guys, and no one looks on him as one of us when he gets ferried everywhere in his armada. ” He said the mayor’s   trips to the gym set a bad example. “This is what makes the climate issue such an easy mark for the right wing,” he said. “It’s so easy to characterize this [as an issue] the elites drag out to make the common person feel bad for driving around in a pickup truck. ”",1.0
