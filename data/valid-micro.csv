"VHacks: Inside the Vatican's First-Ever Hackathon. This past weekend, tourists milled around St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the holiest sites in the world, snapping selfies and experiencing Michelangelo's art through their phone’s camera lens. A few hundred meters away, in a 500-year-old palazzo, 120 students coded for 36 hours straight at the Vatican’s first-ever hackathon. This, it would seem, is the Holy See of the 21st century. “When I heard about it, I thought it was a joke. Vatican, hackathon—it didn’t add up,” says John Franklin, a senior at Northwestern University who found out about VHacks, the event's official name, while participating in another hackathon in 2017. It wasn’t until he saw the event’s themes—creating technological solutions for encouraging social inclusion, promoting interfaith dialogue, and providing resources to migrants and refugees—that he realized it was not only real, but something he wanted to take part in. “I thought, ‘This is unique,’” he says. Cardinals dropped in to speak to the students—and tool around with VR goggles. ""This event is a part of a long history of the relationship the Vatican has with science, technology, and faith.""

"Zuckerberg Defends Free Speech, Even When the Speech is False. It wasn’t long after Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Aspen Ideas Festival Wednesday that he was heckled by the audience. Facebook’s CEO was talking to Cass Sunstein, the Harvard Law School professor who has also served as a Facebook adviser, and discussing the complexities of combatting election interference. One problem, Zuckerberg proclaimed, is that Facebook doesn’t have a mechanism for deterring foreign governments from running influence operations. It can take down posts; it can delete fake accounts; but it can’t cut the internet connections of Russia’s Internet Research Agency. “As a private company, we don’t have the tools to make the Russian government stop,” he declared. “Our government is the one that has the tools to apply pressure to Russia, not us.” As he spoke, an elderly voice hollered from the back, “Not true!” The moment was symbolic for Zuckerberg and the trust he and his company have lost in recent years. The Aspen Ideas Festival is a quiet, thoughtful place. Heckling is rare. But Facebook has drawn anger and derision everywhere this year, even at thought-leader conferences in the mountains. Still, Zuckerberg soldiered on, making his point, which happens to be largely true. ",0.0
"Fitbit Premium, Versa 2, Aria Air: Pricing, Specs, Details. As the fitness tracker market matures, it’s gotten easier to differentiate which wearable you should get depending on your lifestyle and needs. If you want to ski the backcountry or run a faster marathon, you get a Garmin or a Suunto; if you own an iPhone, an Apple Watch. If you're on a budget, you should probably get a Fitbit. With its latest round of offerings, Fitbit is attempting to upend that customer calculation. Today, Fitbit is launching Fitbit Premium, a paid subscription service that analyzes the huge amount of data collected from its 27 million active users to dispense daily, personalized recommendations meant to optimize each user's activity, sleep, and fitness. Fitbit is also debuting the Versa 2, an updated version of the company's hugely popular smartwatch, and the Aria Air, an affordable smart scale. Fitbit has peppered both devices and the app with collaborations, from its existing partnerships with Spotify and Solera Health to newer ones with such varied entities as the meditation app Headspace and rescue beacon manufacturer Recco. Eventually, you may find yourself using a Fitbit just because it seems inconvenient not to. In September, both old and new Fitbit users will be offered a limited free trial of Fitbit Premium. The new subscription service dispenses health advice via nine guided programs, including ways to understand your caloric intake, a program to eliminate salt from your diet, and a program to promote healthy sleep habits. Fitbit Premium will be available as both a $10 monthly subscription and as an $80 annual subscription. While many fitness trackers already offer generalized advice gleaned from third-party organizations and university studies, Fitbit Premium will layer those recommendations with personalized data. For example, a Fitbit Premium subscriber might become discouraged that they’re not making any headway on their weight-loss efforts. However, their premium updates might show that their resting heart rate dropped two beats below their previous monthly average, which is a significant improvement that won’t show up on a scale. Fitbit's new smart scale, called the Aria Air, will cost just $50. In addition to personalized recommendations and fitness challenges, Fitbit Premium will also give users the option to access a certified health and wellness coach. This coach will have access to the user’s granular health data and, in addition to making personalized recommendations, will also be able to help manage conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Finally, Fitbit Premium subscribers will also be able to distill accumulated data in one easy-to-read, printable report that will be developed in conjunction with medical professionals. Rather than relying on their faulty memory during meetings with doctors or nutritionists, subscribers can hand their doctor a piece of paper with a summary of relevant data, like activity graphs or weight loss trends. Fitbit has long partnered with some of the biggest healthcare insurers in the country, like Blue Cross Blue Shield, to provide users with activity trackers at a discount. That prospect is made more attractive with affordable devices, like Fitbit's popular Versa wearable. Earlier this year, Fitbit stripped the Versa Lite of its extraneous features, like the altimeter, in order to lower the price tag. This fall’s Versa 2 is a return to the higher price range ($200) but it also promises a more premium experience. For the first time, the Versa 2 won’t have a neatly inscribed “fitbit” on the bezel. It will also have a brighter AMOLED display, an onboard microphone, and a variety of subdued, tasteful finishes and woven straps. Wear your Fitbit to bed, and it will award you a Sleep Score commensurate with your snoozing efforts. Sleep Score—a feature I beta-tested which tracks factors like your restlessness and time spent awake to give you a single metric that tells you if you slept well or not—will be available to all Fitbit users who have a heart-rate tracking device. The app will also include other sleep features, like smart wake, which will awaken you while you are in light or REM sleep versus deep sleep, making for an easier start to your day. The Versa 2 will also be Alexa-enabled; you can also use voice-to-text, if you have an Android phone. I'm especially excited to see an optional always-on mode, so that you won’t have to constantly shake or tap the device to wake it up while you’re running or discreetly checking the time during a meeting. And Fitbit's latest smart scale, the Aria Air, is Bluetooth-enabled, will wirelessly sync with the Fitbit app, and will be provided for free to members by health management company Solera Health. Most importantly, at $50, it will be one of the more affordable smart scales on the market, and much cheaper than Fitbit's previous one, the $130 Aria 2. While Fitbit claims its focus is on comprehensive and accessible health care, its partnerships extend way beyond those with doctors and insurance providers. On your new Versa 2, you can also access your Spotify Premium account and use Fitbit Pay to pay your fare on a Staten Island bus. You can accessorize your wearable with a band designed by Kim Shui, who worked with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. You can swap in a band from Recco Technology, which makes avalanche and rescue beacons for when your backcountry adventure takes a turn. It's easy to see these myriad partnerships, and the downward slide of its device pricing, as frantic flailing from a company that has struggled with falling sales in the past few years. It's also hard to ignore that Fitbit seems to be hitching all its hopes to a wagon that bears a marked resemblance to its closest competitor, the Apple Watch. But truthfully, I enjoyed testing the last two versions of the Versa and am looking forward to this one. Rather than building its own exclusive walled garden, Fitbit is keeping its products affordable and reaching out to the apps, designers and doctors that you, the potential user, already love. As the millions of Fitbit users can attest, maybe the most important piece of fitness equipment is other people.",0.0
"Washington’s new normal: A Trump protest spectacle a day.  We began Wednesday morning with the sight of Greenpeace activists scaling a   construction crane in downtown Washington and unfurling a gigantic orange and black banner that bore the message: “RESIST. ” We ended the day with several hundred protesters marching to the White House to condemn President Trump’s executive order on immigration. Welcome to Trump’s capital. It’s a spectacle a day here.    anarchists swarmed through downtown D. C. on Trump’s Inauguration Day, torching a limousine, smashing   glass and vandalizing businesses. Then hundreds of thousands of people massed on the Mall the following day for the Women’s March on Washington, waving clever and sometimes scathing signs aimed at the new commander in chief: “There Is So Much Wrong It Cannot Fit on This Sign” and “We Want a Leader, Not a Creepy Tweeter. ”  [At the Women’s March, the men mattered, too]  Coming Friday: The annual March for Life, which will bring tens of thousands of newly energized antiabortion demonstrators to the nation’s front yard.   Hundreds of thousands of protesters converged for the Women’s March on Washington the day after President Trump’s inauguration. (Oliver   The Washington Post)  Even the country’s scientists are planning a march on Washington. Meetings? Deadlines? Schedules? All plans are soft in the District, a city where people chanting in the streets or rappelling off construction cranes bring traffic to a halt. The working world is feeling it. #Thisisnotnormal. I have to confess that I’ve always been a street protest skeptic. This comes from decades of covering protests. I’ve   marched backward for miles, interviewing people about apartheid, gay rights, abortion, Rodney King, racism, Palestine, globalization, layoffs, public dancing, the World Bank, female genital mutilation, women’s rights, the death penalty, homelessness and war after war. I’ve slept in the bushes to hang with the protesters, I’ve been in the control rooms as police chiefs strategize riot control. Yet I’ll never forget talking with the banker in his crisp suit and   office, looking out the window at the protesters below and just laughing, laughing, laughing. Because he knew they’d eventually be gone and nothing would change. That reality dulled the power of protest for me. Even one of the founders of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which spread to 82 countries and had millions of people in the streets, agreed with my assessment.    A limousine was set ablaze by   anarchists protesting Trump’s inauguration. (Matt   Washington Post)  “The end of protest is the proliferation of ineffective protests that are more like a ritualized performance of children than a mature, revolutionary challenge to the status quo,” said Micah White, who wrote “The End of Protest  —   A New Playbook for Revolution” after the Occupy movement had the world’s attention, then sputtered and stalled in a pile of ragged tents and trashed city parks. “Activists who rush into the streets tomorrow and repeat yesterday’s tired tactics will not bring an end to Trump nor will they transfer sovereign power to the people,” White wrote. “There are only two ways to achieve sovereignty in this world. Activists can win elections or win wars. There is no third option. ” But this time feels different. Keep it up, protesters, because this time, it’s working. You’re getting to him.  [Where was Donald Trump when John Lewis was fighting for civil rights? Let’s compare.]  This daily public humiliation  —   the massive, televised rejection of the direction of this administration  —   Donald Trump cares about that. The war hawks didn’t care. The bankers didn’t care. The party   didn’t care. But Trump cares. He’s a showman, a ringmaster, a ratings junkie. And nothing angers an attention addict more than a bigger, louder show next door. This is Trump’s language. It’s not going to change policy, but it will rankle and distract him. And it will signal to the rest of the world that most of America isn’t on board the lying train to Absurdistan. The letters and calls to Congress, the preparation for 2018 elections and the   participation in all levels of the democratic process are ultimately the only path to real change. But meanwhile, the protests will be effective if they’re peaceful, on point and relentless. Remember all those   vandals arrested in Oregon who didn’t even vote? Nope. Can’t do that again. And no more torching limos. The one that was set ablaze on K Street in front of The Washington Post belonged to a Muslim immigrant who has no idea if his insurance will cover the tens of thousands of dollars of damage. And the   riding in it just called another one. Here’s my protest prescription:   activists need go to every single Trump hotel in this country and around the world and set up legal, peaceful,    vigils. Occupy them day and night. Take shifts, don’t leave. Make it really uncomfortable to stay there. Oh, he’ll see that. And it will infuriate him. This should be the new normal. This time, it will work.

"The Cassini spacecraft’s dive in between Saturn’s rings, explained.  The Cassini spacecraft is going where no ship has gone before: On Wednesday, it begins a series of dives into the space between Saturn and its magnificent rings. The maneuver  —   a series of 22 orbits that will bring Cassini increasingly closer to Saturn’s surface before crashing into it  —   is called the spacecraft’s “grand finale. ” And to mark this final journey, Cassini is being honored with a Google Doodle.     Over its last 13 years in orbit, Cassini has had an amazing run studying Saturn and its moons. Here’s what the spacecraft has taught us so far  —   and why its final mission may be its most spectacular yet.  In its last days, Cassini keeps generating fascinating insights Cassini  —   named after the   astronomer Giovanni Cassini  —   launched from Cape Canaveral in October 1997 in collaboration with the European Space Agency. When it launched, we were still a few months away from Bill Clinton’s damning “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” remark. Harry Potter had not yet been published in the United States. From there, it took Cassini and the Huygens lander (destined to touch down on the moon Titan) seven years to reach Saturn. Once it arrived, it started to make impressive discoveries.     On Titan, Cassini and Huygens revealed surprisingly Earthlike geographic features and great lakes of liquid natural gas on the moon’s surface that outweigh all the oil and gas reserves on Earth. Cassini found evidence of an underground ocean on the moon Enceladus. It learned how new moons could form out of Saturn’s rings. And it has taken detailed, beautiful photographic surveys of the planet’s rings and surface features.            Nearing the end of its life, Cassini is still producing scientific discoveries at a fast clip.     Earlier in April, NASA announced that the spacecraft had found the most compelling evidence yet that the ocean underneath Enceladus could contain life.     Previously, the Cassini spacecraft has observed jets of water containing organic chemicals streaming from Enceladus. This latest finding adds a key ingredient for life to the mix: hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen in the jets makes NASA scientists suspect there are geothermal geysers on Enceladus’s ocean floor. Like the geothermal vents deep within Earth’s oceans, these could be home to microbes that use the chemical energy of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane and energy for life.  Now Cassini is beginning a series of harrowing orbits that bring it into the space between Saturn and its rings  —   a region no spacecraft has been before. When Cassini is in the inner rings, it will finally be able to take the measurements that will aid in calculations to determine the mass of the rings. Why NASA is diving into the space between Saturn and its rings On Wednesday, Cassini begins a maneuver that is unprecedented in the history of spaceflight: It’s adjusting its trajectory to bring it inside the    gap between Saturn and its rings for 22 orbits.     This is what that dive will look like from Cassini’s perspective.                                     In these illustrations, the blue lines represent each of the 22 orbits getting closer and closer to the atmosphere of the giant planet. The red line represents the final orbit, which will end with Cassini crashing into Saturn’s atmosphere.                         In this space, Cassini will be able to take new measurements to better determine the total mass of Saturn’s rings. NASA already knows the mass of Saturn plus its rings. Getting closer to the planet will allow Cassini to take its mass without factoring in the rings. That information will help scientists better understand how the rings formed (which in turn can help them understand how all the planets formed from rings of material around the sun).  The orbits will also produce the   observations of Saturn’s clouds  —   yielding incredible images.  It will be a thrilling journey, but also a perilous one. NASA has saved the   orbits for Cassini’s finale in part because they are dangerous. The orbits will bring Cassini close to debris and rocks that could take it offline.  “We’re going out in a blaze of glory”              Come September 15, Cassini will crash into Saturn, having spent all of its fuel. But the death dive isn’t just for fireworks. If the spacecraft doesn’t plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere, it runs the risk of potentially contaminating one of the planet’s moons with debris and microbes from Earth.    And there’s no turning back: “The spacecraft is now on a ballistic path,” Earl Maize, a Cassini project manager, said in a press statement, meaning that the spacecraft’s path is shaped mostly by gravity, not by thrusters. “Even if we were to forgo future small course adjustments using thrusters, we would still enter Saturn’s atmosphere on Sept. 15 no matter what. ” Cassini’s dramatic finale is also a last chance to squeeze some more insights out of the    spacecraft. As it descends into Saturn’s atmosphere, “several of the instruments will be on,” including the mass spectrometer, Preston Dyches, a NASA spokesperson, says. This instrument essentially can “sniff” the atmosphere and determine the chemical compounds it’s composed of. On April 12, days before it made its final flyby of Titan, Cassini captured this incredible image of Earth shining through Saturn’s rings, as if to remind us of how far it’s come since beginning its journey. From Saturn, we’re just a tiny bright speck in the darkness.          When Cassini finally goes offline in September, it will die doing what it’s been doing all along: exploring. ",-1.0

"Mets lurk in Yoenis Cespedes market with short-term bucks. Think of Yoenis Cespedes as baseball’s version of Powerball.

If for some reason Cespedes does not take the Orioles’ deal, and wants to bet on himself on a   deal with the hopes of hitting it even bigger as a free agent among next season’s weaker class, the Mets would be more than happy to sign him to a   deal in the $18   $22 million range. But, again: There is no   deal on the table. The Orioles, for their part, know losing Nelson Cruz to the Mariners last season was a terrible blow and basically doomed them in the   AL East.

"AI Could Test For Autism Before It Even Emerges—But It's No Cure-All. Artificial intelligence is ascendant in medicine—from AI eye doctors to chatbot therapists. As medical databases balloon in size and complexity, researchers are teaching computers to sift through and identify patterns, hinting at a future in which machine learning algorithms diagnose disease all on their own. Sometimes, algorithms pick up on early signs of disease that humans wouldn't even know to look for. Last week, researchers at the University of North Carolina and Washington University reported an AI that can identify autistic infants long before they present behavioral symptoms. It's a thrilling opportunity: Early detection gives autism neuroscience a big leg up, as researchers try to understand what goes wrong during development. But now clinicians and researchers have to figure out what they’ll do with that information—is it just a research tool, or will they one day begin diagnosing and treating autism before symptoms start? Especially when it comes to infants, it won't be easy to entrust medical care to a computer-generated guess. In this study, researchers scanned the brains of 59 6 month-olds whose older siblings were already diagnosed with autism. By age two, 11 of those infants had received a diagnosis of autism. By training a machine learning algorithm on their behavior and earlier MRI data, the scientists built a model that predicted 9 of those 11 autism cases, with no false positives. The AI predicted autism around a year before the earliest age—around 14 months—that clinicians diagnose it based on behavior. Most immediately, this model can help researchers understand how the disorder develops and find early interventions for autism. Right now, researchers tracking autism development focus on infant siblings of people with autism; they have 1 in 5 chance of developing autism, compared to around 1 in 100 for the general population. With machine learning, though, researchers could scan infant siblings and focus their research on those at the very highest risk, buying more statistical power. The trouble starts when you try to apply those predictions to treatment, not just research. Once a machine can detect autism earlier than doctors, a whole new set of practical and ethical problems emerge. In order for a predictive tool to be useful for parents and patients, it would have to be accurate and relatively universal. That's certainly not true of this new model, its creators acknowledge. It will selectively predict certain kinds of autism: those that can be diagnosed by age 2 (some kids can't be positively diagnosed until much later), and types of autism that tend to run within families. For a predictive model to be useful for the general population, researchers would need to train their algorithm on a much, much bigger group. They could also improve accuracy by layering on other emerging predictive algorithms—ones based on genes, eye movements, and even baby babbling. It would also need to be accessible to the right people. “Obviously we don't think that every kid in the population can get a scan at 6 months of age,” says Joseph Piven, the senior author on the UNC study—MRI is just too expensive and time-consuming. But genetic tests and family histories could help pediatricians hone in on high-risk infants and offer a scan to them. If you figured out accuracy and distribution, then you'd need to provide effective treatment for those early-stage identifications. “I think we really do have to be thinking about these advanced computational methods for detecting autism—and what we're going to do once we detect,” says Zachary Warren, a clinical psychologist at Vanderbilt University who reviews autism therapies for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. That doesn't mean diagnosis—at least not until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines autism by something other than its behavioral markers. Tom Insel spent 13 years at the National Institutes of Mental Health trying to develop exactly that kind of quantitative framework for psychiatry—based on genetics, behavioral data, and physiological cues—and failed by his own account. So this new information is problematic to use: How can clinicians create an intervention for an infant who might develop autism? All of the researchers interviewed for this story agree that early detection and intervention for autism is better. But current autism therapies for babies and toddlers focus on their specific behavioral deficits—teaching children to communicate needs, to play with toys, and to have positive interactions with caregivers. How do you design a treatment when you don't know what those specific deficits will be? “We know that symptoms for one child are so different from symptoms for another child, so we have to be careful about any blanket treatment that is just going to be applied without knowing what the individual's particular difficulties are going to be,” says Somer Bishop, a clinical psychologist at University of California, San Francisco. Any pre-symptom treatment would have to be effective for the lowest common denominator—mostly likely limiting interventions to behavioral therapies that could help a child regardless of his or her neurodiversity. That's where algorithmic detection could be doubly useful. The UNC group’s next goal is to predict specific autism symptoms, correlating brain scans with future language difficulties, sensory sensitivities, social difficulties, or repetitive behaviors. “Our model is flexibly able to capture this complex pattern in the brain that sets up the foundation for behaviors,” says Robert Emerson, the primary author. And if you can predict symptoms, you can get a lot closer to identifying targeted disease pathways—and targeted preventive treatments, either behavioral or pharmaceutical. But that's not likely to happen soon. ""Oftentimes autism detection science vastly outpaces intervention science,"" says Warren. Which puts caregivers who think their child might be at high risk of autism in a pickle. After this study came out, Piven says many parents of children with autism contacted him requesting scans of younger siblings. “Without this kind of concrete information, what parents hear from their pediatricians is ‘Well, let's just wait and see.’ Parents are rightfully worried,” he says. But with a predictive scan in hand, experimental early intervention on a child without symptoms could be a source of stress. “What's that going to do to parents in terms of their mental health, their ability to attend to other children, their spouse, and family matters and their job?” asks Bishop. “That's where I get worried about people panicking and running to try to seek out very intensive intervention.” To Bishop, a promising middle ground would be to encourage parents to focus on strategies that could help any child, regardless of whether they end up developing autism or not. “There are things that you can do in the context of your everyday routine, at bath time and during diaper changing and feeding, to encourage your child to communicate with you and to play appropriately with you,” she says. As with machine learning, there’s no harm in more training data for babies to learn about the world, regardless of their challenges.",0.0
"One chart that shows how brutal the Russian air campaign in Aleppo really is.  Over the weekend, Bashar  ’s regime and its Russian allies launched a ferocious assault on   territory in the eastern part of Aleppo City. The bombing campaign was stunning even for a place that has long been a central front in Syria’s civil war.    “There are dead people in the streets, and fires are burning without control,” Ammar   the head of the local White Helmets civil defense organization, told the Washington Post’s Liz Sly. “People don’t know what to do or where to go. There is no escape. It is like the end of the world. ” To give you a sense of the breathtaking scale of the violence, I’ve compared US government data on the number of airstrikes in Aleppo with data on the past 72 hours of airstrikes launched by the     campaign. What I found was striking: Russian and Syrian warplanes launched more than twice as many airstrikes on Aleppo alone as the US and its allies launched across the entirety of Syria and Iraq:    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   This data tells us a very clear story. While the United States and its allies are waging a targeted air campaign against ISIS and other extremists, Russia and the Syrian government are launching an   assault on a single city, an assault heedless of the civilian casualties. Washington and its allies have killed innocents but work to avoid it. Russia and Syria  —   which are   densely populated civilian areas with indiscriminate weapons like barrel bombs  —   don’t.       This includes, as my colleague Jennifer Williams explains, a documented pattern of attacks against aid workers and medical professionals. In Aleppo, most hospitals and medical aid centers in rebel areas have been destroyed, while a huge proportion of the city’s doctors  —   including the last pediatrician  —   have been killed.  This number also tells us something else: The recently inked ceasefire in Syria, signed by the US and Russia, is dead letter. While it’s conceivable that the two countries may build on this effort in the future, and move toward some kind of more lasting agreement, that’s cold comfort for the Aleppo residents who are currently living through what Selmo calls “the end of the world. ” ",-1.0
"The Dawn of Twitter and the Age of Awareness. When it came into being in 2006, Twitter seemed perplexing. Publishing teensy, 140-character updates? Whatever was that good for? Twitter seemed like a ghastly mashup of the preening narcissism and nanosecond attention spans that defined the worst trends in digital culture. Tim Ferriss, writer of productivity books, called it “pointless email on steroids.” Who cares what you had for lunch? But critics misunderstood it. What Twitter truly portended wasn’t small, it was huge. As I argued in my first-ever WIRED column more than a decade ago, Twitter represented a massive shift in the way we pay attention to one another. The status update took off and we entered the era we still inhabit: the age of awareness. Before the age of awareness, people conversed via blog posts, threads in discussion forums, email chains. You read someone’s missive, pondered it, wrote back.

"Here’s how solar roofs fit into Elon Musk’s master plan.  Earlier this month, Elon Musk made news again when he announced his intention to offer solar roofs, a product he sensed might need a few words of clarification.    ”It’s a solar roof as opposed to a module on a roof,” he said on an earnings call about the planned merger between his electric car company, Tesla, with his cousin’s solar panel company, SolarCity. ”It’s not a thing on the roof, it is the roof.” This wasn’t technically the first mention of the solar roof  —   it also appeared in Musk’s Master Plan, Part Deux, released in July:  Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful     product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app.     Intriguing indeed. But we don’t have much more information than that.    Since then, the roofs have been called ”out of left field,” and  ”a sweeping expansion of Tesla’s clean energy ambitions,” but they are neither. Solar roofs are not some side goof of Musk’s; they’ve been part of his ambition all along. People just haven’t been taking him seriously. In making sense of this and other Musk moves, it seems to me that a few facts have been, if not missed, at least not emphasized enough.             Electricity is evolving into a more   product It might seem odd to graft a solar panel company onto an electric car company, like joining a dishwasher company with a lawnmower company. Why bother?    But as I noted when he first proposed acquiring SolarCity, Musk is targeting what he sees as an emerging ecosystem, or in terms more familiar to techies, a platform. Solar roofs fit snugly into that platform. The default structure of the electricity system for the last century has been ”hub and spoke”  —   large power plants which pour power into transmission lines, which pour it into distribution grids, which pour it into toasters, air conditioners, and televisions.    It was a   flow, and mostly ”dumb”  —   there wasn’t the will or the technology to closely track or economize power consumption. The system was built to expand, to drive more electricity use, not to wring the most work out of every electron. The consumer’s only relationship to power was to consume it and pay monthly power bills. Today, consumers can also generate electricity  —   they can be   or ”prosumers,” as people who hate the English language call them.             They can share electricity    through microgrids. They can store it in home batteries, or electric car batteries, or as ice, or hot water. They can track its use at a granular level with smart appliances and home energy management systems, which can also shift household supply or demand based on price signals from the grid. They can participate in open power markets using automated software, based on   data about grid supply and demand. Or at least, you know, that’s the idea. Obviously we’re not there yet. The technology is getting close, but a whole skein of incumbent institutions, practices, and regulations lies between here and there. (I’m looking at you, utilities.) Musk wants to design clean energy platforms, not just products Nonetheless, here and there, that   electricity ecosystem (at the grid’s edge) is coming together, spurred on by reforms like those taking place in New York and California. And Musk wants to make that emerging market apparent to consumers, by offering a branded suite of products that encompasses their new relationship with electricity  —   generating it, storing it, and using it to get around.    To begin with ( ) Tesla’s platform will contain three products: rooftop solar panels, electric cars, and home batteries. But that’s just the beginning. Remember, Musk says he wants Tesla to be a ”vertically integrated energy company offering    clean energy products to our customers.” Obviously the company’s   moves will be dictated by finances and where Musk sees the lowest hanging fruit (turns out that’s solar roofs and   trucks). But at least in theory, the Tesla platform could eventually extend to include other means of home electricity generation (solar roofs, solar windows, backyard wind turbines) various means of home energy storage and management (smart appliances and batteries, software to communicate with the grid) and other electric vehicles (small vehicles like scooters, bikes, or Solowheels, utility vehicles, autonomous vehicles).             I am in no way predicting that Tesla will pursue any particular one of those products, just saying that Musk wants to apply Tesla’s engineering acumen and slick branding to a range of products up and down the clean electricity consumer market. Solar roofs are just another piece of that platform. It’s all insanely ambitious, even for someone who’s not also trying to send a manned mission to Mars. Despite the connective tissue of electricity, the businesses in which Musk is getting involved are quite disparate; vertically integrating them won’t be easy. Among other things, it would require a ton of consumer education. And many of the markets required to make the products work as an integrated platform barely exist yet. Indeed, any one piece of the platform could blow up and damage the rest. Tesla is behind schedule on the Tesla 3. SolarCity stock is in the crapper. And as numerous pieces have pointed out (see Grist, MIT Technology Review) solar roofs have been tried before, to no avail. Most notably, less than five years after a   launch, Dow Chemical recently ceased manufacturing its solar roofing shingles.         Over at Greentech Media, Eric Wesoff lists more than a dozen companies that have tried and failed to commercialize solar roofing, windows, and   panels, and another dozen that are still working at it, with no   successes. It is certainly true that Tesla’s solar roof could flounder like the others, though something tells me it will be a lot nicer and get a lot more press. (Had you heard of Dow Chemical’s solar shingles before a few paragraphs ago?) But all this talk about the risks Musk is taking misses something key to understanding his ambitions for Tesla. I think it’s safe to say the possibility of failure means something different to Musk than it does to most entrepreneurs. Above all, Musk is trying to create markets where there were none Musk is not in it for the money. If all he wanted was money, he wouldn’t keep risking enormous sums of it on schemes that nine out of 10 people predict will fail. Instead, as he’s been very forthright in saying, he’s trying to address what he sees as humanity’s most pressing problems. (For insight on Musk, see Ashlee Vance’s biography or this invaluable series on Wait But Why.)             One of those problems is sustainability. This is how he puts it in the Master Plan:     By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.  Sustainability means moving as much energy use as possible to electricity, and cleaning up electricity generation. Tesla is meant to help with the former; SolarCity is meant to help with the latter. Clean energy markets are inevitable. Musk just wants to hasten their arrival. That is how he frames the overarching goal of the Master Plan: ”Here is what we plan to do to make [sustainability] come sooner.” With Tesla, the idea wasn’t only to make money selling cars, it was to revive the moribund EV market  —   mission accomplished. SolarCity was meant to make solar panels a mass market  —   mission accomplished.             No, I’m not giving Elon Musk sole credit for either of those markets, but he did hasten their expansion in a significant and measurable way. Similarly, by going into batteries, solar roofs, and whatever energy gizmo he targets next, he’s trying to kickstart those markets. If Tesla’s solar roof (or the Tesla 3, or SolarCity) fails but demonstrates that there’s a viable market, and other competitors come in to do it better, I don’t know that Musk would be pleased. But the larger and more important part of his aim  —   to unleash consumer capitalism on the problem of sustainability  —   will have succeeded.  The climate debate has devolved into nonsense    ",-1.0
"Better Call Saul’s Rhea Seehorn on why Hollywood shouldn’t doubt comedy stars can do drama.  When she joined the cast of Better Call Saul  —   AMC’s slyly funny, darkly tragic Breaking Bad prequel about the life of unscrupulous lawyer Saul Goodman before his path intersected with Walter White’s  —   Rhea Seehorn was probably best known for her work in sitcoms, particularly NBC’s Whitney, on which she starred from 2011 to 2013.    Seehorn herself wasn’t sure she’d get the part of Kim Wexler, a lawyer on an upward trajectory who has a deep friendship and romantic history with the series’ protagonist. For one thing, Better Call Saul was one of the most heavily hyped new shows in development when it was being cast in 2014. (It debuted in 2015, and its third season premieres on AMC on Monday, April 10.) The female lead in a Breaking Bad spinoff? That was going to go to a big name, right? “I just thought, well, they can get absolutely anyone they want to, so I guess it won’t be me,” she recalls with a laugh on the latest episode of my podcast, I Think You’re Interesting.  She also discusses how hard it was to break out of comedy and get people to even consider her for dramatic parts in Hollywood, where actors are often slotted onto one side of the   line. After 12 years in theater, where moving back and forth across that line is much more common, Seehorn had spent 10 years in TV comedy when she auditioned for Better Call Saul and was frustrated by how she’d been pigeonholed.    Fortunately, she says, the show’s creators, Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, saw things differently:   Vince and Peter don’t put people in a box for doing comedy. When I was doing theater, I did just as much drama as comedy. Not everybody that’s a dramatic actor has comedic timing, so it’s not always a back and forth, but versatility is certainly seen as a virtue, an asset.  Not so when I got out here. I was blown away by the whole, “Well, she’s a sitcom actress, right? We’re not calling her in for this drama. ” I could not get called in for a drama, and if so, it was kind of cursory. At one point, there was feedback. I went in for some   show, and I did the callback, so now I’d done the scene twice, this very serious, wrenching scene. And the feedback was still, “They love her, but the producers really liked her from”  —   I forget what sitcom they had watched  —   “so there’s this worry that she’s going to later on down the road try to bring a comedic element to this. ” Like I’m going to insist on wearing clown shoes during the hospital scene or something? It was the weirdest thing to me!  But Seehorn also attributes landing the role of Kim to how much history she’d built up with the casting directors who worked on Better Call Saul, whom she’d previously auditioned with many times, for other projects. Even though she’d rarely gotten the parts they had called her in for  —   indeed, they often warned her she probably wouldn’t get a part they had called her in for  —   she had built up a rapport with them through her work ethic, one that eventually paid off:     By the time Better Call Saul came up, Sharon Bialy, Sherry Thomas, and Russell Scott, the casting people that I adore, they’ve seen a body of my work larger than has ever seen the light of day, because they’ve been calling me in for 10 years. I’ve done a huge body of work for them for parts I didn’t get. This is what I would tell anybody in this business, especially if they are starting out: There is a reward for bringing your   every time.  I went in for parts for Sharon that they told me flat out, “They have offers to three names. I really don’t think you can get it, but they do want to see some people just in case. ” Figure out what you love about this character, what’s interesting about this character, and give a   performance that you would do in your driveway for the mailman if he’ll sit still. . ..  Love it, despite the result. Love it whether or not you get the job, so that when you leave, what you did was a     performance, one night only, for some of the best casting directors in town, and maybe even the producer or director if they can be there. And they’re gonna cast who they wanna cast, but at least leave the impression that, like, “Holy shit! Wow. That was a very interesting take on that character. ”  I do think that cumulatively it put Sharon in a position to then tell Vince and Peter, whom she knew from Breaking Bad . .. “When you go through 75, 000 [audition] tapes, stop at number four. I think you might be interested in the way this girl works. ” I don’t know what Sharon said exactly, but I have to think that it matters, the work you put in for 10 years prior.

"DOT commissioner finds her missing car. She won’t look be looking “Sideways” at Paul Giamatti any more. Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg announced Saturday that the   actor is blameless in  . After her “ ” ride disappeared from Park Slope for two days Trottenberg fingered Giamatti as having a role in the vanishing  —   because his Showtime hit “Billions” was shooting in her neighborhood last week. Her car, she reasoned, must have been towed to make room for the production crew. ‘I apologize for cracking wise when we were actually at fault.’ “They’re shooting in our neighborhood this show ‘Billions,’” Trottenberg said Thursday at a Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce breakfast. “Some of you might have seen it. It’s got Paul Giamatti in it. Somehow the car has disappeared. ” She continued: “I’m calling Paul Giamatti and making him come give it back. ” But, it turns out, the missing auto was all the fault of her less famous husband, Mark Zuckerman, the president of the Century Foundation, a Big   DC think tank. Zuckerman parked the car on St. Johns Place in front of a nearby driveway  —   and was rightfully towed, the commissioner admitted. “Paul Giamatti is definitely off the hook, and I apologize for cracking wise when we were actually at fault,” Trottenberg said in a statement. Giamatti’s manager said he “was not interested in commenting. ”",1.0
"At 19, this woman weighed 56 pounds. Claire Mercer’s   features several selfies and snaps of delectable dishes. But unlike most   ’ her feed serves as a photographic journal documenting her recovery from anorexia. The Australian native, who has been struggling with the eating disorder since she was 12, is using the power of social media to help others. “I am a recovering anorexic and my mission now is to show young girls that starving for beauty and to be skinny is wrong and I should know,” Mercer said  . As a gymnast, Mercer began weighing herself at just 7 years old. Following her father’s diagnosis with bowel cancer five years later, she blamed herself for his illness. “I deluded myself the reason he had become ill was because we didn’t eat healthily enough as a family,” she said. “Traumatized by this, I made a promise to myself that for the rest of my life, I would only ever eat healthy food. ” Dedicating her life to a restrictive eating regimen and an engulfing exercise routine, Mercer’s weight plummeted to 56 pounds. At 19, she had to be resuscitated after collapsing in the shower. “The doctors said I should have died and told me I was beyond help,” Mercer shared. “I heard them tell my mum and dad I would never recover. ” Embracing her second chance at life, Mercer enlisted her mother to set small eating challenges for her each day as she began her road to recovery. “It was hard. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I stuck to my word and I kept choosing recovery every single day. I ate what I was given, I rested, I didn’t exercise, I listened to my dietician, psychologist, doctor and mom,” she told  . “Every day is a challenge for me to gain weight and to eat, but I am winning. ” Though Mercer admits to still having “bad days,” she is learning to accept herself as she shares her journey with the world. “I had to treat my eating disorder like a cancer. I still find it incredibly difficult to accept my healthy body and my appearance at this weight,” she disclosed. “I don’t want any girl, especially some of the British girls who contact me, to go through what I did. Anorexia is killing our young women, and if I can help one girl then I will have done my job. ”        ",1.0
"The harsh reality of a trans woman’s struggles through life until death.      Tamara would often tell me that she was not going to live past 30. Why would she, she defiantly asked, when society treats her as less than human? I first met Tamara on the streets of downtown Lima, Peru, in the summer of 2013. She was 27 and the first trans woman I photographed. I was immediately drawn to her openness, warmth and friendly, inviting attitude. Tamara had struggled with her identity since elementary school, where she was bullied by her peers, leading her to drop out in the fifth grade. At 16, she began sniffing “terocal,” or glue, to deal with depression. At 18, she began working as a prostitute. “I want to have a job with somebody I know, someone who trusts me. Because otherwise, they discriminate against you, they look at you up and down when you’re looking for work,” she told me.    Men from a truck look at Tamara as she works on the streets.     After resisting sexual relations with a client without a condom, Tamara was injured with a broken glass that he threw at her face.  Tamara’s words sounded like those of other trans women who had searched for employment but were always turned away. For most trans women in Lima, their only option is sex work, which creates hostile, exploitative environments where they’re targets of disease, violence and sexual and substance abuse, with limited opportunities for social security and higher education. My goal in photographing this community was to focus more on life outside of sex work while still highlighting the   consequences of that work. During three years of photographing Tamara, I photographed a few episodes of violence, fights, or drugs and alcohol abuse  —   but the vast majority of what I documented was    life.    Evila helps Tamara zip up her dress before leaving to work on the streets. Though her mom visits when she can, Tamara often spends her days alone.     A detail of Tamara’s bed in the fourth of five rooms she has lived since 2013.  Tamara kept her distance from most people, occasionally forming fleeting friendships with some. But, there was one person with whom she shared an unwavering bond and that was her mother, Evila. When I met her, I was ecstatic not only because she greeted me with open arms, but also because I could see what a pillar of support she was for Tamara. Many trans people in Latin America and around the world are rejected by their parents, so seeing their bond was really unique and special. When they did argue, it was often about Tamara’s work on the street or her use of drugs and alcohol. Once after Tamara had gone missing for hours, she returned home visibly inebriated and high. As Evila waved her finger, arguing about sex work with Tamara, her tears creating long, black streaks down her face, Tamara wailed out helplessly, “What other choice do I have? What do you expect me to do?”    Tamara and Evila joke around.     Tamara says that it’s not easy being trans because of all the aggression and humiliation she and others face. Though she has grown to deal with it, she says that even when walking down the street people will insult her. “I have suffered so much, I don’t understand why we have to suffer so much. ”     Tamara and Evila drink with friends at a nearby bar.     Tamara comforts her mother, Evila, right, after a fight on Tamara’s birthday in 2014.  When I wasn’t on assignment, or photographing other trans women, I was with Tamara and our time together was fairly easygoing. We would cook together, spend holidays together, go out to eat at our favorite roasted chicken place or for ceviche, “ ” as Tamara would jokingly call it. It wasn’t until the death of Tamara’s neighbor, who was also a trans woman, that her life became more complicated. Tamara sent me a string of text messages saying there were things she hadn’t told me, things that if she told me, I would judge her or would stop speaking to her. She finally told me she had HIV, stating that “prefiero que el bicho me coma,” or “I prefer that the bug eat me,” rather than continue living. What followed were a few painful weeks of navigating Peru’s complicated,        public   system. For most trans women it’s incredibly daunting and discriminatory. Many in the   sector blame trans women for the existence of  . But we couldn’t give up. After two months of checking off the boxes of a tediously long list, Tamara got on HIV medication. I felt like a weight had been lifted from her, that there was a lightness in her step, attitude and outlook on life. However, a couple of months later Tamara fell ill and her health deteriorated rapidly. When I saw her emaciated frame, her   face and eyes, I knew immediately she had tuberculosis. One day as we made the slow crawl toward the neighborhood clinic where she would take her daily round of tuberculosis pills, her thin arms clinging to mine, we found ourselves in the middle of a thick sea of purple: It was the procession of Señor de los Milagros, or, “The Lord of Miracles. ” Tamara burst into tears, praying out loud not to die.    After discussing the meaning of HIV with Tamara and much convincing, she finally decides to get on medication, which is provided by the Peruvian government   .     Shortly after getting on HIV medication, Tamara is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Here, a doctor examines an   of her lungs.  Soon after, it seemed her prayers were answered as Tamara improved slowly, filling out her clothes again. Evila and Tamara moved in together, and she stopped drinking and working on the streets. Evila’s income was meager, but they survived and Tamara seemed happy and stable. I moved away from Peru at the end of 2015 but Tamara and I stayed in touch through social media and during a few visits in 2016. When I saw her in November, I asked as I always did, if she was still taking her tuberculosis medication. With a smile, she told me she had finished treatment. The math didn’t add up and it seemed suspicious but she and Evila both assured me as they nodded their heads “yes. ” Last year, Tamara turned 30 on Dec. 23. After sending her a slew of celebratory stickers on Facebook, she responded by saying she was waiting for me to celebrate when I came back to Lima in January. But less than a month later, Evila messaged me and said Tamara had died. She said she had no money for a funeral. In less than 24 hours I was on a plane to Lima. I was worried about how Evila was going to find funds for Tamara’s funeral  —   she made less than $300 a month and had little to no family relatives. I set up a crowdfunding page that reached its goal within a day. The outpouring of support from friends and strangers was incredibly touching and brought Evila to tears. When I arrived, I saw Evila on a busy street in front of the funeral home. We hugged  —   her sobs piercing through the loud Lima traffic  —   as she said, “I lost my life companion. ”    Evila cries next to Tamara’s body.  The autopsy showed that Tamara had died of pneumonia and tuberculosis. Tamara’s voice kept popping into my head, “No voy a vivir más que treinta,” or “I’m not going to live past 30. ” When I think about Tamara and everything she went through, I’m reminded of the thousands of trans women in Latin America just like her who meet the same fate. Thirty percent of transwomen in Lima are infected with HIV. At 80 percent, Latin America leads the world in homicides of transgender people and most don’t live past 35. In my years of seeing the human side of these statistics, I realized that an early death is more common than a long life. Every time I visit, someone else has died.    Tamara waits for clients on the streets.

"How Kim’s story just doesn’t add up. At what point is it acceptable to doubt a Kardashian? As celebrity peers took to Twitter to criticize anyone who made light of the situation, conflicting details continued to emerge about Kim Kardashian’s reported robbery in Paris. First, Kim had been asleep, alone, in a posh,     building favored by celebrities. Then her stylist was in the unit, but not on the same floor. Two armed men broke in. Within hours, it was five. The robbers spoke English until they only spoke French. Her stylist called 911, except in Paris there is no 911  —   you dial 112. But she may have just texted her bodyguard because cell service was bad. The intruders gagged and bound Kim and tossed her in a marble tub while they robbed her of   and escaped on bicycles, which she may or may not have seen from her balcony, where she ran screaming after freeing herself in an ordeal lasting six minutes. Skepticism spread online. “It’s all bogus. I hope she goes to jail,” said one commenter. “Their dumb show is about to be cancelled for low ratings,” said another. “No act or stunt is too vile. ” Given the Kardashians’ history of manipulating people and truth for profit and fame, it’s a karmic reaction. Since “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” premiered in 2007, the family’s hunger for fame has been insatiable; it’s long rumored that Kim Kardashian’s sex tape, leaked that same year, was a publicity stunt orchestrated by momager Kris. In 2012, TMZ reported that Kris Humphries, Kim’s husband of 72 days, told an   that Kris Jenner told Kim to make a sex tape, and upon viewing it, told Kim it wasn’t “pretty enough” and ordered a reshoot. Humphries is just one of many churned and burned through Kardashian contrivances. Last October,  . In addition to Humphries, an NBA player who married Kim in a   E! special  —   only to learn about his impending divorce on the news  —   Khloe Kardashian’s estranged husband, Lamar Odom, has had similar experiences. “He kept saying he was better than the Kardashians and f —  k them,” a friend told the Daily Mail   “He said all they had ever done for him was exploit him for the show. He went through every one of them  —   Kim, Kris, Caitlyn . . . He felt chewed up and spat out. ”  Humphries felt the same way. Producer Russell Jay testified in divorce proceedings that a scene in which Kim expressed doubts about the marriage was filmed after Kim had filed. Humphries, a source told Radar Online, watched in “utter horror” as he was portrayed as a bully and, hilariously, someone interested only in fame. “They set Kris up to look like a jerk,” a source told Radar Online. In August 2015, months before his overdose, Odom complained that Khloe had told him to meet her at a local SoulCycle at 6:45 a. m. then called paparazzi and reacted as if he were stalking her. “I am not, not, not the person they’re making me out to be,” Odom said at the time. While most viewers understand that much of reality TV is, in fact, scripted, the   Kardashians seem mere avatars of their television personas, willing to manipulate anyone, contrive anything, to advance a narrative they can bounce back to the show. In a feature called “Keeping Up with Kontinuity Errors,” the website Jezebel regularly tracks what’s happened in real time versus when it’s happened on air. It requires an almost talmudic knowledge of the show and concurrent tabloid coverage, along with each Kardashian’s   activity and forensic data on their   locations, but it’s safe to say their lives became fictions long, long ago. “Kris’ Fakery Fail: KUWTK Has Lowest Numbers Ever,” Radar Online reported last May. Season 12’s season premiere grabbed a little more than 2 million viewers, and Episode 2 shed more than 500, 000 of those. Kim herself has been eclipsed by younger sisters Kendall and Kylie. Most upsettingly, the entire Western world has trained its klieg lights  Up until 48 hours ago, that is. Of course, Kim’s robbery could very well be true, and, if so, the details are horrifying. But as the biggest “reality” star of the past two decades, Kim Kardashian has become famous for her ability to control her own reality and to define it for us, to control her own narrative. The very notion of some aspect of her story being out of her control seems, ironically, unreal. The whole debate may seem silly, but there are serious ramifications: France has suffered three terrorist attacks in less than two years. Tourism is down. France has long been in a state of emergency. “What happened to [Kim Kardashian] is running nonstop on every channel,” French National Assembly member Nathalie   told Europe1. “Do you realize the kind of   this is for Paris?” Finally, and most curiously of all: The Selfie Queen of the Free World took no photos of her bruises or lacerations, no video of her ransacked room. What kind of reality star is that?",1.0
"‘The Wire’ creator David Simon used the n-word to criticize Sean Hannity. Nope..      On Monday night, the   David Simon wrote a needling Tweet  —   using the    —   about a “Black issues” town hall on Fox News featuring Donald Trump and hosted by Sean Hannity. In the ensuing firestorm, few people questioned his racial bonafides. He’s been telling stories about poor black people in America for more than half his life. His most popular work, “The Wire” TV series, has a mostly black cast and is about urban struggles in mostly black Baltimore. Simon’s works have made him a sort of elder statesmen regarding the intersection of race, politics and socioeconomics in America, pontificating on insidiously racist language around housing reform and the death of Freddie Gray, a black Baltimore man who died in police custody. But does that mean that Simon, a    white man, gets to use the  ? “Hannity my n —  a!” Simon tweeted. “If they couldn’t get a   or Deray to host, then who but you on the pulse of black America. ”   [David Simon of ‘The Wire’ finds drama in public housing.

[The  : an interactive project exploring a single word]   “Obviously it veered off track for some people, but just as obviously I think it’s clear that the intent and purpose wasn’t to offend anyone other than a media group that feels entitled to appoint a white conduit for a birther candidate to discuss issues of import to the black community,” he said. “Would I do it again? No, as the intended purpose was lost amid debate over the word itself. And if that many people are genuinely upset, then their unhappiness is certainly not worth it for a   critique of Sean Hannity and Donald Trump’s racial presumptions,” Simon said. “But no, I don’t think the tweet evidences racism at all, or that the sarcastic tone of an unreliable narrator who claims Sean Hannity as the   choice to address black issues with Donald Trump can be lost on most people. ” He spent most of Monday and Tuesday making those points to Twitter    who were having a hard time getting past the third word in his tweet.

And, as someone who occupies that privileged position, he has   …     a responsibility to be sensitive to socially marginalized groups. ” His advice to Simon: Admit fault and move on. “By far his best option is not to patronize black folks with explanations about the nature of sarcasm and irony,” Armour said. “Thank you, we understand what irony and sarcasm are. Stop ‘whitesplaining’ to black people what irony is and what the   means. The best thing he can do now is just say ‘mea culpa. I’m human.

"This couple has one of NYC’s cheapest rents. Tired of paying   rent? Go with the flow  —   literally  —   and get a houseboat. That’s what one New York couple did in October, when they ditched their $   Nolita apartment for a sloop they’re docking in the Hudson River for $360 month. Victoria Fine says that she and her husband, Jon Vidar, paid “about as much as you’d pay for a used car” for the   sloop they named Scallywag,  . Their    living space contains a kitchen, a bathroom with a shower, two couches, a side table and a   bed. (It also has  .) No one can resist the story of rent that cheap, including Curbed, which   the couple’s bargain home. Of course, life on the water comes with a new set of responsibilities  —   like refilling propane and polishing the deck. “Everything you own is in some state of constant decay,” Fine says. “A couple of weeks ago, I discovered the heels I wore to our wedding had mold growing on them. I’m learning to invest my emotions in experience, not in things. ” While Scallywag’s tight living quarters would test most couples’ patience, Fine says the boat has strengthened their relationship. “The small space requires more grace from each other,” Fine says. “We have to agree on what TV shows to watch, because there’s no room to hide from spoilers. ”",1.0
"These Hallucinatory Landscape Photographs Will Blow Your Mind. As a Seattle-based 3D animation artist, Cody Cobb spends most of his working life behind a computer. Around a decade ago, feeling the need for an escape valve, he started going on solo camping trips around the Pacific Northwest on the weekends. As he ventured farther and farther afield, those weekend trips turned into week-long excursions, which turned into month-long odysseys. ""I discovered that there's this whole other world out there, and it's so accessible,"" Cobb says. Cobb began taking landscape photographs during these trips, at first with a basic 35-mm point-and-shoot camera. Subconsciously, he found himself ""designing"" his photographs the same way he designed his computer animations. ""They were influenced by all the time I spend manipulating geography, arranging shapes and colors. That part of my brain doesn't shut off when I'm outside."" With influences ranging from abstract expressionism to contemporary photographers like his friend Reuben Wu, Cobb's dreamlike work soon attracted critical attention—in 2018 he was named one of PDN's 30 New and Emerging Photographers to Watch. Last winter, Cobb, who has dealt with depression all his adult life, suffered a major depressive episode during a two-month-long solo trip through California and Utah. Unable to sleep at night, he began exploring places like Death Valley in a semi-delirious state, getting purposely lost and shooting what he found with a Fujifilm GFX50, using light from a headlamp and A few small LEDs with colored gels. ""I would just wander and encounter shapes,"" he says. When he got back to Seattle, he created the final photographs by compositing together multiple exposures of the same scene to ensure the right light balance. The resulting images are hallucinatory in their intensity, evoking a fever dream or a psychedelic trip—an effect created in part by the absence of shadows, a trick Cobb learned from 3D modeling. The series, appropriately titled Dark Side, also reflects Cobb's psychological state at the time. ""Allowing myself to be lost and vulnerable when I shot these was pretty important,"" he explains. ""It was so cold, and I was deliberately fasting because I seem to get my best shots when I'm slightly hungry. It heightens all my senses."" Last winter's depressive episode marred what is usually a therapeutic exercise for Cobb. That's why, despite the bad experience, he plans to continue taking multi-month solo trips. ""I kind of need those solitary journeys,"" he says. ""It's not always a comfortable thing to do. It's lonely, it's hard to plan, and it takes a lot of effort—but it's worth it.""",0.0
"The Night Of season 1 premiere: Is Naz too dumb to be believed?.  ”The Beach,” the premiere of HBO’s new crime drama The Night Of, probably left you with a few big questions.    Chief among them, of course, is, ”Did Naz, the young   kid accused of murder, actually do it?” There’s also: ”If Naz didn’t to it, then who did?” It’s easy to see why the police immediately conclude that he’s the perpetrator. After all, both his and the victim’s DNA are all over the crime scene, and he was caught with the murder weapon on him.     Related The Night Of is like a really long Law & Order episode. It’s excellent.    But ”The Beach” also leaves you with a third question: Is Naz (played beautifully, I should add, by Riz Ahmed) simply too dumb to be believed?    It isn’t unfair to ask whether Naz is dumb             I certainly don’t think Naz is particularly idiotic, and I can buy why an obviously smart kid (he tutors athletes on his college’s basketball team) would seemingly take leave of his faculties after discovering the murdered body of a woman he just had sex with. (I’m going to refer to her as ”the woman” until the show reveals her name. Update: As several of you have pointed out to me, the episode does reveal her name at the very end, something I thought was reserved for episode two. It is Andrea. And that’s why I need to rewatch these before writing!)    But essentially the entire story requires Naz to be so panicky in that moment that he ends up in police custody even before they know he’s their chief suspect. And there, the show might strain credulity for certain viewers. Most of Naz’s biggest errors should be wholly believable to just about anyone, I think. The way he simply has to get out of the house once he sees the woman’s dead body makes complete sense, and his slightly   attempts to get away from the police who pull him over for making an illegal left turn are similarly understandable in this context.    But Naz also makes some slightly bigger errors, which can easily feel like major, major stretches. For one thing, he picks up the knife that he and the woman were using to play mumblety peg (the probable murder weapon) and eventually puts it in his pocket. That damns him when the police find it on him. Why wouldn’t he just wipe off the knife and hope he’d gotten his fingerprints off it? (That, of course, would leave his DNA on it, but since he doesn’t have a criminal record he could conceivably escape without trouble.) In addition, there’s the simple fact that he leaves his jacket in the woman’s house when he flees, meaning he has to break in to retrieve it, because the keys to his father’s cab are in the pocket. That arouses the suspicion of neighbors and garners eyewitnesses who saw him leave the crime scene.    I’m not saying a protagonist needs to be smart to be sympathetic. But he needs to at least be consistent. Naz’s idiocy in the moment here might seem to contrast wildly with his earlier intelligence. However, as you might have already surmised, I disagree. Naz’s idiocy is completely believable  —   and not all that idiotic             Everything leading up to Naz’s flight from the woman’s house is carefully constructed to show you just why he might lose all ability to function when cornered. Notice how he gets frustrated and a bit panicked when he ends up lost looking for the house party that first causes him to leave his family’s sleepy home over in Queens. When he can’t find the right street, he grows increasingly flustered, before the woman entering his father’s cab spins the story in a new direction. Similarly, Naz has already received a subtle reminder that most of American society is going to be prejudiced against him, simply because of his national heritage, thanks to those two guys who hurl racial slurs at him as he’s walking the woman to her house. Finally, consider the fact that he’s still drunk and high on a variety of substances (including at least ecstasy) and that he’s not experienced with taking any of these substances. A novice drug user is going to be more heavily impaired than someone who’s gotten high before.    And even if you strip away all of these things, Naz’s reaction to the sudden sight of a murdered body is probably similar to how any one of us might react if what felt like a slightly fantastical night suddenly became a nightmare. I don’t know if I would pick up a knife covered in blood (albeit what seems to be much less blood than would have resulted from the woman’s murder) but I can certainly see myself forgetting my jacket, with car keys in its pocket. Look at just about any crime where a suspect flees the scene in a rush. Everyone makes stupid mistakes, regardless of guilt or innocence, because they realize they’re about to be in very big trouble. Think, for instance, of the different projects about the O. J. Simpson trial that have come out in the past year. Simpson might not have been as bright as Naz, but he certainly got desperate, and in those moments of desperation he made stupid errors that allowed the police to build their case against him. Naz’s stupid moments signal where The Night Of is headed             Above all, Naz’s seeming inability to keep it together is an attempt to signal that The Night Of is less interested in genre trappings than it is in realism. If Naz were a bit savvier, he might act more like the protagonist in a traditional crime drama, trying to cover his tracks. That, then, might force the detectives to work harder to catch him and so on. Instead, The Night Of is interested in telling a story about what happens to someone who has no experience with the criminal justice system, once he’s been tossed right into the middle of it. That’s why so many of its scenes take their time, building up a Naz who can seem almost willfully naive at points, as if he’s never seen an episode of Law & Order, because it’s entirely possible he hasn’t. (Naz doesn’t seem like the type who spends a lot of time vegging out in front of cable rerun marathons.) Indeed, as you watch the scenes leading up to Naz’s arrest, you can start to see how the prosecution might assemble its case against him (those two guys he kicks out of his cab before giving the woman a ride could make it awfully easy to suggest he was preying on women).    And you can start to see where the defense might build in the possibility that somebody else committed the crime, by bringing in the variety of other individuals the couple encounters over the course of the night, to say nothing of how the police could be said to have jumped to conclusions. And then, finally, you have to consider that maybe Naz is guilty. Certainly it would be hard to argue he set out with murder on his mind when he left his house, but the right combination of elements might have led to something horrible and dangerous. If you’re looking at suspects, you pretty much have to start with Naz, right? Naz being stupid might seem like a narrative convenience, an attempt by the series to create drama where it doesn’t need any. But it’s actually a clever hint toward where all of this is going. The Night Of is less a mystery story or a procedural than it is the story of how the American criminal justice system affects everybody it comes into contact with  —   even scared, stupid, desperate kids. Maybe you disagree? Let’s talk about it in comments. Or ask me anything else you like! I’ll be here for 90 minutes, starting at noon Eastern. Ask me absolutely anything you want.

"Chef Michel Richard was happy in the kitchen. And you could taste it..       If you’ve ever had anything resembling a Kit Kat bar in a restaurant, thank Michel Richard. A lot of chefs see something fun in the world and make convincing copies. Richard  —   born in France but long a cheerleader for America  —   not only improved on the original candy bar, he turned it into something diners experienced as fine art and countless competitors tried to emulate.  [Obituary: Chef Michel Richard dies at 68]  To eat the commercial confection reimagined by Richard, a pastry chef trained by the legendary Gaston Lenotre in Paris, was to surrender to the glory of hazelnut chocolate enrobing chocolate mousse on a base of dried, crumbled crepes. No   pony, Richard dazzled patrons over the years with creations that fused beauty and good taste. The tricks in his seemingly bottomless bag included “pasta” coaxed from onion and “caviar” created with Israeli couscous and squid ink. December brought tiny snowmen shaped from balls of meringue and filled with vanilla ice cream, and “Breakfast for Dinner” yielded a fetching tray of everything you expected  —   save for the fact the “toast” was poundcake and the “egg” was a dot of pureed papaya in shimmering almond custard.    One of Michel Richard’s signature dishes at Citronelle was “caviar” created from Israeli couscous and squid ink. (Citronelle)  The common bond: pure deliciousness. Richard died on Saturday in Washington, following complications from a stroke. He was 68. He leaves behind a single restaurant, Central in downtown Washington, and legions of admiring peers and diners grateful to have tasted his signature magic. His flagship restaurant for many years was the   Michel Richard Citronelle in Georgetown. After a genius meal there in 2002 that included escargots sheathed in spiky shredded wheat and a lemon meringue tart circled in a piercing basil sauce, one of my dining companions whispered, “Michel took the place of God there for five minutes. ” Lots of us had such divine moments. Four years later, wine guru Robert Parker told The Washington Post that the chef was “cooking at a level that far exceeds any Michelin   in France. ” Richard started his career as a maker of sweets but always yearned for more. Judging by his food alone, the nonstop tinkerer could have been an architect, a poet or another Thomas Edison. From his kitchen table at Citronelle, he sketched both recipe presentations and Christmas cards (numbering them, as an artist would). His whimsical,     style sprang from science (gleaned as a pastry student) and instinct (honed as a savory chef). Richard devoured the unexpected and incorporated it into his repertoire. His first taste of Kentucky Fried Chicken in this country was an audible revelation. Voila! Crunch became one of his trademarks. For his 55th birthday in 2003, he invited a who’s who collection of chefs from around the world  —   Alain Ducasse, Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller  —   to a charity dinner at Citronelle. The VIPs were expected to cook and serve the feast. But the highlight of the evening, according to Mark Furstenberg, the Washington baker and a pal of Richard’s, was when the culinary luminaries gathered around their host to watch him demonstrate his sleights of hand.    Revelers swirl around chef Michel Richard at his 2003 birthday party at Citronelle. (Rebecca D’  The Washington Post)  “This could never happen anyplace other than Washington,” Eric Ripert, chef of New York’s acclaimed Le Bernardin, said at the time. On Saturday, he added, “Michel was a magnet. ” He was also a flirt and a jokester, clever but never gimmicky. Who else but Richard could mince potatoes so fine you’d swear you were eating risotto? After tasting the dish in 1993, Post food critic Phyllis C. Richman wrote, “He is the best friend a potato ever had. ” One of the dirty little secrets of the restaurant world? A lot of chefs don’t really like to cook, preferring the managerial and perhaps marketing aspects of  . Not Richard. He reveled in his   kitchen at Citronelle, often showing up in the morning when the competition had yet to get out of bed, to work on an idea he might have come up with while watching   infomercials. He also shopped in unexpected places (such as Home Depot, for the miniature power rotary saw he used to cut egg tops with the precision of a wood carver). “That kind of joy is rare,” said former Gourmet editor Ruth Reichl, who as food editor of the Los Angeles Times in the 1980s once invited Richard to Thanksgiving and watched in amazement as he carved a whole turkey in what she remembers as 10 seconds. “I never saw him happier than he was at the stove. ” Indeed, the second of three cookbooks with his name on it is “Happy in the Kitchen” (2006). Of cooking, Richard once said, “It’s a religion. You have to love it. ” As stunning as his dishes could be, in the end, the maestro understood its evanescent nature. Furstenberg remembers Richard telling him, “It’s supposed to be food. ”    Michel Richard with baker and friend Mark Furstenberg in 2002. (Michael   Washington Post)  Despite the many accolades his work received, including the outstanding chef award from the prestigious James Beard Foundation in 2007, Richard never achieved the global renown of, say, Wolfgang Puck, the Austrian native famous for Spago in Los Angeles and gourmet pizzas everywhere. If there was a skill Richard lacked, it was a gift for business. His onetime establishments in Los Angeles, Atlantic City, Tokyo, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and elsewhere do not survive him. An attempt to return two years ago to Manhattan, where he opened a pastry shop for Le Notre in 1974, was met with a   review from the New York Times for the Bistro at Villard Michel Richard. In a 2006 profile of his   Cedric Maupillier, a veteran of both Citronelle and Central, told The Post: “Failure is not a problem. It’s not trying that’s the problem. That’s what Michel tells us every day. ” Richard tried. Boy, did he try! And more often than not, he seemed to get a kick out of doing so. ",-0.5
"The summer solstice is upon us: 7 things to know about the longest day of the year.  The summer solstice is upon us: June 20th and the 21st will be the longest days of 2017 for anyone living north of the equator. If pagan rituals are your thing, this is probably a big moment for you. If not, the solstice is still pretty neat.    Technically speaking, the summer solstice occurs when the sun is directly overhead the Tropic of Cancer, or 23. 5° north latitude. In 2017, this will occur at exactly 12:24 am (Eastern) on the 21st. (But we can celebrate on either day.)  Below is a short scientific guide to the longest day of the year (though not, as we’ll see, the longest day in Earth’s history  —   that happened back in 1912). 1) Why do we have a summer solstice, anyway? Okay, most people know this one. Earth orbits around the sun on a tilted axis (probably because our planet collided with some other massive object billions of years ago, back when it was still being formed).    So between March and September, Earth’s Northern Hemisphere gets more exposure to direct sunlight over the course of a day. The rest of the year, the Southern Hemisphere gets more. It’s the reason for the seasons:            In the Northern Hemisphere, ”peak” sunlight usually occurs on June 20, 21, or 22 of any given year. That’s the summer solstice. By contrast, the Southern Hemisphere reaches peak sunlight on December 21, 22, or 23 and the north hits peak darkness  —   that’s our winter solstice.            2) How many hours of sunlight will I get on Tuesday? That depends on where you live. The further north you are, the more sunlight you’ll see during the solstice.   climatologist Brian Brettschneider created this terrific guide:         On the off chance you live near the Arctic Circle, the sun never really sets during the solstice.         (By contrast, during the winter solstice, Fairbanks only gets about three hours of sunlight.) Here’s another cool way to visualize the extreme of the summer solstice. In 2013, a resident of Alberta, Canada  —   several hundred miles south of Fairbanks, but still in a high latitude  —   took this pinhole camera photograph of the sun’s path throughout the year, and shared it with the astronomy website EarthSky. You can see the dramatic change in the arc of the sun from December to June. (You can easily make a similar image at home. All you need is a can, photo paper, some tape, and a pin. Instructions here.)      (function( d, s, id)  (document, ’script’ ’ ’)); This is a 6 month pinhole photo taken from solstice to solstice, in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. We are one of the sunniest cities in Canada, and this shows it nicely. Posted by Ian Hennes on Saturday, December 21, 2013   Note that the solstice also gives us the longest twilight of the year, usually about 1 to 1. 5 extra hours after sunset. (Brettschneider has more charts on that; his entire post is worth your time.) Side note: This year, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan coincides with the solstice. (Ramadan’s dates vary each year, but in 2017 it runs from May 26 to June 24.) Which makes for a grueling challenge in some places: Muslims are supposed to fast until sunset during Ramadan, but for those living in Norway, Sweden, or Iceland, daylight can last up to 20 hours. ”In these cases,” Vox’s Jennifer Williams explains, ”Muslim religious authorities have decreed that Muslims can either fast along with the closest Muslim country or fast along with Mecca, Saudi Arabia.” 3) Is the solstice the latest sunset of the year? Not necessarily. Just because June 20 is the longest day of the year for the Northern Hemisphere doesn’t mean every location has its earliest sunrise or latest sunset on that day. If you live in Washington, DC, you missed the earliest sunrise  —   it happened back on June 13. But you can still catch the latest sunset on June 27. If you like sleeping in, that’s arguably the most exciting day of the summer. 4) What does all this have to do with Stonehenge? No one really knows why Stonehenge was built some 5, 000 years ago (at least I don’t, sorry). But one possibility is that it was used to mark solstices and equinoxes. That’s because during the summer solstice, the sun rises just over the structure’s Heel Stone and hits the Altar Stone dead center. Here’s a graphic from NASA imagining what a summer solstice sunrise might’ve looked like back when Stonehenge was fully intact:            Nowadays, humans still gather to pay homage the summer solstice at Stonehenge  —   they just use modern technology, like so:            The Wikipedia entry on Stonehenge is absurdly detailed, so read up on that if you want more.    5) Is this the longest day in Earth’s entire history? Probably not, although it’s close. And the reason why is quite interesting. Joseph Stromberg did a fantastic deep dive into this topic for Vox a few years back, but here’s the   version. Ever since the Earth has had liquid oceans and a moon, its rotation has been gradually slowing over time due to tidal friction. That means  —   over very, very long periods of time  —   the days have been getting steadily longer. About 4. 5 billion years ago, it took the Earth just six hours to complete one rotation. About 350 million years ago, it took 23 hours. Today, of course, it takes about 24 hours. And the days will gradually get longer still. Given that, you’d think 2017 would be the longest day in all of history. But while it’s certainly up there, it doesn’t quite take top honors. That’s because tidal friction isn’t the only thing affecting Earth’s rotation  —   there are a few countervailing factors. The melting of glacial ice, which has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 12, 000 years ago (and is now ramping up because of global warming) is actually speeding up Earth’s rotation very slightly, shortening the days by a few fractions of a millisecond. Likewise, geologic activity in the planet’s core, earthquakes, ocean currents, and seasonal wind changes can also speed up or slow down Earth’s rotation.    When you put all these factors together, scientists have estimated that the longest day in Earth’s history (so far) likely occurred back in 1912. That year’s summer solstice was the longest period of daylight the Northern Hemisphere has ever seen (and, conversely, the 1912 winter solstice was the longest night we’ve ever seen). Eventually, the effects of tidal friction should overcome all those other factors, and Earth’s days will get longer and longer as its rotation keeps slowing (forcing timekeepers to add leap seconds to the calendar periodically). Which means that in the future, there will be plenty of summer solstices that set new records as the ”longest day in Earth’s history.” 6) Isn’t there going to be a solar eclipse?          No, not on the solstice.  But there will be a rare solar eclipse across the entire continental US a bit later in the summer, on August 21.  On that day, the Earth, moon, and sun will be in perfect alignment to cast a    shadow that will trace itself across the country like a dark laser pointer on a whiteboard.  In the bull’s eye center of the moon’s shadow known as the totality, the sky will go dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day, stars will appear, and birds will become confused and start chirping their nighttime songs. And it’s all because of a cosmic coincidence: From the Earth, both the moon and sun appear to be roughly the same size.   7) I clicked this article accidentally and really just want a cool picture of the sun            The image above was taken by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, a spacecraft launched in 2010 to better understand the sun. Caption: ”A   multiwavelength extreme ultraviolet image of the sun taken March 30, 2010. False colors trace different gas temperatures. Reds are relatively cool (about 60, 000 Kelvin, or 107, 540 F); blues and greens are hotter (greater than 1 million Kelvin, or 1, 799, 540 F).”    In 2018, NASA will launch the Parker Probe Plus, a spacecraft that will come within 4 million miles of the surface of the sun (much closer than any spacecraft has been before). The goal is to study the sun’s atmosphere, weather, and magnetism, and figure out the mystery of why the sun’s corona (i. e. its atmosphere) is much hotter than its surface. Still, even several million miles away, the probe will have to withstand temperatures of 2, 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  It’s essential to understand the sun: It’s nothing to mess with. Brad  Plumer wrote about what happens when the sun erupts and sends space weather our way to wreak havoc on Earth. Happy solstice! ",-1.0

In an interview in the Kansas offices of his company, Koch Industries, the billionaire businessman and political donor at first said he could not see a chance he would support Clinton this fall despite his concerns about Trump. He immediately amended his remark. “There is a chance,” he could support Clinton, Koch said, “but it’s highly remote. ” Last month, Koch told ABC News in an interview that it was possible Clinton could be a better president than the GOP nominee, a statement that raised eyebrows on the left and right. On Tuesday, he clarified what he meant. “What I’m trying to say is that I’m not for Republicans or Democrats. I couldn’t care less about what the party label  —   in fact, I agree with George Washington’s concern about parties. They become an end in themselves rather than helping people improve their lives. So what I was trying to say is, if Hillary had policies that would more likely make people’s lives better than Republicans, I’d be for Hillary. I’m for whoever will do that.

"Don’t think you have a ‘yoga body’? This Instagram star has a message for you..  Yoga is not all about flawless handstands, sweaty selfies and perfect crow poses at sunset, despite what your Instagram feed may suggest. The ugly truth is that it takes hard work, time and patience, not to mention strength and flexibility. Jessamyn Stanley, a yoga fan turned social media fitness star, is breathing proof of it. Stanley’s first book, a      titled “Every Body Yoga: Let Go of Fear, Get on the Mat, Love Your Body,” breaks down 50 basic poses to encourage beginners of all shapes and sizes  —   not just the willowy,   swans that flood your   feeds  —   to get on the mat and start practicing. The    Durham, N. C. native, who is popular with her followers for shattering yoga stereotypes and spreading a message of   and   swung through Washington on her national book tour to discuss her practice, her outlook and her latest work. She also offered some practical advice for both beginners and seasoned practitioners.   You might feel awkward during your first class. That’s normal. Stanley distinctly remembers her experience with Bikram yoga when she was 16 because it was hotter than, as she calls it, “Satan’s sauna” and it was so difficult she had to leave halfway through the class. It would be another handful of years before she would return to the mat.   Jessamyn Stanley, a    Durham, N. C. native, began practicing yoga after leaving grad school in 2011. (Christine Hewitt )  Her advice to  ? “It’s important to remember that you don’t have to keep in line with everyone else, that it doesn’t matter if you’re practicing a pose in a way that looks completely different than the person next to you. No one  —   big, small, short, tall  —   is expected to be the best or even at [a] beginner level on their first day,” she said in an interview. “Try not to pay attention to how other people perceive you and value how you feel above all else. If you can say, ‘I’m just going to appreciate this experience for what it is,’ you’ve already succeeded. ” Embrace your self  —   and your selfie. Stanley started posting cellphone pictures back in 2013 as way to easily track her alignment, log her progress and engage with the online yoga community. Now she has more than 290, 000 followers on Instagram.  “When I started taking photos, I would do it because I felt really strong and powerful in the moment and in the posture. Then, I would look back at the photo and think, ‘Oh my god, my belly is so big! My arms are so jiggly!’ ” Stanley recalled. Over time, however, she began to realize she was her own worst critic. “I began asking myself, ‘You felt so powerful before, what changed? Nothing,’ ” she said. “Addressing that conflict and allowing myself that freedom was monumental. ” Learning to be comfortable, or even just accepting, of your body is transformational. “If you say, ‘My body isn’t owned by anybody else. I need to love my body for what it is,’ it can make all the difference. ” Words only have negative power if you let them.  “The word ‘fat’ has come to be associated in modern society with stupid, ugly and unworthy  —   like it’s the ultimate insult  —   when really it’s just another word for large,” Stanley said. She is an advocate of reclaiming the word and its meaning. “If you can take away the weapon they are trying to use against you, you can reclaim your power, your privilege and step into your strength. ”   Stanley’s first book, “Every Body Yoga,” was recently released by Workman Publishing. (Workman Publishing)  Ask “How do I feel?” rather than “How do I look?” “I used to obsess over what other people thought of me until I started digging deeper and discovering about how I truly felt,” Stanley explained. “And that started bleeding into other parts of life, like getting dressed in the morning. You start asking yourself, ‘How does this make me feel?’ rather than, ‘Is this something other people think I should be wearing?’ ”  Be wary of the Instagram effect. “I’ve noticed there are a lot of fake people in the yoga world,” Stanley said. She’s over the Photoshopped pictures of asanas on the beach captioned with Gandhi quotes. “It’s all very, ‘Look at me, look how perfect I am’ and I am not really in to all of that,” Stanley said, adding, “All I am trying to do is live my yoga. ” Feeling bored or stifled by your practice? Switch it up. “Try a new teacher or studio, or experiment with a different style of yoga. In a big city like Washington, you can find a different studio literally around the corner,” Stanley says. Also, “remember to praise yourself for the little things, like the fact that you showed up to class and got on your mat. ” Motivational music is key. “I love listening to   while I practice, because I like to have a hard beat that I can lean into, especially when the practice is very physically demanding,” Stanley says. “Kendrick Lamar’s “Good Kid, M. A. A.D City” is the album I would pair with my book because he also tells a story about what’s it like to be living your life, . . . making bad decisions” and eventually getting to a place of  .

Even her first cellphone photos uploaded to her   Instagram account were taken with a   tripod of large chapter books. With research, patience and persistence, her yoga practice blossomed.  “You don’t have to buy anything or change your life,” Stanley says. “You can start practicing today, in this moment, one pose at a time. ”  Jessamyn will be at Willow Street Yoga in Silver Spring, Md. on June 2.

"Yankees bats hide all their warts in big comeback. It didn’t quite have the drama of a dive into the stands against the Red Sox or a flip play in the postseason, but the Yankees kicked off Derek Jeter Night in style on Sunday with a comeback   win over the Astros in the first game of a doubleheader in The Bronx. The win allowed the Yankees to avoid a   fourth straight loss and was sparked by a     triple by the struggling Chase Headley in the bottom of the seventh. “It’s been a little bit of a struggle lately,’’ said Headley, who came to the plate stuck in a    slump. “I picked a good time to break through. ”      hits by Brett Gardner and Jacoby Ellsbury earlier in the seventh put runners on second and third before Matt Holliday’s infield hit to short got the Yankees to within a run. Starlin Castro, whose error in the top of the inning helped give the Astros a   lead, atoned for his miscue with an RBI double to right to tie the game,  . After an intentional walk to Aaron Judge that loaded the bases with one out, Didi Gregorius struck out, bringing up Headley, who has cooled off considerably since his fast start to the year. Headley responded by belting a   triple to   to give the Yankees a   lead. “You tell yourself to relax,” Headley said. “You take a deep breath. When you haven’t gotten a hit in a while, it feels like it’s been five years since you’ve had one. ” The gapper bailed out Adam Warren, who had been unable to protect a   lead in the top of the inning. After Chad Green tossed 3   scoreless innings in relief of an awful Luis Severino, Warren quickly put a pair of runners on and then gave up an RBI single to Evan Gattis. Marwin Gonzalez followed with a slow grounder to second. Castro made an   flip to second to try to get the force, but his attempt was far off target and Gregorius had no chance at the ball. The miscue allowed Jose Altuve to score and Gattis to get to   which proved damaging when he scored on a long fly ball to right by Yuli Gurriel to make it  . Castro atoned for the error in the seventh with a   double before Headley continued the rally. It started with a   single by Gardner and a double by Ellsbury. Holliday’s infield hit made it   before Castro knotted the game at  . Judge, who homered in the fourth, was walked intentionally and Gregorius struck out, bringing up Headley, who delivered with two outs. The comeback overshadowed Severino’s worst outing of the season. The   had lasted at least five innings in each of his first six starts of the season. Not on Sunday. The Yankees took a   lead in the bottom of the first, but Houston went ahead in the third, as Severino’s command issues continued. After walking three batters in the first two innings, Severino opened the third by hitting George Springer. Later in the inning, he surrendered four straight singles to end his afternoon, but Green came in and got an   double play. “He did a great job,” Joe Girardi said of Green, called up Sunday from      to take the injured Aroldis Chapman’s spot on the roster. “And we’re gonna score runs. This was another big win for us. ”",1.0
"Yellowstone has a 50 square mile ""Zone of Death"" where you can get away with murder.  Let’s imagine Daniel and Henry are vacationing in Yellowstone National Park, and set up camp in the 50 square miles of the park that are in Idaho (unlike most of the park, which is in Wyoming). They get into a fight and Daniel winds up killing Henry. But rather than bury the body and try to cover up the crime, Daniel freely admits to it and surrenders himself to the authorities.    At his trial, he invokes his right, under the Sixth Amendment, to a jury composed of people from the state where the murder was committed (Idaho) and from the federal district where it was committed. But here’s the thing  —   the District of Wyoming has purview over all of Yellowstone, even the parts in Montana or Idaho. So Daniel has the right to a jury composed entirely of people living in both Idaho and the District of Wyoming  —   that is, people living in the Idaho part of Yellowstone. No one lives in the Idaho part of Yellowstone. A jury cannot be formed, and Daniel walks free. That scenario is fiction, but all the legal maneuvers Daniel employs are completely legitimate, and someone in a similar situation could quite possibly get off scot free. That got a lot of attention when it was first pointed out by Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt in his 2005 Georgetown Law Journal article, ”The Perfect Crime.” After all, it implied that there was a 50 square mile ”Zone of Death” of the United States where you can commit crimes with impunity, like in The Purge or something. The scenario even got featured in a   mystery novel, Free Fire by CJ Box, who consulted Kalt when writing the book. What’s more, the Zone of Death had a simple fix: Congress could simply pass a law placing Idaho’s portions of Yellowstone inside the District of Idaho. Montana’s less of a problem, since a handful of people actually do live in its part of Yellowstone and could be summoned as a jury, but Congress might as well give Montana’s portion of Yellowstone to the District of Montana too.    So Kalt set about trying to get Congress to do just that. Nine years later, the Idaho loophole persists. And it wasn’t because Congress just didn’t hear about it; several members became aware of the loophole. Here’s the story of how Congress managed to leave a 50 square mile Zone of Death standing despite it being known for nearly a decade.    Reaching out    CJ Box’s Free Fire, whose central murder is inspired by Kalt’s article. Image via Amazon. com  According to Kalt’s 2008   article ”Tabloid Constitutionalism: How a Bill Doesn’t Become Law,” he alerted the Department of Justice, the US Attorney for Wyoming, and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the loophole a year before publishing the piece, in hopes that it could be closed before publication, on the off chance the article might drive people to try to commit crimes in Yellowstone. He got a reply from the US Attorney noting it wasn’t in his power to change the law, and another from an intern at the House Judiciary Committee, but nothing came of it. The article’s release and subsequent press blitz didn’t accomplish anything either.   Larry Craig ( ) promised to look into the issue but did not do anything beyond that. Rep. Mike Simpson ( ) who’s still in office, stated through a spokesperson that he didn’t think the Zone of Death was a problem, and argued we could ”count on ’checks and balances’ to remedy the issue, should a murder be committed,” a response which betrays a marked lack of understand of what the term ”checks and balances” actually refers to.    In spring 2007, Box’s novel was released. This is when Kalt finally managed to get some traction. Senator Mike Enzi ( ) a fan of Box’s work, asked the Department of Justice to look into the issue. They did, and concluded that no fix was needed. The legal argument offered was that trying someone in the wrong state or district amounts to a ”harmless error”; both Kalt and Enzi thought this was clearly wrong, as the ”error” in question is a clear violation of one’s Sixth Amendment right to a trial in the state and district where the crime allegedly occurred, and so could hardly be judged ”harmless.” But another point DOJ made was more consequential. ”Splitting Yellowstone into the district courts for Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana would also split it between the Ninth and Tenth Circuits,” Kalt writes. ”Senator Enzi and others were wary of this because it would create a new and unwelcome burden if environmentalists could use this foothold to challenge the Park Service’s management decisions in the liberal and quirky Ninth Circuit.” Whatever you think about the idea that keeping environmental cases out of a liberal court is worth leaving the Zone of Death in place, it just isn’t true that fixing the loophole would necessarily allow   for appeals about Yellowstone. As Kalt writes, ”There is nothing to preclude Congress from designating the Tenth Circuit as the proper venue for all administrative appeals concerning Yellowstone National Park.” officials are too busy working on more important issues to eliminate the Zone of Death    After the   article came out, Senator Mike Lee ( ) was elected, which, for personal reasons, made Kalt optimistic about a fix again. ”I knew Mike when we were associates together at the same law firm in DC,” Kalt says. ”Not only did he get elected to the Senate on a platform of taking the Constitution seriously, he got assigned to the very subcommittee that would be in charge of fixing this. But he has been otherwise occupied.” That’s the basic story so far: officials are too busy working on more important issues to eliminate the Zone of Death. ”They have lots of more important things to worry about,” Kalt says. ”Of course, they aren’t fixing those things either, but I need to be realistic here.” An actual case After Box’s novel was released, as Kalt was working with Enzi on a potential fix, the loophole actually became a live issue for the first time. Michael Belderrain, who had illegally shot an elk in Montana in December 2005, cited Kalt’s article in his own defense in July 2007. Belderrain was standing in Yellowstone when he fired the shot, and dragged the elk’s head to a truck parked in Yellowstone, so he was indicted in the US District Court for the District of Wyoming. He objected that he had a right to be tried by jurors from the Montana portion of the park. That’s actually somewhat possible, as the Montana part of Yellowstone is inhabited, but there are few enough residents that a trial would be difficult. Rather than try to call such a jury or present an argument for why the Sixth Amendment did not entitle Belderrain to such a trial, the court dismissed the argument out of hand, precisely because it would imply that Yellowstone contains a Zone of Death. There were three problems with this. First, as Kalt notes, Congress implies there’s a Zone of Death, not the attorney making the point in court. Second, the ruling was about Montana, in which there wouldn’t be a Zone of Death even if the court accepted Belderrain’s reasoning due to people living in the Montana portion of Yellowstone. Third, the court flagrantly ignored Article III of the Constitution’s separate right to a trial in the state of the crime by not moving the trial to Montana. So surely Belderrain would appeal, right, and get the courts to take a stand on the issue once and for all? Nope. He took a plea deal which included a provision barring him from appealing this precise issue to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He could appeal other issues, but not this one. So the only precedent we have on the Zone of Death is a district court ruling which appears badly flawed. the loophole looms, waiting for a murderer to exploit it    ”That bothers me more than the inaction from Congress, because they had a golden opportunity to let this be resolved,” Kalt says. ”Maybe the Tenth Circuit would have said I was wrong. That would have ended things. Maybe they would have said I was right. That would have spurred Congress to fix this, something that would have only taken them a few simple lines of legislation to do. Either way, it would have been fixed in a relatively   case. Instead, the loophole looms, waiting for a murderer to exploit it. I feel like I’ve done what I can to prevent this; the blood will be on the government’s hands.” Can we fix it now? I reached out to Idaho’s current Congressional delegation to see how they felt about there being a Zone of Death in their state, and what they’d be willing to do to fix it. Lindsay Nothern, communications director for Senator Michael Crapo ( ) says the delegation has expressed an interest in resolving the issue but hasn’t received cooperation from the relevant executive branch agencies. ”Congressionals have asked legal and agency personnel for advice on legislative language but I am told none has been forthcoming and the issue stands unresolved,” Nothern writes in an email. For his part, Kalt says the following draft language should work, leaving aside complications about the Ninth Circuit:  SEC. 1 Section 131 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ”and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in Montana and Idaho constitute” and inserting in lieu thereof ”constitutes”. SEC. 2 Section 92 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ” exclusive of Yellowstone National Park,”. SEC. 3 Section 106 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by striking out ” exclusive of Yellowstone National Park,”.  Suzanne Wrasse, press secretary for Senator Jim Risch ( ) said the Senator was not previously aware of the loophole, but was not overly concerned as ”that area is incredibly small and has an extremely low crime rate” and the existence of the Zone ”shouldn’t stop state prosecution  —   they have dual jurisdiction in that area.” Kalt disputes the latter point. ”Senator Risch is badly mistaken,” he says. ”The state cannot prosecute a crime committed entirely in the park.” When the states containing Yellowstone were admitted to the Union, they ceded jurisdiction over the park. To quote the US code: ”The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined, or as they may be hereafter defined or extended, shall be under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.” As of this post’s publication, neither Rep. Simpson nor Rep. Raúl Labrador ( ) had replied with a comment. ",-1.0
"Trump’s treasury pick gives hedgies 12 billion reasons to smile. Hedgies invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac unwrapped an early $12 billion Christmas present from   Donald Trump on Wednesday. That’s how much value was added to the mortgage giants’ shares after   said one of his priorities was to “get Fannie and Freddie out of government ownership. ” “It makes no sense that these are owned by the government and have been controlled by the government for as long as they have,” the    former Goldman Sachs partner told Fox Business Network. Investors took Mnuchin’s comments to mean the Treasury Department would stop collecting the profits of the two companies  —   as it has since taxpayers came through with a $187. 5 billion bailout in 2008. Hedge fund moguls have been pressing that point for years. On Wednesday, shares of the two companies soared 45 percent. And the timing couldn’t have been better  —   coming on the last day of the month when hedge funds, many of which have been struggling, close out their books. For the month, each company is up nearly 230 percent. In 2012  —   as Fannie and Freddie were returning to profitability  —   the bailout terms were modified, redirecting profits to the Treasury Department, not to shareholders. Hedge funds that invested in the two  —   Pershing Square, Paulson & Co. and     Perry Capital  —   have been fighting the government’s decision through a mix of lawsuits and lobbying efforts. Perry Capital has claimed the profit sweep is “unconstitutional. ” Representatives from Perry Capital did not respond to requests for comment. Pershing’s Bill Ackman has long argued that Fannie and Freddie allowed for the creation of the   mortgage  —   and in 2015 called the   mortgage a “uniquely American financial product. ” “Fannie and Freddie should be limited to the core business they were set up to do, which is to guarantee first mortgages on   housing for creditworthy borrowers, and that’s a safe business,” Ackman said in early November. “It’s a   business. ” “I couldn’t imagine a better person to negotiate with than someone who knows something about real estate,” Ackman said of Trump. Pershing Square declined to comment further. Still, despite recent investor exuberance, ending the government conservatorship will not be easy even though people “assume the seas are going to part” for Trump, Christopher Whalen, senior managing director of KBRA, told The Post. “You can’t end the support of the federal government  —   you would still have to have some kind of backstop. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have investors. That’s the bottom line,” Whalen said.",1.0
"7 details in the Republican health care bill that harm the poor.  The Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s signature health reform, had one big goal: to make health insurance more affordable and accessible to those who had trouble getting coverage.     In essence, that meant finding ways to get America’s poor  —   the millions who couldn’t pay for private health insurance or were ineligible for Medicaid  —   health coverage.  The new GOP health reform plan, the American Health Care Act, is filled with provisions  —   some subtle, some not  —   that’ll undo that work.  1) The penalty for not buying insurance that replaces the individual mandate is most punishing for   Americans  It has long been a truism of American health care that a small group of patients cost the most money. And it is this minority, with their hefty medical bills, that are the most challenging group for any insurer to cover.    The Affordable Care Act’s answer to this problem was the individual mandate: Require everybody to buy insurance through the individual mandate, and put the young, old, sick, and healthy into the same pool, evening out the risk and offsetting some of the costs of covering that minority for insurers. Under Obamacare, if you didn’t buy health insurance, you faced a fine, which scaled up based on income.     The Republican plan does away with the individual mandate, and replaces it with a continuous coverage penalty: You can choose to be uninsured if you want, but when you try to buy insurance again, you face a 30 percent higher premium for a year.   A new analysis by the health research firm Avalere finds this new method will be more punishing for the poor than the individual mandate was, and will actually give the wealthy a break.     Just check out this chart from its report. It outlines the case of a    seeking new health insurance on the individual market, and compares the fines he’d face under the current law (Obamacare) and under the AHCA:             The red text indicates a worse deal under the Republican plan, and the green a better deal. You’ll notice that people in the higher income brackets are generally getting better deals than the   earners.  That means someone who brings home $59, 400 a year (500 percent of the federal poverty level) and hasn’t had insurance for a year would effectively pay a smaller penalty under the AHCA than under Obamacare, Vox’s German Lopez writes, and someone who’s making $11, 880 a year (100 percent of the federal poverty level) would pay more. Here’s Lopez again:    In general, the AHCA penalty is just harder for the poor. Since it doesn’t scale with income, everyone, from Bill Gates to someone making nothing a year, will have to pay the same amount: a flat 30 percent extra on a premium. But that penalty . .. is a much bigger share of a person’s income if he or she makes $10, 000 a year instead of $100, 000, $1 million, or $1 billion. 2) The tax credit changes to help people buy insurance are less helpful for the poor, and more helpful for the upper   In order to help more people purchase insurance, Obamacare gave people   tax credits. Poorer people got more help buying their coverage than richer people. These credits were important for those who didn’t get health insurance through their work, didn’t qualify for Medicaid, and needed a little help to buy their insurance on the individual marketplace.  The new Republican plan gets rid of   subsidies and replaces them with a new system of tax credits based on age.  In a sentence: The new system will be less generous than the Obamacare variation for the poor and elderly, and more helpful for the upper  . Just check out this chart, via Cynthia Cox at the Kaiser Family Foundation:            The group estimates that a    making $20, 000 (or 160 percent of the poverty line) would get $4, 143 in subsidies under the ACA but only $3, 000 under the GOP plan. A      making $75, 000 annually, would get no tax subsidy under the ACA but $3, 000 under the Republican plan.  Older folks would also fare more poorly under the AHCA. A    earning $20, 000 a year (again, 160 percent of the poverty line) would get $9, 874 under Obamacare and $4, 000  —   or less than half that  —   under the new Republican plan.    That’s why this Kaiser Family Foundation analysis noted, “People who are lower income, older, or live in high premium areas would be particularly disadvantaged under the American Health Care Act. ”   Sign up for VoxCare, edited by Sarah Kliff  Vox’s daily email explaining the biggest news in health care.

To understand what that means, let’s step back a bit. Prior to the passage of the law, in most states, only children and parents, pregnant women, or the disabled were eligible for Medicaid. So all other poor Americans  —   the working poor who didn’t have kids or who weren’t disabled  —   often couldn’t afford private health insurance but also weren’t eligible for Medicaid. Obamacare came along in 2010 and changed that: Suddenly anyone whose family income fell below 138 percent of the federal poverty level (about $15, 000 for an individual) was eligible for government health insurance. The federal government also offered states funding to pay for all the new enrollees in the program. A majority of the states (32, including Washington, DC) took the money, expanding Medicaid. And it’s no surprise. The feds offered a sweet deal. The states and the federal government share the cost of Medicaid, but the feds paid a lot more for Medicaid expansion enrollees, matching 100 percent of the states’ costs for the first three years, with a plan to phase down to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond.  (Compare that with traditional Medicaid enrollees, whose costs are only partly matched by the federal government based on a formula tied to the state’s wealth. Richer places such as New York get a 50 percent match for Medicaid, while the feds pay poorer states like Mississippi up to 73 cents for every Medicaid dollar they spend.)    The ACA’s Medicaid push was a huge success. Of the 20   who got health insurance through Obamacare, at least half of them got it as a result of Medicaid expansion. Now these folks are in jeopardy. Again, in 2020, the federal government will end Medicaid expansion. At the individual level, that means ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees would be covered until December 31, 2019  —   assuming states don’t drop expansion before then in anticipation of the coming cuts.  Then in 2020, when Medicaid expansion ends, their health insurance status wouldn’t be secure anymore.  The government would only continue to match spending on the ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees who maintained continuous Medicaid coverage by staying below 138 percent of the federal poverty line. In practice, the continuous coverage requirement would mean a lot of people dropping from the program or facing a huge disincentive to earn more, said  Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard health care researcher. “It’s a stealth attack on Medicaid expansion,” he said. ”The reality is people move in and out of Medicaid a lot as they go between jobs, or their seasonal income goes up and down. ”   4) The plan gets rid of Medicaid expansion for children living in poverty   It’s not just adults living in poverty who will get hurt by this plan. It’s kids too.   As Vox’s Dylan Matthews reports, the new plan would change how Medicaid and CHIP, (the Children’s Health Insurance Program) work together for children.     Prior to the enactment of the ACA, there were a bunch of different income levels qualifying children of different ages for Medicaid. This meant a lot of confusion for families, who might have some kids in a household on Medicaid, and others on CHIP. The ACA expanded the eligibility rule by setting a uniform 133 percent of poverty Medicaid threshold for kids. The result was that a lot of kids moved from CHIP  —   which can charge premiums  —   to Medicaid, and families finally had their kids on one health insurance plan.  The AHCA would allow states to reverse that change, and the result will likely be moving kids back to the less generous CHIP program. “This is particularly concerning,” Matthews explained, “because CHIP funding is still slated to expire in September of this year, unless Congress acts. ”  5) People living in “trigger states” are going to fare particularly badly There are even more immediate risks to Medicaid expansion in some states. Eight of the 32 states (including DC) that expanded Medicaid under the ACA included language in their laws that said they’d only continue with the program as long as the federal government paid for most of it.  These “trigger states” were Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington. And in these places, Medicaid enrollees would be in particular jeopardy if the AHCA passes.  According to analysts at Georgetown University, if the AHCA were to pass, the trigger states could drop 3. 3 million people from Medicaid in 2020 or revoke some of their benefits, depending on the language in the state’s legislation. (This is unlike the other states that expanded Medicaid, which might keep on ACA Medicaid enrollees so long as they maintained continuous coverage.)    6) For the first time, the plan caps spending on Medicaid  —   which will inevitably lead to cuts  Right now the federal government matches all the dollars states spend on Medicaid, based on the needs of people on the program. But Republicans are proposing a new funding approach, to kick in in 2020, whereby the feds will only match Medicaid spending to a certain fixed amount. If states exceed that cap to cover the needs of enrollees, they’re on the hook for 100 percent of their Medicaid costs. Researchers project the change will amount to a $280 billion cost shift to states over 10 years. Because Medicaid spending can fluctuate a lot year to year  —   depending on the cost of drugs, for example, or any health crises that arise  —   a cap system like this could be really punishing to state economies. And this will most certainly put governors in the position of having to pare down Medicaid services, limit coverage, or drop people from the program altogether. Medicaid researcher Joan Alker called this a politically “ingenious part of the Republican plan” because it’ll shift the burden to the governors to decide what to do to balance their books, and they’ll get blamed for the coverage losses that ensure. “They are going to have to raise taxes, cut services, or cut people off,” she added.  7) The plan discontinues retroactive medical bill coverage for the poor There’s another stealth attack on Medicaid enrollees in the new GOP plan: It will also discontinue a program that got the medical bills of people who signed up for Medicaid covered retroactively for 90 days.  Under the ACA, people’s coverage extended back three months from before they enrolled in Medicaid. This was designed to protect people living in poverty who may end up in the hospital or sick with a lot of medical bills and only then learn that they were eligible for the program.  The GOP plan includes details that’ll undo this rule: People would only be eligible to get claims covered from within the same month in which they made their Medicaid application. This means that if they happen to apply for Medicaid at the beginning of the month, after racking up hospital charges for expensive treatments the month or months prior, they’ll be on the hook for all those bills. It’s another subtle change that’ll clearly sting people. ",-1.0

"Hillary Clinton has eased one of the biggest doubts about her capacity to be a good president.  As Donald Trump undertakes his second major campaign shakeup of the summer, it’s worth reflecting on the remarkable stability of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 quest for the presidency. Campaign chair John Podesta is exactly where he was a year ago. So are policy point man Jake Sullivan, communications director Jennifer Palmieri, spokesperson Brian Fallon, and basically everyone else.    The campaign is bigger than it was a year ago, with more field organizers and regional offices and an   digital team. But fundamentally the team was put in place back when Joe Biden was seen as Clinton’s main rival for the Democratic nomination. The difference is stark: Trump appears to be running a pirate ship with endless mutinies on board while Hillary Clinton is running a   battleship. It’s difficult to report on a negative, and the fact that Clinton’s campaign hasn’t been the scene of staff turmoil,   infighting, and damaging leaks is in some ways the definition of a nonstory.    But her 2008 campaign was all of these things, and her success in reinventing herself as the leader of a ”no drama” operation in the mold of Barack Obama’s campaign style is a genuinely surprising subplot to a campaign that’s been full of surprises.    Clinton’s 2008 campaign was a leaky mess Hillary Clinton not only lost the 2008 primary, she did so in a way that raised serious doubts in many people’s mind as to whether she was capable of managing any kind of   organization. Management problems were visible to even the most casual observers, as in her   firing of campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle after losing the Iowa caucuses. But beyond difficulty settling on which subordinates she really wanted, Clinton struggled to properly empower her campaign team  —   frequently circumventing the formal campaign structure to consult with longtime family friends like Sid Blumenthal and Mark Penn, and maintaining a highly ambiguous role for her husband who served as an often counterproductive surrogate on the trail.    The sprawling and unfocused Clinton campaign apparatus was constantly leaking to the press, ensuring that every decision she made was greeted by a chorus of  . The campaign was, obviously, not well run  —   especially in contrast to the disciplined and focused Obama operation. But when Josh Green sat down to report a   retrospective on the frontrunner’s collapse for the Atlantic he discovered that it ”was even worse than I’d imagined.”     The anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved Beltway wise men. Surprisingly, Clinton herself, when pressed, was her own shrewdest strategist, a role that had never been her strong suit in the White House. But her advisers couldn’t execute strategy; they routinely attacked and undermined each other, and Clinton never forced a resolution. Major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt, driving her staff to panic and misfire.  When controversy surrounding Clinton’s email management practices as secretary of state began to swirl in the spring of 2015, for many it brought back memories of this deeply flawed Clinton operation. Jonathan Chait wrote in March of that year about ”the larger question of whether Clinton is capable of managing a competent campaign (and thus, in turn, a competent administration).” He reflected that not only did the email imbroglio itself reflect highly questionable staff work, but the content of the some of the Clinton emails seemed to show a continued inability to impose a viable management structure. ”After her appointment as secretary of state, she sought to hire Sidney Blumenthal, one of the longtime loyalists who fed her most paranoid and   tendencies,” Chait wrote. ”The Obama administration blocked this appointment. Clinton went on getting advice from him anyway.” Clinton’s 2016 team broke with the past The early development of Clinton’s 2016 team clearly reflected a desire to break with the legacy of mismanagement that plagued her 2008 effort. Most of the key people from that campaign didn’t come back for a second tour of duty. Instead, the campaign’s senior personnel were either (like Podesta and Palmieri) less tied to her personally than to the Democratic Party institutionally or else (like Sullivan) relative newcomers to Clintonworld who’d done well at the State Department. It was a highly professional operation full of   political operatives, mostly   by service in an Obama administration that prided itself on an   absence of drama and scandal.    It seemed like the right way to go, but to many outsiders  —   okay, to me  —   it seemed almost too good to be true. Was Hillary really going to count on this team to see her through thick and thin, or was the official campaign staff going to be rapidly overruled by   communications with Howard Wolfson, Penn, Blumenthal, and whoever else at the first sign of trouble? And yet she either really has stuck with the core formal campaign team or else has at least imposed enough discipline on herself and her circle that she appears to have done so as far as any political journalist or consumer of political journalism is aware. Clinton hasn’t reinvented herself or become an entirely different person. She’s still secretive,   and nontransparent in a way that keeps her trapped in a cycle of unusually hostile press coverage. But this time around she seems to be genuinely executing on the strategy of calm. Clinton’s campaign operates like something resembling a black box. Decisions that can’t possibly have been unanimous are made, and nobody on the outside hears who disagreed or why. Clinton has been tested  —   but only a little One difference, of course, is that in politics it’s a lot easier to look good while you’re winning than while you’re losing. This time around, Clinton has been consistently winning. We can’t really know whether she would have stayed the course had she fallen behind Bernie Sanders in the delegate count or if Donald Trump had opened up a persistent national polling lead.    We can certainly say that Sanders surprising on the upside didn’t lead to a panic. Indeed, in January, Politico carried a report by Glenn Thrush and Annie Karni hinting that a major staff shakeup was in the offing if Clinton lost New Hampshire, but it never happened even though she got creamed. Whatever doubts Clinton may have expressed to friends who talked to Politico, nothing came of it. And there were no more rumors of staff shakeups even as Sanders proved frustratingly difficult to put away. Perhaps more significantly, her team stayed the course throughout the July period when Trump largely closed the polling gap and had many liberals alarmed. The Clinton team’s theory was that Trump was benefitting from party unity and that a strong show of support for Clinton from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic convention would accomplish the same for her  —   and they stuck with that theory. Probably not every single person in Clinton’s orbit agreed with it, but whoever had doubts kept them to themselves, they executed the strategy, and it worked. To an extent, of course, old worries about Clinton’s management skills are moot at this point. Put next to Donald Trump, basically anyone would look like a   politician capable of running a polished, professional campaign organization. But while elections are a   game, governance is not. People who remember her 2008 campaign with alarm can take at least some solace in the fact that she seems to have improved on her weaknesses.  This election is about normal vs. abnormal    ",-1.0

"Why Porzingis-Chandler confrontation is a good sign for Knicks. With 2:18 left in the game Saturday night at the Garden, Kristaps Porzingis was walking toward the Knicks’ bench during a timeout when he was bumped by Tyson Chandler.  It seemed innocent, but Porzingis took offense to the nudge, stopping to glare and go    with Chandler before players and officials stepped between them. It didn’t go beyond that, but it still was a good sign for the Knicks, who need every ounce of toughness they can muster during this difficult stretch of their season.  “That was nothing,” Chandler, a former Knick, said afterward. “I was walking to the bench and our paths crossed. I think he’s a great young player with a bright future. ” The Knicks went on to suffer another demoralizing loss, a   kick to the gut from the Suns, when Carmelo Anthony’s   try at the buzzer rimmed in and out. It was their 13th loss in their past 16 games and dropped their record to  . “It is obviously tough,” Porzingis said. “We all want to win and we all want to be successful. I think we are growing as a team and doing the right things. We aren’t there yet. We aren’t that good. ” Let’s face it. Amid all the losing, the   failures and the Melodrama, the most important news surrounding the Knicks these days is the health of Porzingis’ Achilles tendon. There has been and will continue to be plenty of discussion about whether Anthony should be traded or remain a Knick. But there is little question Porzingis is the foundation of the Knicks’ future. That is why missing four games with tendinitis in his Achilles was the last thing the Knicks needed. It is the kind of injury that can linger and lead to other injuries when an athlete tries to play through the pain.  Judging from his performance Saturday night, Porzingis is ornery and on the mend, which is easily the best news the Knicks can have at this juncture of a thus far disappointing season. Porzingis scored 14 points, including 10 in the third quarter, when the Knicks rallied from a   halftime deficit to force a   deadlock heading into the final 12 minutes. The Knicks eventually lost against a team that entered with just 13 wins. “We aren’t able to finish those games yet,” Porzingis said. “I think we’re competing hard. This is a challenge. We are trying to stay in it and hopefully these close games will come our way soon. ” Give Porzingis credit for trying. After looking tentative in the opening quarter, he showed more mobility in the second, running the floor, chasing rebounds and looking to block shots. At one point in the fourth quarter, he took the ball from the top of the key and tried to drive to the basket. He was stripped of the ball, but the effort was credible. A minute later, Porzingis came streaking across the court and leaped high in the air to block a shot by Brandon Knight, only to be called for goaltending. He was the perfect complement to Anthony (31 points) and Derrick Rose (26) who did most of the heavy lifting. Porzingis’ effort followed his   performance against the Wizards on Thursday night, when he came off the bench and was    from the field with just two rebounds. Against the Suns, he managed just one rebound while starting, a statistic that must improve, but he made 7 of 13 shots. What the Knicks need to be cautious about is not having him do too much too soon. With their record the way it is, it would be easy to overextend Porzingis. He played 33 minutes Saturday after playing 29 minutes against the Wizards. It’s clear the losing is starting to wear on the Knicks. But the one thing they can’t lose is Porzingis.",1.0
"Mirabelle is the new crown jewel of downtown dining.   This review appeared in The Washington Post’s 2017 Spring Dining Guide as No. 1 on a list of the year’s 10 best new restaurants.        1. Mirabelle   Not yet rated  One of the many reasons you need to make time for Mirabelle, the new bauble from prolific restaurateur Hakan Ilhan: No Washington chef proves more meticulous than Frank Ruta. Take the vegetables in his dish of veal tongue; the carrots and spinach taste as if each had been pampered by their own kitchen minder. Equally impressive is the former White House chef’s boudin blanc, cloudlike in texture and whispering of juniper in its seasoning. The icing on the cake at one of the most fetching dining rooms in town (love the leather walls) is the presence of a dessert trolley outfitted by pastry chef Aggie Chin, whose butterscotch cremeux is the richest pudding in town, and     attention, thanks to wine and service director Jennifer Knowles. The competition should be nervous. Prepare to drop some serious money, but also to be dazzled.  Previous: Mintwood Place | Next: Mitsitam Native Foods Cafe   900 16th St. NW.   . mirabelledc. com.

Mirabelle       The following was originally published March 24, 2017.   Mirabelle, on the fast track to sublime  Let me cut to the chase: It’s great to see two of Washington’s most respected talents, former Grill Room chef Frank Ruta and pastry maven Aggie Chin, cooking together again, at the   Mirabelle. Georgetown’s loss is downtown’s gain. And what a lovely dining room! Mirabelle looks like no other, appointed with   tufted leather walls, opulent lighting and semicircular booths just waiting for food lovers to sink into the cushions. There’s music, but it’s unobtrusive. As a design pal said over lunch, Mirabelle “makes you feel like you’re in a   place. ” Equally sublime is the corner location, two blocks from the White House. Get the right seat and you can see the top of the Washington Monument. One can only imagine what a crowd there will be once the front patio opens. (Dinner service commences April 3.) Bon, bon, bon. But what most captured my attention as I eased into lunch earlier this week was the   Ruta pays to every ingredient on a plate and in a bowl.     Tasmanian Sea Trout is house smoked with fennel panna cotta and marcona almonds. (Dixie D.   The Washington Post)     Aggie Chin’s layered crepe cake with yuzu marmalade, sesame cream and caramel sauce. (Deb Lindsey   The Washington Post)    The greens in a spring salad taste as though each leaf and tiny vegetable had been plucked from some garden in California, then misted with a sherry vinaigrette made luscious with hazelnut oil and local honey. Glazed boudin blanc  —   basically a cloud whipped up from chicken, foie gras and cream  —   is the best around, served with braised red cabbage and white raisins, tangy as pickles. (The mystery flavor in the sausage is juniper.) Bites of pike tempura become part of an emerald soup when an intense watercress puree, thickened with tapioca, is added to the bowl. Tongue, as in veal, has my heart, however. Slices of the braised meat share a bowl of broth with poached foie gras and gorgeous bites of carrot and spinach, each tasting as if fussed over by their own attendant and pronounced in flavor. The broth, so clear you could read through it, gets its strength from oxtail and other bones. The entree is washed back with a rosé made by King Family Vineyards in Monticello country, a tip of the hat to Virginia and a chance to give a   to wine and service director Jennifer Knowles, formerly of the nearby Plume and the  Inn at Little Washington . The mantra she shares with her staff reveals itself to guests: “Be intuitive, purposeful, attentive, genuinely kind, confident. ” The competition would be wise to copy the sentiment. Five sandwiches, including ham with butter and a hamburger, are “an American thing,” says Ruta, the recipient of a James Beard Award for his cooking a decade ago. Plus, he adds, “we like baking bread. ” Meals are paced as though no one has to rush back to work, but some of us do. Maybe we should see the dessert list?    The dining room setting at Mirabelle is like no other in downtown Washington. (Deb   The Washington Post)  The selections are rolled to the table on the kind of cart you see in fancy establishments in Paris, which is where Chin says she was inspired by the “tableside aspect” in some of the finer establishments she and Ruta explored on a   R&D trip in November. On the cart at Mirabelle sit enticements including tarte Tatin, butterscotch cremeux and a jar of caramels and nougat: “A visual cue to help you make decisions,” announces a server. I’m drawn to a pale yellow “cake” made with 20 layers of crepes, each slathered with a veneer of yuzu marmalade and sesame seed cream. A twist on   the soothing confection comes with a delicate crackle, from crushed sesame tuiles in several layers, and becomes more indulgent with a swipe of buttery caramel sauce. My maiden meal was not flawless. If you want bread, you have to ask for it, and an entree of halibut on a bed of soft beans and diced carrots, while technically correct, proved a bit of a snooze at the party. While beautiful, the watercress soup could have used a pinch less salt. And for such a rich restaurant, the tables, covered in white damask tablecloths and not much else, look severe. Mirabelle has two meanings, says Chin. One of them refers to the yellow plum of northeastern France, prized for its sweetness. The other definition translates to “wondrous beauty,” which even at this early stage sounds appropriate for the best thing to happen downtown in seasons. ",-0.5
"Seriously, It's Time to Lean Into Monowheels. For a brief moment in human history, we thought we knew how to make a vehicle. Stick a drivetrain in a frame, slap two to four wheels on it, and hop on. The resulting form factors—cars, bicycles, tricycles, mopeds—have worked for 200 years, and much longer if you count the horse-drawn carriage among such devices. But for some, it was never quite enough. There had to be a way to optimize the model even further. What if, stability be damned, we could travel on just one wheel alone? Humans have been designing and riding ridiculous means of transit since the dawn of the machine age. The penny farthing. The dicycle. The Segway. But the concept of the monowheel has persisted through every fad and technological breakthrough. The notion has woven its way, on its single spinning pie plate, through the public consciousness for over a century. But now, thanks to technological advancements like self-balancing systems and powerful electric motors, the monowheel has gone from a fringe curiosity to a legitimate means of transportation. Monocycles were born as unwieldy, impossible things. One of the first known designs, from the 1860s, is a complicated contraption with one huge outer wheel, connected to multiple smaller inside wheels that were pedaled by a human operator who sat in the middle of it all. That same basic idea—a person sitting, like a gerbil, inside a giant wheel—persisted as others tried to make it a viable way of getting across town. But while the designs could vary widely, they all shared a common feature: Every one of them toppled over with ease. “It’s an inherently unstable form factor,” says micromobility expert Oliver Bruce. He’s a New Zealand native who advises governments and regulators on new vehicles for Micromobility Industries. He says the personal vehicle revolution is more likely to be led by scooters and e-bikes, though he doesn’t discount the appeal of the single-wheeler. “I think there's something kind of clean about it,” Bruce says. “There’s almost a magic to it. It brings out something that’s almost intangible.” As impractical as monowheels are, they have come to serve as visual shorthand for outlandish futurism. They graced many a cover of Popular Science magazine through the 1920s and '30s. They pop up in sci-fi franchises like Star Wars, Jurassic World, and Men in Black to signify a  more technologically advanced world beyond our own. But in the last decade, our own world has been catching up. The new vanguards of the single wheel focused less on making human-sized hamster balls and more on making smaller, more maneuverable personal transportation. Bruce attributes the current viability of the micro-monowheel to a confluence of technological advancements. “One-wheels have existed for a long time,” Bruce says. “Why did they not take off in the '20s? Because they're really hard to ride. They’re weird vehicles. But if you have a good-quality powertrain and some sort of computation that can help remove some of that steep learning curve, then it makes it easier for these vehicles to take off and for people to be able to use them.” As the cost of building rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and electric motors has plummeted, it has become feasible to assemble personal vehicles that are both powerful and compact. Gyroscopes and accelerometers have become easy to source, thanks to smartphones. Segway, despite all its shortcomings, advanced the cause with its self-balancing technology. In 2004, Canadian inventor Trevor Blackwell used that technology to create a self-balancing “Eunicycle.” Inventor Shane Chen, who also created the electric standing unicycle Solowheel, created the first hoverboard in 2012. It soon exploded in popularity (and sometimes just exploded). From there, the micro-monowheel was ready to roll, so to speak. “I could not have made a gas-powered Onewheel,” says Kyle Doerksen, CEO of Future Motion and inventor of the Onewheel board. “It just wouldn't have been possible until, you know, we had certain building blocks available.” If you somehow haven’t seen one before, the Onewheel looks like a skateboard, but with one fat tire plunked directly in the middle of the board. You plant your feet on the deck on either side of the wheel and lean the direction you want to go. Internal sensors adjust your speed depending on how much of your weight shifts forward or backward. Future Motion commercially launched the Onewheel in 2016. Doerksen declined to provide hard sales numbers, but he says that since launch the company has amassed “many tens of thousands of people” who ride Onewheels. For Onewheel riders like Chris Romine, his devotion stems from the unique experience the rideable offers. “In an odd way, the single wheel is both the Onewheel’s best feature and biggest detraction,” Romine says. Romine lives in Petersburg, Alaska, where he routinely Onewheels himself around. He got into the device because he saw it as the closest way to replicate the experience of snowboarding. He says he rides between 300 and 400 miles per month on a Onewheel. “Once you get good with a Onewheel, you really never have to get off until you’re walking in the door of wherever you’re going,” Romine says. “Other devices don’t have that degree of usability.” That usability comes with risks. Wrecking is seen as almost a rite of passage of Onewheel ownership. Take a look at the community’s subreddit and it feels like every third post is another newly humbled rider displaying the gory aftermath of their recent “nosedive.” Smooth riding comes with a learning curve. Adherents say that’s to be expected, of course. “Why do we stand up on two legs?” Doerksen says. “That's really hard and computationally intensive. You know, we're not as fast as a cheetah, but there's a lot of benefits to being up in a position that maybe has to fight physics a little bit but has a bunch of upsides.” Adventurous riders like Romine approach this kind of device with the knowledge that things can get gnarly quick. But for single-wheels to reach a wider audience, they need to appeal to people who would rather just hop on and get moving than learn a whole sport. Namely, people just trying to get to work. If cities are the future of humanity, then micromobility is the future of cities. Road infrastructure has largely failed to accommodate the influx of cars that swarm over them. Electric personal vehicle use has exploded as people search for ways to conquer that last mile of their commute. Cities looking to support their burgeoning populations are learning that their streets need to be reconfigured to prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and small electric vehicles—single-wheelers included. Electric unicycles, like the kinds made by InMotion and King Song, are designed for the commuter. The rider stands upright, facing forward as they zoom down the street (or, if they’re terrible people, the sidewalk), the single wheel spinning around between their ankles. Jeff Wills is the experience director at Electric Unicycle Collective (EUCO), an organization of unicycle evangelists that aims to educate riders and advocate for the proliferation of the devices. (The organization also helps sell them.) Wills sees the electric unicycle as an antidote to the congestion that clogs city roads. “I think in the future we're going to look back at this time and it's going to be one of those things that’s hard to explain to our kids that we all spent so much time in our cars in traffic,” Wills says. He adds, “Life becomes so impersonal when you are going to work every day and not interacting with people. Once you start to experience life from your feet again it is profound. It is life changing.” Despite the passion they inspire, there’s a lot working against the monowheel. Physics, for one, but also that fairly steep learning curve to operate them. It’s not usually intuitive for a person to balance on an object that has one relatively narrow point of contact on the ground while they hurtle forward at 20 mph. People like Doerksen and the folks at EUCO say it’s no harder than learning to ride a bike, but the mini-monowheel’s complexity is still a liability for widespread adoption. Especially when dead-simple devices like electric scooters literally litter the streets. “I think you will see companies migrating from things that are harder toward the direction of things that are easier to ride,” says Robert Bigler, CEO of Hoverboard Technologies. Hoverboard manufactured the GeoBlade, a single-wheeled board that resembles a Onewheel, aside from the much skinnier tire at the center. They sold well at first, but in recent months the company has suspended manufacturing the GeoBlade. Hoverboard Tech hasn't gone out of business, Bigler says, it's trying to figure out whether it makes sense to base the business around a single-wheeled device. “It's the quintessential form of transportation,” Bigler says. “But people just don't want to go through that learning curve.” If you look at the monowheel in terms of its newfound high-tech status, it serves as an embodiment of the Silicon Valley ethos: Take something with structure, strip it down to its most core function, then build it back into something different. And then make it light up, probably. So what if its basic usage relies on complicated software and internal machinery to achieve the same result we get from a bicycle? It’s cool, damn it! This desire to move around on a single wheel is a desire for simplicity and impossibility at the same time. Perhaps that comes from defiance—a rejection of human limitations that drives us to transcend our bipedal existence. “Instead of us conforming to the shape of a seat in a car or riding a bike, this is actually the next step in transhumanism,” Rose Wang, the founder of EUCO says. “We basically are human, but we are augmented by machines. This is really pushing us toward that direction, where we're not just interfacing with this machine, this machine actually becomes a part of us.” A niche shouldn’t be mistaken for a fad. The enduring allure of the monowheel captures the attention of enough people that it’s likely single-wheeled vehicles are here to stay for the long haul. If nothing else, they give us a glimpse of the oddities that the future of personal vehicles holds. Oliver Bruce, the micromobility expert, compares it to the prehistoric Cambrian Period, in which life on Earth evolved from simple-celled organisms into uncountable, wildly diverse lifeforms. “This is really like the tip of the iceberg in some ways, in terms of what is going to emerge,” Bruce says. “The Cambrian explosion of micromobility is coming. And it's just going to get weirder and weirder.”",0.0
"Ginsburg expresses ‘regret’ for remarks criticizing Trump.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Thursday that she should not have publicly criticized presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and that she would be more “circumspect” in the future to avoid commenting on partisan politics. The senior member of the Supreme Court’s liberal wing had criticized Trump in three separate media interviews since last week, calling him a “faker” and saying she feared for the country and the Supreme Court if he were elected.  Those comments  —   unprecedented in modern Supreme Court custom  —   brought criticism and questions over ethics even from usual allies, who said Supreme Court justices should not insert themselves into the elections. The judicial ethics code that binds   judges  —   but not Supreme Court justices  —   forbids judges from endorsing or speaking about candidates.  [Ginsburg, always outspoken, may have trumped herself]  In a statement issued Thursday by the court’s public information office, Ginsburg seemed to agree with the criticism, although she did not offer an apology to Trump, who had demanded one.   The Notorious RBG isn’t backing down from her negative comments about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and now he’s calling for her resignation from the Supreme Court. Here’s a quick rundown of what the two have said. (Jenny   Washington Post)   “On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were   and I regret making them,” Ginsburg said. “Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect. ” Last week, Ginsburg publicly slammed Trump and what his possible presidency would mean for the court. “I can’t imagine what this place would be  —   I can’t imagine what the country would be  —   with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told the New York Times. “For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be  —   I don’t even want to contemplate that. ” She made similar comments to the Associated Press. On Monday during a CNN interview, Ginsburg called Trump a “faker” and said she was surprised that the media has not pressed him more to release his tax returns.  [War of words between Ginsburg and Trump]   Trump quickly fired back, saying in a tweet that the    justice should resign and that her mind was “shot. ” He has not commented on her statement. Legal ethics experts had criticized Ginsburg, and some said her comments would raise recusal issues should litigation involving Trump arrive at the court.          Some will be mowing their lawn.

"Meet the New Hampshire newspaper publisher who’s at war with Donald Trump.    Correction: A previous version of this story said that newspaper publisher William Loeb endorsed Pete du Pont for president in 1988. In fact, Loeb had passed away; his wife, Nackey S. Loeb, was responsible for the endorsement.     MANCHESTER, N. H.  This courtship started like all the others. Back in March, two months before Donald Trump declared his candidacy and his war on Mexican “rapists,” he went to see Joe McQuaid, the publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader. The hallowed institution is the only statewide newspaper in New Hampshire. For six decades, ever since the Granite State began to host the     primary, McQuaid’s paper has been the loudest conservative voice in state politics. In every presidential cycle, local campaign directors send their candidates there, hoping to win the Union Leader’s endorsement. Trump, too, made the pilgrimage, took selfies with staffers and, in the fall, had lunch with McQuaid at the Derryfield Country Club here.  But the paper’s conservatism is of a traditional sort, and Trump is hardly Barry Goldwater (recipient of the Union Leader’s 1964 endorsement). In the end, McQuaid passed over Trump and endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the Republican race. Then, in December, he compared Trump to Biff, the cartoonishly evil tycoon from “Back to the Future Part II,” in a   editorial. Trump shot back, calling McQuaid a “lowlife” and a “loser. ” McQuaid parried, running a photo of Trump visiting his office in March and noting that, not long afterward, Trump called the paper “terrific. ” Another McQuaid editorial said that if Trump called him for campaign guidance again  —   something he seemed to do quite often, according to McQuaid  —   he’d give the billionaire advice that is “definitely not for printing in a family newspaper. ”    New Hampshire’s largest newspaper, the Union Leader, is the latest target of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (AP)   In a state primary that’s   a throwback to older traditions, McQuaid’s paper once represented immense political power. The Union Leader could make a candidate, and it has broken quite a few. Its founding publisher, William Loeb III, was less an operator than a political wrecking ball: He used his newspaper to demolish his enemies and build up his pets. Presidential candidates wooed him lest they fall into the former category and suffer the fate of Democrat Edmund Muskie, who, in 1972, appeared to cry in public while responding to particularly sharp Union Leader attacks on himself and his wife. The alleged tears  —   Muskie later said his face was wet from snow  —   effectively ended his presidential campaign.  A   later, things work differently. Here was Loeb’s successor, the supposed kingmaker, at war with the man leading New Hampshire by nearly 20 points. And though it’s exactly the kind of spat Loeb might have organized, the tolerance for venom from a   institution has dissipated. The quarrel was so unseemly that ABC News announced this month that it would boot the Union Leader as a   of the Feb. 6 Republican debate at St. Anselm College here  —   a revered event just three days before the primary. The Union Leader has hosted it many times before, despite its candidate endorsements; it was a potent reminder of its political influence. Yet it had gotten so carried away this time that ABC saw the paper more as a liability than an asset.  “The current war of words with Trump, coupled with the endorsement already made, put us in a difficult position,” an ABC executive wrote in an email to McQuaid. The network wanted all the candidates to feel that the partners were “not biased in favor of or against anyone on the debate stage. ” Within the hour, Trump was crowing about the decision on Twitter, writing, “I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. ”  The Union Leader ran an editorial condemning the ABC decision as “spineless,” but it was too late: ABC hadn’t even consulted with McQuaid before making the decision.  McQuaid can barely disguise his disdain for ABC’s logic, “which is, pardon the vernacular, absolute   . ” And yet there is nothing he can do to change or appeal the decision, one he feels was made not by the channel but the candidate. Trump, who was surging in New Hampshire despite spending very little time there, had clearly realized that it was pointless to participate in the state’s   primary rituals. After a couple of nods in McQuaid’s direction, Trump was able to kick the Union Leader even harder than the   paper had kicked past contenders.  It is, in a way, the 2016 campaign in miniature: angry, insurgent candidates discarding the traditions that once guided the presidential nominating contest. Like the Union Leader, New Hampshire (long a target of complaints and envy from states less instrumental to the winnowing process) is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Other states are moving up their primaries or banding together in blocs to leverage their power. Participation in the debates is dictated not by anything New Hampshire or Iowa set down but by national ratings. For a time last fall, the two candidates who’d spent the least amount of time in New Hampshire, Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson, were the ones with the most commanding leads here. Today, the wrecking ball is no longer the Union Leader but the candidate. The Union Leader’s tradition of thumbing the New Hampshire GOP primary scale was forged by William Loeb III, who bought the Manchester Union and the Evening Leader in 1946. Two years later, he fused them into the Manchester Union Leader. That same year, he bought out the New Hampshire Sunday News, which had been started by a former Union war reporter, B. J. McQuaid, father of Joe. The elder McQuaid would become the newly combined paper’s editor, but Loeb did the politicking. For someone interested in elections, it was a good time to snap up several newspapers: In 1952, New Hampshire became the site of the country’s first modern presidential primary, with candidates’ names on the ballot instead of delegates’. For Loeb, it was a windfall of influence and access. Joe Kennedy wined and dined him in an attempt to win support for JFK in the 1960 primary. Loeb refused and, after borrowing some money from a certain union to settle a lawsuit, he became a loyal backer of Jimmy Hoffa in the Teamsters’ battle against another Kennedy brother, Bobby. When the union boss was jailed, Loeb had a plane fly a banner through the skies in 1971 that read “FREE HOFFA NOW  —   WRITE PRES. NIXON. ” Nixon released Hoffa, apparently because Loeb had promised to endorse him in the 1972 New Hampshire primary. (He didn’t: Nixon went to China, rendering him a traitor in Loeb’s eyes.) After Joe Biden proposed giving senators a raise shortly after his election to that chamber in 1972, Loeb wrote in one of his famous   salvos that “the voters of Delaware who elected this stupid, conceited jackass to the Senate should kick him in the rear to knock some sense into him. ”  Loeb’s intervention has been credited with sealing the fates of a raft of gubernatorial and senatorial primary candidates, and there have been several presidential hopefuls who never governed, in part because Loeb made it his business to ruin them. In 1979, he was so intent on seeing Ronald Reagan win the crown that he dispatched his reporters to Illinois and Washington to write up rumors that Rep. Philip Crane, a young conservative threatening Reagan’s rise, was a womanizer. He had done something similar to Bobby Kennedy, sending staff all over the country to dig up as much dirt on the man as possible.  After Loeb’s death, the venom sloshing around the paper’s pages abated. His widow, a newspaper heiress named Nackey Scripps Loeb who took over as publisher, said that she’d rather use a needle where her husband had used a sword. Joe McQuaid, her successor, has been even less savage. “Since then, the Union Leader has not had much of an impact,” says Andrew Smith, head of the polling center at the University of New Hampshire. “It just doesn’t hold the weight that it did, because it wasn’t just about the endorsement; it was about the news coverage. McQuaid doesn’t have the vitriol that Bill Loeb had. ” McQuaid, born just outside town here in 1949, joined his dad’s paper as an office boy in 1965 and eventually dropped out of college to be a   Union Leader sports reporter, a job he was already doing on the side. The last straw at college was a journalism class in which the students critiqued one another’s work. “These kids are telling me what’s wrong with my stories,” McQuaid recalls. “And I finally asked one of them: ‘How much do you get for your stories? Because I get $100 a week for mine!’ ”  By 22, he was the Sunday editor, which involved taking down the spitfire editorials Loeb phoned in from his home in Massachusetts. (Loeb may have liked New Hampshire for its political oomph, but he lived in the state next door and, for tax purposes, was a legal resident of Nevada.) Loeb died in 1981, and after Nackey Loeb took over, she elevated McQuaid in 1982 to the top job his father had once occupied.  Despite his 66 years, Joe McQuaid still looks boyish  —   a mix of mischief and New England WASP humor. Because of his coveted endorsement and salty manner, he has become a staple of campaign reporting over the years. Each election cycle produces a series of stories about McQuaid, the ornery high priest, and he has the anecdotes and souvenirs to prove it. There’s the photo of him with Biden (whom the paper did not endorse) and the stories of having lunch with the Donald. There’s the anecdote about Reagan dropping by the Union Leader’s offices (the paper endorsed him twice). There’s the story of a young JFK pulling up a flatbed truck to the Union Leader’s offices on the eve of the 1960 primary and denouncing Loeb  —   to wild applause. (Other,   sources say Kennedy did this in a Manchester park, not outside the paper.)  McQuaid’s tenure has also coincided with the paper’s decline, and the Reagan visit helps show how. When Trump came in March to interview with McQuaid, who takes great pride in grilling the candidates to test their mettle, he was waylaid in the lobby, where about   of the Union Leader’s staff had gathered as word spread that Trump was in the building. Some wanted autographs, others wanted photos, but they all wanted to lay eyes on the man from television. Trump gladly obliged,   and posing. He turned to McQuaid, who had been watching all this from the side. “Is this the biggest turnout you’ve ever had here?” Trump asked. No, McQuaid responded. “Ronald Reagan was in here,” he said. “He drew a pretty big crowd. ” Even the biggest showstopper of 2016 couldn’t match the   buzz.  If the headquarters of the Union Leader look like a school, that’s because, in part, they are. The curving linoleum hallways filled with posters and illuminated by wan fluorescent lighting are split between the editorial staff on one side of the building and an elementary school on the other side, which was once the Union Leader’s circulation department. The circular structure was built in 1990 by Nackey Loeb around a printing press, the warehouse for which the paper is now trying desperately to rent out. New Hampshire’s only statewide paper is now printed   which McQuaid says costs millions of dollars a year less than running its own press. The press was sold for scrap, which almost covered the cost of getting it to the scrap yard, McQuaid says. The Union Leader, like so many of its local counterparts across the country, has seen better days. The paper that once set the political agenda for New Hampshire and, in presidential election years, for the entire nation has been worn down by the changing tides of media. First came local television, such as WMUR, which cut into the Union Leader’s dominance; then came the Boston networks and papers, which reached further and further into New Hampshire. Then came the Internet, which caused utter chaos at newspapers far more established and moneyed than the Union Leader. As New Hampshire increasingly becomes a Massachusetts bedroom community, Democrats outnumber the Union Leader’s core constituency: local Republicans. The paper with the biggest circulation in the state is now the Boston Globe, according to UNH’s Smith.  Today, the Union Leader’s print circulation hovers around 40, 000, about half of its heyday reach. The paper has migrated online, where McQuaid says it pulls in around 800, 000 monthly unique visitors, but according to ComScore, the media industry standard, the figure is closer to 160, 000. The people reading those   editorials are growing steadily older and out of pace with a younger, more liberal, more digitally oriented population. When the paper was growing, Loeb borrowed from people like Jimmy Hoffa to keep it in the black. Today, McQuaid resorts to different tricks: The Union Leader is now owned by the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications, which just loses money on it. “I don’t know if you’ve heard about newspapers lately?” McQuaid says with a grimace. “They’re not doing so well. And the stupid guy who runs the Union Leader can’t seem to make a profit. ” The school makes up the cash by renting space to other companies and hosting a fundraiser with a marquee speaker every year  —   another privilege of an early primary state.  With the proliferation of other media voices, the Union Leader’s edge is gone, even among local stalwarts. “The conservative voter in New Hampshire reads the Union Leader in the morning, listens to talk radio on their way to work and goes home and turns on Fox News,” says Dante Scala, who teaches political science at the University of New Hampshire. “The Union Leader now has to share its influence. ” That means its endorsement is also less meaningful, especially among a new class of politicians. “There’s a small circle in Manchester that thinks it’s really important, but the further out you get from Manchester, the more it’s just another paper,” says Jack Flanagan, the Republican majority leader in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. “Yeah, it’s nice to get the endorsement, but it’s just another trophy on the mantel. ”   When I met with McQuaid in his office in September, he was already mulling his anointment. The Union Leader may no longer be the state’s most powerful force, but candidates still show up to audition and flatter the maestro. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had just gamely endured the traditional   interrogation by McQuaid, his editorial writer and executive editor. As Graham’s handler tried to wrap up the session and hustle him out the door, Graham pleaded, “Can I have five more minutes?” “I’ll give you three and a half,” the aide said. “Where are we going?” Graham asked. “Can’t be nearly as fun as this!”  “I’ll tell you, papers are relevant,” the senator told McQuaid as they shuffled out of the room together, literally slapping each other on the back.  McQuaid relishes this role. Most of the time, he is a   newspaperman who covers school boards and local crime, but every four years, he becomes a power broker courted by the nation’s political celebrities. “What journalist wouldn’t like to have a personal conversation with a candidate for president every week?” says John E. Sununu, a Republican former senator from New Hampshire. McQuaid is protective of this legacy, which means having to be protective of the primary itself. It’s the only thing that, to the rest of the country, distinguishes New Hampshire from Vermont  —   and the thing that allows McQuaid to transform from backwater publisher to political swami.  “He’s a fierce defender of the New Hampshire primary,” says Tom Rath, a former state attorney general who often advises GOP presidential campaigns. “He thinks that New Hampshire does politics right. I think he likes the idea that you can take these huge campaigns and boil them down, and that none of that happens after the New Hampshire primary. After that, it’s all tarmacs and TV cameras. ”  This crowded campaign cycle has meant more love  —   and more flatterers such as Graham  —   than ever. “The value of the endorsement goes up the more candidates you have,” McQuaid told me. This is good for him and his paper, I noted. “Sure,” he said, “but it’s also good for the country. ” He quickly made sure to rub out the trace of  . “It’s not about whether I like it or not. It’s part of tradition. ” Yet the value of his endorsement has never been clear, and the changing primary has made it less powerful than ever.  McQuaid owes much of his reputation to the     he gave Sen. John McCain in 2008. The candidate, almost out of money, lay dying on the ropes; he had laid off most of his staff and was doing little more than   appearances. The Union Leader’s imprimatur led to a lifesaving transfusion of donations, reviving his candidacy and propelling him to victory in the GOP primary a month later. “The surprise endorsement came at such a critical juncture at his campaign,” says Mike Dennehy, who ran McCain’s New Hampshire operation. McCain was not the kind of movement conservative the newspaper usually backed, and Mitt Romney had a vacation home in New Hampshire. McQuaid’s support “gave McCain the jolt at the moment he needed it most,” Dennehy says. “It gave him the credibility he needed, with New Hampshire voters and with conservatives. ” He eventually won the nomination. But with that notable exception, the Union Leader’s record as kingmaker is muddled. Loeb, who endorsed candidates like John Ashbrook in 1972 and Pete du Pont in 1988, picked the eventual Republican nominee only twice: Nixon in 1968 and Reagan in 1980. McQuaid’s track record is even worse. In the 2000 campaign, he endorsed Steve Forbes. (George W. Bush, McQuaid told me, was an “empty suit, though he filled out the suit quite nicely after  . ”) McCain won the New Hampshire primary that year with 49 percent; Forbes came in third with 13 percent. In 2012, McQuaid picked Newt Gingrich, who, in McQuaid’s opinion, had “the experience, the leadership qualities and the vision to lead this country in these trying times. ” Gingrich placed fifth in New Hampshire with less than 10 percent. McQuaid’s horse this time, Christie, was averaging sixth place in polls in the state as of Wednesday, according to Real Clear Politics.  The losing record doesn’t faze McQuaid, though. “We’ve done better opposing people than proposing people,” he explains  —   a conveniently unfalsifiable claim. His approach in some ways mirrors the Republican Party’s: It’s not about predicting the winner or lifting a pol to the nomination. It’s about a subjective but platonic ideal. “It’s important to tell people who we think can do a good job,” McQuaid says. Trump smelled this by summer and suspected that he could begin disregarding McQuaid with impunity. “Knowing you as I do, I feel it is unlikely I will be getting the endorsement from you and the Union Leader,” Trump wrote to McQuaid in declining to participate in the paper’s Voters First Presidential Forum in August at St. Anselm College. The forum allowed any candidate to participate, unlike the networks’ habit of arraying competitors onstage based on their national poll numbers  —   a direct affront to the intensely local New Hampshire primary. Trump didn’t see the point: “I have made a great fortune based on instinct and that, unfortunately, is my view,” he went on in his letter to McQuaid. “Therefore, and for other reasons including the fact that I feel there are too many people onstage to have a proper forum, I will not be attending. ” It was a dagger at the Union Leader’s ability to command the attention of candidates.  Another tradition, also started by Loeb, is to “endorse every day,” which effectively means walloping those not lucky enough to win the Union Leader’s nod. To this day, McQuaid beams, “we hammer the hell out of the people we didn’t endorse”  —   both in the news pages and in the editorials. So even as McQuaid endorsed Christie, he couldn’t help jabbing Trump in the ribs. “Other candidates have [also] gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly,” McQuaid wrote. “But it’s important when you are telling it like it is to actually know what you are talking about. Gov. Christie knows what he is saying because he has experienced it. And unlike some others, he believes in what he says because he has a strong set of conservative values. ” This ignited the feud with Trump, and the more Trump attacked McQuaid and the Union Leader, the more McQuaid and the Union Leader blasted Trump. In choosing against the electorate’s instincts, the paper was giving admirable voice to its principles. But it also put the institution further out of step with voters each day. (To say nothing of the integrity of news coverage: New Hampshire political lore has it that Loeb let Reagan’s campaign manager write articles and headlines. McQuaid doesn’t allow Christie’s staff the same courtesy, but the Union Leader has faithfully chronicled his meetings with police chiefs and his exhortations that voters ignore polls. One recent piece, headlined “Christie tells voters to be wary of Trump,” was essentially a transcript of the governor’s town hall.) As for Trump’s war on “lowlife” McQuaid, the publisher shrugs. “At least he didn’t say I was low energy. ”  In the end, McQuaid sees the fortunes of the Union Leader linked inextricably with the fortunes of the New Hampshire primary  —   and he may not be wrong. Some knock the   complex, but to McQuaid it is a sacred custom that he is intent on preserving. He lamented ABC’s decision to boot the Union Leader not because he couldn’t   the debate (“It doesn’t hurt our brand,” he reassured me this month) but because it clearly disrespected New Hampshire’s method of picking a president.  McCain’s 2008 Lazarus moment in New Hampshire would never be possible today, McQuaid says, because of the way the Republican National Committee and the national media, not those   Granite State town halls, have powered this race. McCain would probably have suffered the fate of his pal Lindsay Graham, whose low poll numbers trapped him in the undercard debates until he slipped entirely from public view. “If they’re going to do this stuff based on the polling in friggin’ July, you’re not going to have anyone but Trump and Bush, the rich, famous guys,” McQuaid says, noting that he constantly berates his reporters for citing poll numbers too early in the race; he finds them meaningless. “It’s the party’s fault for being in collusion with the networks in making Trump the center of attention. I mean, in the debates he is literally the center of attention. ” And don’t even get him started on the networks, which give live coverage to Trump campaign events and then act surprised at his success. Then there’s the threat of other states trying to mimic  —   and supplant  —   New Hampshire’s primacy in the primary season. On March 1, a bloc of seven Southern states will hold a primary blitz, nicknamed the SEC Primary, hoping to attract candidates and to give themselves more say in picking the GOP nominee. “Yes, I do worry,” McQuaid says of the phenomenon. “New Hampshire has not always picked the winner, but it’s always sent a signal to the country that something is either right or wrong. ” This year, the country may no longer care about Granite State opinions on the subject. It’s all rather dismaying, except McQuaid’s upper lip is far too stiff to show it. “I don’t know, everything runs its course,” he says. As for the Union Leader, he’s not too worried: “If we’re declining in influence, why are you writing about me?” he asks. “I think I’m more optimistic about the future of the Union Leader than I am about the future of the New Hampshire primary!” And once that’s over, on Feb. 10 McQuaid and the Union Leader will go back to covering the local heroin epidemic, the high school basketball games, the snowy car crashes with police cruisers.  “We’re just little old New Hampshire, and in three weeks the parade will roll out of town, and we’ll be the Brigadoon again,” McQuaid says. “And we’ll sink back into the mists. ”  Twitter: @juliaioffe    Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.

"‘It goes well beyond Wells Fargo’: Concerns grow over sales tactics in banking industry.  For Oscar Garza, career success was measured one account at a time. The Chase personal banker said he had a month to persuade customers to open 40 checking or savings accounts and 15 credit cards. Meeting that goal would mean an extra $800, but failure could lead to his termination.  “You either do this or you’re out,” Garza said. The stakes were so high, Garza says, that his managers encouraged him to enter false income information or to accept questionable identification documents in order to speed approval for new accounts. Other times, he said, he would run a customer’s credit history without their permission to determine if they qualified for a credit card. Such   sales tactics  —   and worse  —   have become a new flash point in the debate over whether, eight years after the financial crisis, U. S. regulators are doing enough to hold Wall Street accountable for bad behavior. Wells Fargo, the country’s largest retail bank and an institution once thought above the fray of financial crisis era scandals, has been under fire this week after acknowledging it had fired 5, 300 employees over the past five years for opening as many as 2 million sham accounts customers didn’t ask for. The San   bank, which did not admit wrongdoing, agreed to pay a $185 million fine and now finds itself in the crosshairs of a possible criminal investigation by two different federal prosecutors.   The bank’s longtime chief executive, John Stumpf, is set to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday to explain how such a massive scheme was able to fester for years, and Wells Fargo’s troubles are now fodder for the presidential campaign trail. Wells Fargo is hardly alone in aggressively pushing accounts, industry veterans say. Consumers have filed more than 31, 000 complaints since 2011 about the opening, closing and management of their accounts and issues dealing with unauthorized credit cards, according to an analysis of complaints filed with the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The complaints name many of the nation’s largest institutions. The banks say many of the complaints are unfounded, or the result of identify theft. Few, they said, are related to outright fraud; some are complaints about unauthorized credit checks. Several institutions echoed Wells Fargo in saying they are regularly reviewing and improving their training and compliance programs to deter wrongdoing. But critics say consumers often are being steered into accounts and services they don’t need, fueled by a business culture that places unreasonable demands on employees to plug products in order to drive revenue at a time when banking margins are thin. “Extremely unreasonable sales goals and collection quotas” are the biggest issues facing bank employees, said Erin Mahoney, a coordinator for the Committee for Better Banks, a labor coalition made up of bank employees, community groups and unions that formed in 2013. “We have stories from every bank. It goes well beyond Wells Fargo. ” Efforts to combat the problem have been episodic, and few top executives have been held accountable. Regulators fined Santander Bank $10 million in July for working with a vendor that allegedly enrolled customers in overdraft protection services they never authorized. Last year, Citibank and its subsidiaries were ordered to pay $700 million to consumers for allegations they misrepresented the cost and benefits of credit card  . And PayPal was ordered to pay $25 million in fines and customer refunds for claims consumers were unknowingly given credit accounts. All three settlements contained no admission of wrongdoing. Taken together, such incidents expose a potential vulnerability in the nation’s banking system that has generated far less attention from authorities than, say, periodic warnings about the threat of cybercrime and identity theft. It’s not just outsiders who represent a threat, but   workers who have access to personal records. Garza, the former JPMorgan Chase banker, has recounted his experiences with lax oversight in various media accounts and in a June presentation before members of Congress. At the time he worked for the banking giant in Dallas, he said in an interview he made just $11 an hour. The bonus he could claim for reaching his monthly goals for new accounts helped keep him off public assistance. “You make a determination, a hard one, and say do I take this ID and meet my monthly quotas and put food on the table?” Garza said. After two years at the bank, Garza said he quit in 2013. He now works for a phone company. Chase said it has no record of problems with Garza and that its policy is to move swiftly to terminate employees who encourage illegal behavior. It said it uses sales targets to award bonuses, not to punish. “We reward our bankers for great customer experiences and when they help customers get products that they need and use,” said Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for Chase. At the center of the bad behavior appears to be an effort by banks to persuade customers to sign up for multiple products, known as “ . ” A customer who opened a checking account, for instance, would be encouraged to consider a credit card or savings account. Someone with a mortgage may be asked to open a checking account. The simple sales strategy became a profit center for many banks amid historically low interest rates and tighter banking industry regulations, analysts say. The “aggressive sales metrics and incentives programs” used by retail banks often encourage workers to sell products to customers even when they may not be a good fit or the paperwork is incomplete, the National Employment Law Project said in a report released this summer.  Ruth Landaverde, who spent five years as a customer representative and personal banker for Bank of America in Los Angeles, recalls a push from the company to move customers from checking accounts that charged no monthly fees to more complex accounts that did charge fees. “How is that going to benefit the client?” said Landaverde, 34, who also spent more than a year as a sales representative at Wells Fargo. She says she heard from several   customers who did not understand that the new accounts would charge fees. Others said they received credit cards they did not ask for. Landaverde was dismissed from Bank of America after she was investigated over questions about an account she opened for a friend. Bank of America declined to comment. Several banks insist their systems are sound. Some say many of the complaints filed with federal regulators stem from problems that originated with partners  —   an overly aggressive retail clerk, for instance, who signs up a customer for a store credit card that is ultimately managed by a bank. In some cases, customers complain about being issued cards they didn’t authorize when in reality the store just changed vendors, turning a store card from Visa into one from American Express, for instance. Wells Fargo is considered among the most aggressive in   services. It has long been known for an initiative known as “ ” or “Eight is Great,” reflecting its goal to have customers use an average of eight of its products, up from about six. “If we stay squarely focused on our customers,   them, helping them, we’ll win,”  Stumpf, the chief executive, said in a March 2010 speech to investors.  That push helped turn Wells Fargo into a Wall Street darling. The firm’s return on common equity  —   a key metric of profitability  —   stands at nearly 12 percent, compared with 7 percent at Citigroup and 10 percent at JPMorgan. “It has always stood out for financial performance and relatively little regulatory trouble,” said Erik M. Oja, an equity analyst for S&P Global Market Intelligence. But, according to court filings, that focus on   came with aggressive new sales goals. “In order to achieve its goal of selling a high number of ‘solutions’ to each customer, Wells Fargo imposes unrealistic sales quotas on its employees, and has adopted policies that have, predictably and naturally, driven its bankers to engage in fraudulent behavior to meet those unreachable goals,” stated a 2015 lawsuit filed by the Los Angeles city attorney.     Wells Fargo says it started to notice a problem, too. Starting in 2011, Wells Fargo officials say they recognized some of their employees were breaking the rules in order to meet sales goals. In some cases, the employee would create a phony email address  —   noname@wellsfargo. com was often used, according to regulators  —   in order to get credit for setting up an online account the customer didn’t request. Other times, the employees would take money from an established account and create a new one. It initially treated these cases as “employee misconduct,” a company spokeswoman said, firing the worker. But Wells Fargo soon realized customers were being harmed by the conduct, incurring maintenance charges and late fees for accounts they didn’t realize they had. Over the next four years, the bank says it fired roughly 1, 000 employees a year for such conduct and launched an aggressive effort to stamp out such behavior. “On average, 1 percent [of employees] have not done the right thing and we terminated them. I don’t want them here if they don’t represent the culture of the company,” Stumpf said in an interview. Wells Fargo officials have blamed rogue or   employees for the misconduct. But earlier this week, the bank said it would eliminate its sales goals by the end of the year, saying that while few employees crossed the line, it wasn’t worth the risk.  But the scale of the abuse, about 1 percent of the company’s workers every year, has stunned lawmakers and prompted calls for the company’s top executives to either step down or forfeit some of the millions in bonuses they earn every year. Stumpf, for example, made $19 million last year, including more than $10 million in performance pay. Now, many are asking how could problems have persisted for so long without top executives and regulators taking quicker action. “Where were the internal controls? This stuff was not sophisticated,” said Sheila Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. a banking regulator. “Why weren’t there red flags? Why weren’t they catching this?”  Aaron Gregg, Steven Rich and Alice Crites contributed to this report.    ",-0.5
"This little girl is so fragile, her bones break in the wind. A    girl’s bones are so delicate that sneezing could leave her with a broken rib and a simple fall could kill her. Zoe Lush, from Huntington Beach, California, suffers from a rare gene mutation called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which causes her to have extremely brittle bones. “Zoe is very fragile, she literally breaks in the wind. There have been some close calls but she astonishes us every single day,” Zoe’s mother Chelsea Lush told Barcroft. Zoe  —   who broke up to 100 bones before her first birthday  —   began falling apart when she was still in her mother’s womb. “We were doing   ultrasound and they were able to see her multiple fractures that were fresh and healing already. She had broken ribs, the arms and legs were about six weeks behind what they should have been and they told us that she had very severe condition and that she possibly wouldn’t make it until her birth date,” the mother said, adding that doctors suggested she terminate the pregnancy. Chelsea and her husband Curtis Lush went against doctors’ advice  —   a decision she does not regret  —   and Zoe was born by cesarean in October of 2010. Zoe was forced to stay in the hospital for one week and was given a treatment called “pamidronate” which strengthens the bones. Despite having treatment, her parents had to handle her so lightly upon taking her home that simple tasks like changing her diaper became a three person job. “One person to lift her pelvis, one person to slide the diaper in an out and then another person to hold her arms because babies have startle reflex,” Curtis said. “I was on arms duty and she startled in to my hand. Her radius just snapped  —   it sounded like a broken chicken bone. We had to learn a lot, very quickly,” he added. Now Zoe undergoes physical therapy to strengthen her muscles and provide support for her bones. Fractures still happen, but far less than they used to. She also had metal rods inserted into her limbs and a cervical spinal fusion. She currently wears a neck brace which her parents hope will be removed later this month. Despite her countless injuries, Zoe is a social butterfly who loves painting, baking, and playing like other children her age. One of her favorite hobbies is spending time with her    brother Felix. “She is able to do every other thing that other kids are, other than run on their feet but she can race them just as fast in her wheelchair,” Chelsea said. Zoe will struggle with her condition for her whole entire life, but her mother says she wouldn’t change one thing about her.

"A stint in Brussels was meant to enrich my kids. It also taught them about terror..      Tuesday morning, I was sitting in my home office in Brussels, working on my latest children’s book when a friend texted: “Holy cow. Preliminary reports indicate one or more explosive devices have gone off at Zaventem airport. ” I immediately looked out the window at my children’s Belgian school. It’s barely a hundred yards away, and every day, rain or shine, the children enjoy a full hour of recess plus a     break. One of the luxuries of my life here is that I’m able to hear the happy sounds of children playing on the other side of my garden wall  —   including my    son and    daughter. This time, it was a relief to hear quiet, to know that the children were still inside. Police and ambulance sirens began to shriek in the distance, but it was easier than I thought to stay calm  —   at least at first. The airport is a   drive from my house. Then another friend texted: “You heard about the explosion at the metro stop?” The Maalbeek metro station was just over a mile away. Now my mouth had gone dry. What was next? I threw a sweater over my pajama top, pulled on jeans and boots, and ran to my children’s school. *** Nine months earlier, we had flown from Dulles to Zaventem to begin a new chapter of our lives. Our party included my husband, the children, my    mother, our    cat and me. Our unofficial slogan was “What could go wrong?” My son vomiting from one side of the Atlantic to the other while the cat yowled in despair under the seat made the list, but terrorism was nowhere on it. While we were certainly aware of Brussels’s supporting role in a number of recent terror attacks, including on Charlie Hebdo, its status as a   European capital made it seem safer than Paris or London. If anything, its danger seemed more as an Island of the Lotus Eaters, where we might end up gorging on beer and frites with functionaries of minor European nations then wake up 20 years later, having missed all the action back in the States. But even this wasn’t such a horrible fate. After all, part of what I hoped to leave behind in America was the culture of anxiety: I was tired of helicopter parenting, of   academic pressure, of partisan political hysteria, of gun violence. I wanted to worry a little less and enjoy life a little more, and above all, I wanted the same for my children so they’d end up more independent and less neurotic than me. Plus, what Brussels lacked in excitement, it made up for with its proximity to cooler places. As one of our friends put it, “The best thing about Brussels is the 5:45 train to Paris. ” Then in August, just as we finally had a chance to take that train, a terrorist attacked it. We were already in Paris, on our first vacation, when we heard about the gunman who had boarded the Thalys in Brussels and attempted to shoot up the passengers before American service personnel tackled him. We decided not to tell the kids  —   at least until we safely made the same trip back home two days later. But it wasn’t easy to hide our jitters or downplay the presence of the heavily armed police patrolling the train. Three months later, terrorists attacked Paris itself. We watched images of the carnage in horror, sent worried messages to our friends there, but we still felt out of harm’s way. Then it emerged that the attacks had been planned in Brussels. So a week after Paris, we woke up to discover that our town was under lockdown. Authorities cautioned us to stay inside as they conducted raids and  —   in a purely Belgian touch  —   urged us to tweet cat pictures instead of the details of police activity. Our original “What could go wrong?” slogan seemed far less amusing as the raids spread across Brussels and into our own neighborhood. Our supposedly dull adopted city had turned into Europe’s most dangerous terrorist hub. As the authorities combed Brussels for Salah Abdeslam, the fugitive Paris bomber, I found myself back in a version of New York, where I had lived during the   attacks. For four days that fall, we stayed inside, monitored terror alert levels and made nervous forays to the closest open store, gawking at the armed soldiers in military vehicles. But unlike back in New York, I now had children, and the city’s schools were mentioned as a possible target. Naturally, I did not share this disturbing information with the kids, but with schools closed, I had to tell them something. I finally explained that the police were looking for “a bad man” and repeated a lesson I had given them in   Hook America and had hoped never to have to give in Europe: what to do in an   situation. When school finally reopened four days later, a police officer was stationed outside the door and parents were no longer allowed to enter the building. This gave me some sense of security, but I still gathered after   with a group of mostly American mothers to try to calm our nerves. We ended up discussing the best way to stage our own raid if our kids’ schools were attacked. Not exactly the kind of carefree European morning at the cafe I had once imagined. In the weeks that followed, there was a   edginess to our lives: a quicker reflex when we heard a loud noise; an occasional moment of gut unease, such as when I took the children into a crowded Christmas market tent only to discover that it had only one entrance and a distant exit. At the last minute, the authorities canceled the traditional New Year’s fireworks festivities. We hadn’t planned to go, but it was another reminder that the authorities considered the city a crime scene waiting to happen. As the weeks passed, however, this became our new normal. The children became used to seeing armored vehicles outside our local park. We avoided large public gatherings but eventually went back to our favorite farmer’s market, the kids unfazed by the soldiers patrolling it with machine guns. Eventually, I started taking the metro again. When friends from Washington decided to meet us in Holland for spring break, citing concerns over security in Belgium, we thought they were being overly cautious. When, stuck in a cab in traffic, I saw a police helicopter overhead, the driver and I calmly decided it was probably just another   raid.  . A few days later, when Abdeslam, the suspect in the Paris attacks, was apprehended after his fingerprints were discovered in the raid, it seemed that the worst was over. Then the terrorists struck. *** Part of the dream of every   is that, in leaving your country behind, you can also leave behind a part of yourself. And I do worry less about certain things here: my children’s education, the quality of the food, our health care and financial security. The children have become more confident and independent. (My    recently went on a   class trip to the seaside, a positive experience that she’d never have back in the United States.) But as the world grows smaller, as our actions and problems become more intertwined, it seems impossible to leave anxiety and terror behind. By the time I arrived at my children’s school on Tuesday, a small group of parents was waiting by the door. The director of the school unlocked it to talk to us. Her son had flown out of Zaventem a few hours before the bombing, and she looked shaken. She told us that, if we liked, we could take our children home. I found my daughter in the nursery school building, then my son in gym class. He was in the middle of learning a dance the kids were going to perform at the end of the year. “What’s happening?” they asked. “Why are we going home?” As I held their hands tight and walked them quickly home, sirens screaming in the distance, I told them that there had been attacks in Brussels. “Like Paris?” my son said. “Yes. ” “Are we under lockdown again?” “Yes. ” He took this in. He didn’t seem particularly frightened. The fact that he didn’t, that this was his world now, saddened me almost as much as everything else.",-0.5
"The real problem with the ‘Hamilton’ shout-out to Pence.  came from a good place. But they also yet again revealed the peculiar failure of liberal America to practice the empathy it preaches. The actor who plays Aaron Burr in “Hamilton” thanked Vice   Mike Pence for coming to the show, then spoke up for “the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us . . . or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. ” The words were perfectly respectful  —   but the implication was downright rude. And blindly condescending. All the marches and media hysteria have made it quite plain how much alarm many feel over Donald Trump’s victory. More important: Pence had already sent a darn clear message by coming to see the show. He had just listened to the very voices Dixon (speaking for the cast) was asking him to hear. (Plus, facing scattered boos on the way into the theater, he’d also told his family, “That’s the sound of freedom. ”) ; we’d rather he’d let others comment. (Stevie Van Zandt’s tweet was on point: “There has never been a more outspoken politically active artist than me. He was their guest. You protect your guests. Don’t embarrass them. ”) But Pence took it all in stride,    —   “an incredible production and incredibly talented people. ” He “wasn’t offended,” he said, and most important: “I just want to reassure people that what   Donald Trump said on election night, he absolutely meant it from the bottom of his heart. He is preparing to be the president of all of the people of the United States of America. ” In Sunday’s Post,   that they might be “ignorant” about the lives of Trump voters  —   that they wrongly “swallowed, hook, line and sinker,” the “caricature of them the Democratic Party and the national liberal media created. ” Liberals dominate the national media (and most local media, too)  —   as well as Hollywood, Broadway and Silicon Valley. Red America has no choice but to listen to Blue America all the time. And, sorry, it’s Blue America that routinely screams “Shut up” to voices it doesn’t want to hear. That’s the essence of political correctness, and not just on campus: Recall, for example, the PC condemnation of the incredibly sensitive and nuanced “red” film “American Sniper. ” When you can’t understand how your fellow Americans could make “that man” our next president, maybe it’s time you stopped assuming it hasn’t heard you, and started listening yourselves.",1.0

"Japan's New Energy Rules Could Make It a Paradise for Renewables. Japan is a weird place. But not for any of the reasons you're thinking. I'm talking in terms of energy, because among industrialized, consumer-ized, electronically-driven nations, Japan probably has the world's worst portfolio of homegrown energy resources—it's the second largest net importer of fossil fuels. But it gets weirder. This month, the island nation rewrote its energy rules to give consumers the power to choose which energy source it wants. Before Fukushima, Japan got 30 percent of its power from nuclear energy. That would be significant even in a country with abundant natural resources. In lieu of coaxing a gas-filled meteor to fall into its lap, the Japanese government is hoping to use market forces to generate innovation in the energy sector. See, if electricity buyers get to buy from the lowest bidder, then those bidders will have to compete for ever-lower prices. Which doesn't just mean lower prices for consumers: It could result in a boom for renewables. ",0.0

"Why a prominent public health advocate prefers taxing soda to taxing all sugar.  Philadelphia’s mayor recently proposed a   tax on every ounce of sugary drinks (sodas, iced teas, and sports drinks are the major categories). If it passes, Philadelphia will be the first major American city to enact what’s often informally referred to as a ”soda tax,” though similar plans elsewhere have generally exempted diet sodas.    That would be a big deal  —   but is Philadelphia thinking big enough? Instead of just taxing soda, why not tax all sugar in the name of reducing obesity? We asked this question on this week’s episode of The Weeds  —   the podcast I   with Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias  —   and couldn’t come up with an answer. If Mountain Dew is falling under the heavy hammer of big government, after all, it seems fair that the likes of Twix and birthday cake should join it. Neither of them is exactly health food.    Would a sugar tax even work? Why don’t we hear about it? I called Barry Popkin, a leading expert on soda taxes at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill to find out.    Popkin told me that, theoretically, a sugar tax might work. He’s actually been talking to one country exploring that approach to regulation. But he sees good reasons  —   one logistical and one nutritional  —   to support a soda tax here in the United States, at least for the time being. First, the nutritional rational: Reducing soda consumption seems to be a better way to tackle obesity than reducing the consumption of sugar in foods. That’s because studies tend to find that reductions in beverage consumption don’t lead to increases in food consumption. We don’t feel the need to replace a coke, for example, with a donut or even a piece of fruit.    But restricting the consumption of sugar in food just doesn’t seem to be as powerful. ”We have a small effect on obesity when we limit sugar in food,” says Popkin. That might be because we just replace sugary foods with other,    calories. Then, there are the logistical challenges. If Mountain Dew is falling under the heavy hammer of big government, after all, it seems fair that the likes of Twix and birthday cake should join  If we taxed all sugar, then fruits  —   which have a natural sweetener, fructose  —   would fall under the fine. Public health advocates don’t want to tax apples and oranges. The thing that they probably want to tax is added sugar  —   sweetener that gets added in the process of creating food. Right now, food manufacturers aren’t required to differentiate between natural sugars (the kind in apples) and added sugars (the kind on top of Sour Patch Kids). And there are some products that have both (think of chocolate milk, which has a natural sugar  —   lactose  —   and added sugars from chocolate syrup). All of this would create the logistical nightmare of trying to sort out which items should and shouldn’t fall under a sugar tax.    ”Without the labeling it would be way too complex to set levels of natural sugar by product group,” Popkin says. Sodas make this task a bit easier. Nearly all sugar in sugary drinks is added; soda doesn’t have any natural sugar at all. The number of borderline cases that come up under a soda tax (the treatment of milk and juice, for example) will be much more manageable than those that arise with a   sugar tax. Some states have, however, tried to get more aggressive in regulating sugar. Seventeen states have a special tax they levy just on candy or snacks (the rationale for these fees actually began in the World War I era  —   not as a public health campaign, but as a way to raise war revenue by taxing consumption of a ”luxury good. ”) This approach ultimately runs into the same issue as a soda tax in that it misses a lot of the sugar in the world. A   ”snack tax” in California, for example, applied to Milky Way candy bars  —   but not Milky Way ice cream. If there is any hope for a sugar tax, though, it probably rests with the Food and Drug Administration. The agency will soon require nutritional labels to quantify how much ”added sugar” any food has. And that, Popkin says, could create a regulatory framework for a sugar tax. Your Twix bars, in other words, aren’t quite safe yet. ",-1.0
"The media doesn’t call the shots — Trump does. The media smart set fixates on creating a narrative that explains the big picture of events and offers gripping examples. In that spirit, then, here’s a narrative to help them understand President Trump’s recent burst of activity: He’s serving notice that he, and not the media, sets the nation’s agenda. And that when journalists behave like opponents, he will treat them like opponents, punching back harder than they punch him. That’s the meaning of the president’s epic press conference Thursday and his tour of the Boeing plant in South Carolina and Saturday’s rally in Florida. As Milton Friedman said in another context, everything else is detail. The catalyst for Trump’s   barnstorming was that, after a rough week in which Democrats in Congress picked up the loony left’s impeachment mantle, the president’s team looked outgunned and outmaneuvered. The emerging media narrative was that the White House was in chaos, riven by infighting, leaks, an unhappy president and an unhappier first lady. Trump knows better than most that perception, even if it’s wrong, can quickly harden into accepted fact. He sensed danger and decided to take matters into his own hands. Nobody speaks for Trump better than Trump, which is not always a virtue. But Thursday, he made a wise   decision to do his solo version of a reset. The official business was to announce his new nominee for secretary of labor, a choice that was   by the few outlets where it wasn’t ignored because of the media   that followed. (A good trivia question: name the new guy!) The president was deliberate in making his points, talking for more than 20 minutes about what he’s done to keep his campaign promises and how he’s unfairly depicted. His impressive litany of action includes canceling the   trade deal,   two pipeline projects and jawboning firms like General Motors and Walmart to spend and hire. He boasted of his 55 percent approval rating in a poll and of the booming stock market. He talked about rebuilding the military, hosting leaders from Japan, Israel, Canada and Great Britain, strengthening borders and immigrant vetting, targeting the Islamic State and nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch for the  Supreme Court, calling him a “true defender of our laws and our Constitution. ” Even as he complained about courts blocking his travel ban and Democrats delaying his Cabinet picks, Trump hailed “a tremendous surge of optimism” about the changes he’s making. That was Trump the agenda setter. Then came Trump the media basher. He contrasted public optimism with relentless press criticism, saying big outlets on both coasts don’t speak “for the people, but for the special interests and for those  profiting off a very, very  obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about [it] we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. ” He added: “We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. ” That was the start of a sustained media attack like nothing America has ever seen. If this were football, it would be described as   because the president plowed straight into the  establishment powers. He called much coverage “dishonest” and “fake news. ” He accused some of “hate” and “venom” and singled out individual reporters, anchors and outlets, especially CNN, saying it now peddles “very fake news. ” It was an extraordinary use of the bully pulpit, yet accounts calling it a nonstop rant don’t do it justice. Some of it was playful and teasing, and Trump wasn’t alone in finding humor on several occasions. Many journalists clearly enjoyed the raucous informality, which included    exchanges where some freely talked over the president. Contrast that with the previous eight years of news conferences, where President Barack Obama generally delivered long lectures to an amen chorus. There was contrast, too, in Trump spending 50 minutes taking more than 40 questions, all spontaneous and none arranged in advance. It was a scrum to be called on, and no topic was    —   he answered them all. He also made errors, repeated himself frequently and some answers raised more questions. But the overall performance was incredibly effective at creating a very different narrative about his tenure for the TV audience  —   the people he cares about most. Expect those two themes  —   he is putting America First and much of the media is dishonest  —   to be the pillars of his presidency, as they were the pillars of his campaign. That’s why he’s taking his show on the road, and likely will do so regularly. Predictably, his prime media targets reacted with feverish claims that Trump was “unhinged” and his  attacks were “ . ” Some said he is a threat to the First Amendment. On the contrary, he’s embracing it. As legendary New Yorker Ed Koch often said about his own criticisms of the press and judges, he didn’t lose his First Amendment rights when he became mayor. So it is with Trump. He’s free, like all Americans, to speak his mind. His words carry more weight as president, but attempts to silence him are truly  . The White House is not a coddled college safe space. Something else Koch said also is relevant. He once called a journalist who was a partisan critic a “politician with a press pass. ” That’s how Trump sees much of the media, and he’s more right than wrong. Many tried to block his election, and now are trying to destroy his presidency. They have a choice: get back to being journalists, or get used to being a piñata. Mayor de Blasio believes he’s fixed New York and is now concentrating on the rest of America. Heaven help the country. The mayor, the focus of federal and state criminal probes, wrote to 17 banks demanding they withdraw financing from the Dakota Access   project. His reasons read like a protester pamphlet, citing climate change, Indian tribal lands, groundwater, the banks’ balance sheets and rising sea levels. Naturally, he rails against “the greed of a few wealthy oil industry executives. ” The mayor also cites his duty to city pension funds, which are invested in some of the banks, implying the city might disinvest if the banks ignore him. It’s tempting to tell the mayor to focus on his day job. But his divided attention, while a loss for the nation, is a win for New York. He’s No. 1. New York Times columnist Tom Friedman takes the cake for writing “The Dumbest Thing Ever. ” A recent   rant included this absurdity: “Ladies and gentlemen, we were attacked on Dec. 7, 1941, we were attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, and we were attacked on Nov. 8, 2016. ” How sweet, a B.

Maybe you gave them your blessing when you first downloaded them, but did you know they are still there, lurking and listening?

Twitter also gives you control to discontinue a relationship with a third party—which is pretty great because typically once you click that you agree to how a website or app wants to access your data, the only way to discontinue the relationship is to uninstall and close your account.

"Which G20 country would prefer Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton? There’s only one..  If the US presidential election were held in Russia today, the next president would be   …     Donald Trump.    Those are the results of new survey research by YouGov. It found Russia is the only country in the G20, the international forum of 20 of the world’s major economies, that prefers Trump to Hillary Clinton:            At the same time, Mexico really doesn’t like Trump, preferring Clinton by a whopping 54 percentage points. The findings aren’t really surprising. Much of the Russian foreign policy establishment doesn’t like Clinton. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has praised Trump, and Trump has returned the favor. Trump is also, like Putin, widely perceived as an authoritarian strongman. All of this earns big points among Russians for Trump and against Clinton.    Mexico, on the other hand, has been the constant target of Trump’s campaign. Trump not only launched his campaign on accusations that Mexican immigrants are criminals and ”rapists,” but he also has threatened to block Mexican immigrants from sending remittances back to their home country, and he’s threatened to start a trade war with Mexico, among other countries. So in many ways, the data just reflects what one would expect of Trump’s comments in favor of an authoritarian regime and hateful remarks toward a big US trading partner.

"Polaroid Hits CES With a Super-Cheap, Super-Cute Camera. Nothing about the Polaroid Snap or Polaroid Snap+ will out-spec a competitor...except that whole printing thing. OK, but everything else about these tiny cameras is incredibly fine. There's no screen on the back, and all it does is snap a photo (in black and white, sepia, or color, which you can control from a small wheel mechanism on the top of the cam), and when you're done, it prints it. It uses Zink paper (no ink, just thermoprinting tech here). So it doesn't do a lot, but hey: It's only $99. Also, an amped-up version called the Snap+ will add a screen and connectivity, so you can connect it to your phone and use it as nothing more than a mobile photo printer. The Snap+ will be available later this year, but a little more—likely in the $140-150 range, and definitely below $200, Polaroid says. Basically, Polaroid's given us an adorable little toy. That's the company's new move. Make technologically worse versions of things other companies are making, sell them for near nothing, and hit up the market that wants (semi) digital fun at a fraction of the price. And really, Polaroid's intended audience isn't going to care that your digital camera has a way, way better sensor. Can it print stickers? Yeah. Exactly. ",0.0
"Some Amazon Workers Fear They’ll Earn Less Even With a $15 Minimum Wage. When Amazon announced Tuesday that it was raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all employees, even vocal critics of its labor practices like Senator Bernie Sanders praised the company. The retail giant’s decision will undoubtedly put more money into the hands of its workers—especially the some 100,000 temporary US employees Amazon plans to hire in the coming months for the holiday season. But some Amazon workers, including one who spoke with WIRED, think they will earn less under the new policy—even though they are receiving an hourly raise. The reason is that in addition to raising wages, Amazon is also slashing some performance bonuses and its restricted stock unit program. In total, workers say losing the benefits may amount to thousands of dollars in lost pay annually. The median salary for Amazon employees in the US, including stock and bonuses, is $34,123, according to the company.

"After a big loss in North Carolina, LGBTQ leaders explain what’s next.  The LGBTQ rights movement has seen major gains over the past several years, but the future of equality in America seems stuck at a crossroads.    On one hand, the Supreme Court upheld   couples’ right to marry nationwide. Transgender people and their issues are finally getting national attention with Caitlyn Jenner coming out and growing media attention from shows like Transparent and Orange Is the New Black. And the   Utah passed a nondiscrimination law protecting LGBTQ people in the workplace and housing.   Related How most states allow discrimination against LGBTQ people  On the other hand, there have been some bad losses for the LGBTQ movement. In November, Houston failed to keep its nondiscrimination law on the books after a campaign focused on transgender people in bathrooms. In March, North Carolina passed a sweeping law that prohibits nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people and bans trans people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity in schools and government buildings. Several states have considered similar   bathroom bills. More states have considered religious freedom bills in clear attempts to allow discrimination against LGBTQ people. So it’s a mixed story, even as the movement seems to be winning overall. For LGBTQ rights organizations, this messy environment poses the questions: What’s next? And how are LGBTQ groups going to win these next few fights in the US?    I reached out to six big LGBTQ organizations to answer these and other questions: the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) the Equality Federation, GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). These are by no means the only groups fighting for LGBTQ rights in America, but together they gave a good idea of what’s next in the battle for equality.    What big issues will the LGBTQ movement need to focus on in the next few years?      Rebecca Isaacs, executive director of the Equality Federation: ”In the 32 states right now that don’t have comprehensive nondiscrimination protections, there’s an ongoing need to move toward getting those protections. There’s three different approaches: local and state policy changes, federal protections, and litigation.” Chad Griffin, president of HRC: ”In a   world, when marriage equality has been brought to all 50 states in the country, the most outrageous situation has been created: Someone can get married at 10 am and on the same day [be] at risk of being fired from their job by noon and evicted from their home by 2, all because we have no explicit federal nondiscrimination protections. Our civil rights laws currently protect folks based on a whole host of categories, including race, religion, and national origin. But not gender identity and sexual orientation.”    James Esseks, director of LGBTQ issues at the ACLU: ”There are two big pushbacks coming from opponents of LGBT equality: One of them is religious exemption measures. Another is     bills that we’re seeing in state legislatures, and that’s part of what passed in North Carolina. But both religious exemption bills and these   bills come from the same place: At their core, they’re about authorizing discrimination against LGBT people.” What other LGBTQ issues also deserve more attention?            Kate Kendell, executive director of NCLR: ”There remains a whole range of work to be done specifically. But it’s all in service of one overarching goal:   …     for LGBT people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, to live with full dignity in civil society, free from stigma and discrimination based on who we are. ”Freedom from harassment on the streets. Transgender issues, particularly violence against transgender women of color. Rejection from families based on our sexual orientation or our gender identity. Access to health care. Care that takes into account of gender identity or sexual orientation in prison settings, jail settings, and youth homes.”    Mara Keisling, executive director of the NCTE: ”We’ve never as an LGBT movement or trans movement focused on economics. We’ve been very good with de jure discrimination. But we need a lot of help with de facto discrimination. We need to get people jobs.” ”We need to stop all the murders. That’s obviously just not about bigotry; it’s also about economics and what kind of people are targeted for violence. You’re more likely if you’re a   person, a person of color, a sex worker, an immigrant, or a trans person. And if you’re all of those things, you’re very susceptible to violence. ”We won’t have an effective or moral LGBT movement unless we understand that it has to be an   movement, an   movement, a disability rights movement, a   movement, a   movement, a   movement. Because that’s some of the discrimination people face first.” ”We’ve never as an LGBT movement or trans movement focused on economics” Chad Griffin, president of HRC: ”HIV and AIDS is also something that continues to be a top priority. It’s something that we’ve made a priority here. As medical science has progressed, public knowledge hasn’t necessarily kept up with that, nor has the knowledge within the medical community. We see, in terms of our work throughout the South, surveys that show a shocking and, quite frankly, devastating number of doctors, medical providers who are unaware of what they should be talking to their patients about  —   [patients] who either have HIV or are at risk of HIV.” Janson Wu, executive director of GLAD: ”The US is still locking up undocumented LGBTQ immigrants, particularly trans women, in detention facilities in which they face conditions that are fundamentally unsafe for them, where they face disproportionate violence and sexual assault  —   to the point that the UN has called the detention of these individuals the equivalent of torture.    ”There’s something going fundamentally wrong when 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ  —   in particular, youth of color. And that certainly deserves greater attention. ”We need to really continue to raise the standard higher and higher.   …     The example I like to use is around school climate: We’ve done an incredible amount of important work around bullying in schools.   …     But that should be the bare minimum. What if we worked for an   curriculum in history classes, so that all students  —   not just LGBTQ students  —   learn about the contributions that LGBTQ individuals have made throughout the history of the United States and the world?” How can the LGBTQ movement defeat the bathroom myth, the idea that some men take advantage of nondiscrimination laws for gender identity to pose as women in bathrooms and sexually harass or assault women?            Rebecca Isaacs, executive director of the Equality Federation: ”Humanizing [trans people] is a critical part of this piece.   …     When you meet people who are comfortable in their identity and live their identity, it just becomes clear that these fears are unwarranted.” Janson Wu, executive director of GLAD: ”Around the marriage issue, so many people had these false ideas of gay men as single sexual predators who were dangerous  —   really similar to the ways many people think of trans people. But once we were able to show that they are brothers, sisters, parents, children, and that they work in the community and volunteer in their churches and community groups, and put them in the context of their lives, it was really critical to advancing the equal humanity and dignity of all people, particularly LGBTQ people.” James Esseks, director of LGBTQ issues at the ACLU: ”The proponents of this [bathroom] bill in North Carolina couldn’t point to one situation where there has been the kind of sexual assault problem that they’re saying they need to stop. There are 19 states that have gender identity nondiscrimination provisions in their state laws. There are   cities that have gender identity nondiscrimination provisions in their city laws. With all of those people  —   millions of people  —   covered by those laws, there’s no stories of transgender people attacking people in the restroom. It doesn’t happen.” Chad Griffin, president of HRC: ”Whether you’re a Democratic governor or a Republican governor, virtually without exception, goal No. 1 is to keep jobs in your state and to attract new jobs that you don’t currently have. That is one thing that is shared between conservative governors, liberal governors, moderate governors.   …     So the increase in business [engagement and lobbying against these laws] has been key to our success, and I think it will be key to our success as we engage in these battles in the future.”    Why is it important for LGB people to stick together with trans people?            Rebecca Isaacs, executive director of the Equality Federation: ”If you think about traditional male and female presentation, the LGB movement was always a challenge to that  —   and it always had to do with gender nonconforming through butch women and effeminate men. So it was already about challenging to gender norms, even within just LGB.” Mara Keisling, executive director of the NCTE: ”There’s always been an understanding that we’re all just breaking the gender rules. Possibly the biggest rule of those is that you can’t have sex with someone of the same sex. But there’s a lot of parts to it about clothing, behavior, and how someone carries themselves in the world. We really are the same people in so many cultural, historic, and political ways.” Janson Wu, executive director of GLAD: ”When I was growing up and my parents worried that I was gay, my father would often criticize me for wearing my hair too long, for walking too effeminately, and for not playing sports. That was the way he understood what being gay meant. So from my own personal experience, it is impossible to separate the ways people view sexual orientation and gender identity and expression. That’s why it is critical for all of the letters to be successful.” James Esseks, director of LGBTQ issues at the ACLU: ”If we don’t get protection against gender identity discrimination and gender expression discrimination, there’s a whole lot of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people who won’t have the protection that we need. Because employers are going to come back and say, ’Oh, no, we didn’t fire her because she’s a lesbian. We don’t know what she does at home in her bedroom. We fired her because she’s too butch.’ So if gender expression and gender identity aren’t part of the protections, the protections don’t cover a lot of the community.” ",-1.0
"Maintaining fitness — not resting — may be key to recovering from an injury.  Given that Michael Wardian had multiple pelvic stress fractures and sports hernias, one would think that his rehab would have involved a lot of quality time on the couch. But it was just the opposite. Although Wardian, a professional runner, didn’t run for three months, he biked, hiked, walked and   his way back to health. “I wanted to maintain my fitness,” said Wardian, 41, of Arlington, a 2:17 marathoner and a veteran of 150 marathons and ultramarathons. “I asked detailed questions about what I could do instead of what I could not do. And I did those things at great length and with vigor. ” Wardian may be an elite, but his treatment regime  —   which involved staying as active as possible during rehab  —   is now routine for injured athletes of all levels of fitness. In the past, ailments such as stress fractures, IT band syndrome, plantar fasciitis and runner’s knee were typically treated with rest, ice and    painkillers. But this approach only compromised   fitness and deprived the injured of the emotional benefits of exercise when they needed it the most. What’s more, it kept runners, triathletes, and other athletes stuck in a cycle of chronic injury. “Now, we know that in the world of injuries, true rest isn’t really helpful,” said physical therapist Kerri Kramer Webb, founder of Fast Track Sports Medicine & Performance Center in Fairfax County. The standard approach these days is to keep ailing athletes as active as possible without aggravating their injuries, while finding and fixing whatever biomechanical and nutrition issues, training errors, muscle imbalances or weaknesses caused the injuries. “Before, people would get the RICE [rest, icing, compression and elevation] and then, not surprisingly, injuries tended to recur because they weren’t addressing the underlying issues,” said Adam Tenforde, a sports medicine doctor at the Spaulding National Running Center at Harvard University.   activities such as cycling, pool running, swimming and elliptical sessions circulate blood and healing nutrients to injured muscles and tendons, promoting cell growth and repair, Webb said. Exercise removes cellular debris that accumulates from damaged tissues and hastens the flow of synovial fluids, which lubricates the joints, she said. When they’re not being used regularly, muscles begin to lose their elasticity and bones get weaker, she added. What’s more, aerobic exercise helps release human growth factor hormones that promote healing in the tendons and connective tissues, said Stephen Pribut, a D. C. podiatrist. The mental and emotional boosts from regular workouts are just as essential to bouncing back. Exercise has been proven to provide protection against stress, help prevent and treat depression, and boost mood. Without a daily workout to take the edge off, levels of the stress hormone cortisol can remain chronically elevated, and that can lead to tissue breakdown and hinder the healing process, Webb said. Plus, it can lead to fatigue, depression, headaches, weight gain, colds and flu, and digestive problems. What’s more, the sudden   in physical activity can disrupt sleep, which is prime time for injured body tissues to recover, she added.  [You’ve heard sleep is crucial to your workout routine. Here’s why.]  “You’re already in pain and feeling terrible,” Webb said. “If you’re ordered to rest, you’re likely to feel even worse. The emotional piece takes a toll. Keeping patients moving keeps their mood up throughout the rehab process. ” What’s more, staying active keeps you from losing cardiovascular fitness you worked so hard to build, said Jordan Metzl, a New York doctor of sports medicine and author of “Running Strong. ” “Your cardiovascular system doesn’t know you have a knee injury,” Metzl said. “It’s much easier to lose fitness than to gain it. Deconditioning happens quickly. It’s much more challenging to get back into shape. ” Studies have shown that if you stop working out completely, cardiovascular fitness can significantly decline in just two weeks, said Ian Klein, an exercise physiologist at Ohio University. In general, for every one week of inactivity, it can take two weeks to regain lost cardiovascular fitness, he said. Muscle strength doesn’t fade as fast and is easier to regain, he said.  [How long does it take to get out of shape?]  When Wardian began running on the roads after four months of rigorous   he was surprised to see how quickly his fitness returned. Within two weeks, he finished a   in 1 hour 14 minutes  —   just eight minutes off his personal best. “I was beyond excited,” he said. Though it took him a few weeks to regain full speed, “I had a great base. ” Staying active while injured Here are some ways to stay active when you’re rehabbing an injury: ●First, do no harm. Talk with your doctor about which activities are safe, Pribut said. You want to get the benefits of aerobic exercise without aggravating your injury or creating a new one. Swimming and pool running, for instance, are typically safe with IT band syndrome, Achilles’ strains and stress fractures, as long as you’re not pushing off the pool wall with the injured area, he said. Stationary bikes are often safe with shin splints, plantar fasciitis and IT band syndrome, as long as you remain seated. But if you have Achilles’ issues, cycling can make the issues worse. ●Let pain be your guide. If any   activity hurts, stop right away. If you feel pain afterward, talk to your doctor before doing it again. Popping    painkillers is not wise, as it may allow you to aggravate your injury without knowing it, Webb warned. “Pain is a very important thing to feel,” she said. ●Find probable cause. Often injuries recur because rehab plans focus on vanquishing symptoms, not correcting the cause, Tenforde said. “Steroid injections, heat, ice and ultrasound might feel good at the time,” he said. “But they’re not going to translate to a   change. ” Work with a physical therapist to identify strength, flexibility, biomechanical or training issues that led to the injury, and devise a plan to correct them. See a sports dietitian to determine whether a nutrient deficiency played a role. ●Mimic your regular workouts. If you get the doctor’s greenlight, try to replicate the workouts you’d do in your regular routine. “Think of simulating what you’re trying to accomplish,” Tenforde said. You can do intervals of vigorous running in the pool or on the elliptical, which can also help you stay focused and break up the monotony, he said. ●Adjust your expectations. The more closely the activity replicates your regular routine, the easier it’s going to be to make a comeback once your injury has healed. For instance,   running has traditionally been the best way to maintain fitness and performance for distance runners, Klein said. But even that can’t elicit the exact same intensity as running, he added. Even so, you’ll retain more fitness and come back faster than if you did nothing. ●Eat well. Many athletes restrict calories in an effort to avoid weight gain during their layoff. That’s not wise, Pribut said, especially if a nutrient deficiency contributed to the injury. Although you may have to cut calories a little if you drastically cut your activity, if you’re maintaining a workout routine with   you shouldn’t have to worry about weight gain. Pribut recommended that those with stress fractures get extra calcium and vitamin D, plus plenty of   fatty acids, which have been linked to lower inflammation.

"3 Americans charged with trying to join ISIS. MIAMI  —   Authorities say three Florida men planned to travel to Syria and become fighters for the Islamic State. Federal prosecutors said in a news release Friday that    Gregory Hubbard,    Dayne Christian and    Darren Jackson of Palm Beach County are charged with conspiring to join the Islamic State. They were arrested Thursday. An FBI report says the three told an informant last year about plans to go to Syria, and spoke approvingly of terror attacks in Orlando, San Bernardino, California, and elsewhere. It also says they talked about attacking the White House or Pentagon but took no specific steps. The three are being held pending arraignment.

"Death squads in the Philippines.  RODRIGO DUTERTE, the new president of the Philippines, is overseeing exactly what he pledged in his campaign: a terrifying surge of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers, users and criminals. From the day after he was elected, May 10, to Aug. 4, by a local account, there had been 571 killings, most of them simple executions by police and vigilante groups. Mr. Duterte promised to “shoot to kill” and eliminate drug dealing in the country in six months. In fact, he is killing the rule of law, and that could undermine Philippine democracy. Mr. Duterte declared in his inaugural speech that his “adherence to due process and the rule of law is uncompromising. ” But later that day, after taking the oath, Mr. Duterte visited a Manila slum and told a crowd, referring to drug dealers, “These sons of whores are destroying our children. I warn you, don’t go into that, even if you’re a policeman, because I will really kill you. If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself, as getting their parents to do it would be too painful. ”  The Philippines has a serious drug problem, chiefly with crystal meth, a. k. a. shabu. The drug trade took root in a nation plagued by rampant corruption and a discredited political establishment. Mr. Duterte’s firebrand response to drugs has been popular. But the street executions are taking lives without trials or proof of criminality. Drug addicts and abusers who need medical attention and counseling are getting a bullet instead. Police have claimed suspects resisted arrest or shot at them but have provided no evidence. More than 300 organizations involved in issues related to drug production, trafficking and use have appealed to international   agencies to help stop the killings and to tell Mr. Duterte that they “do not constitute acceptable drug control measures. ” That’s putting it mildly.  No one should be surprised by Mr. Duterte’s brutal tactics. He has been championing extrajudicial violence for nearly two decades. From 1998 until this year he served as mayor of Davao City on the main southern island of Mindanao, where death squads took the lives of more than 1, 000 people. An investigation in 2009 by Human Rights Watch documented the grisly methods of the killers; they meted out summary executions with impunity. On May 24, 2015, in a television broadcast, Mr. Duterte identified with the shadowy killers. “Am I the death squad? True. That is true,” he said. He pledged that if elected president, he would execute100, 000 criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay.  The past few weeks provide grim foreshadowing that he may be serious about that. Mr. Duterte won the election as a profane,    leader who did not bristle at the word “dictator. ” While the persona may have proved effective in the campaign, a real dictator, especially one with blood on his hands, is hardly what the Philippines needs.

"Pinterest's Evan Sharp Trusts Design to Keep Things Simple. Jonathan Ive, Chief design officer at Apple Evan Sharp, Cofounder and head of design, product, and marketing at Pinterest As Apple’s head of design, Jony Ive is responsible for everything from the curves at the edge of the iPhone’s screen to the haptic bup of an Apple Watch notification. When asked to name a person who will make a measurable impact on our future, Ive points to Evan Sharp of Pinterest. “He understands that complex problems can be simplified and often resolved visually,” Ive says. “Nuance and subtlety characterize his work. He doesn’t just address a functional imperative.” October 2018. Subscribe to WIRED. WIRED: Jony says he likes your work on Pinterest, that the design brings a sense of order to a chaotic bunch of images and text. Evan Sharp: The layout of Pinterest is designed to give you control over browsing. If you think about browsing as a concept, animals browse for food in the jungle. They literally look for leaves and pick out the good ones. It’s this very genetic, very deep impulse that we have to browse. Pinterest is just a digital manifestation of that behavior. A lot of the beauty of Pinterest isn’t the way it looks. It looks fine, but it’s really the impact it has, the way it gives people a sense of clarity about what their dreams might look like. It gives them a sense of control over what their future could be. WIRED: So you’re saying that by giving people agency over this domain they’ve created, you can make them feel good? Sharp: That’s what I hear from users. It’s hopefully a positive place where they feel creatively inspired. I think people grossly underestimate how much the way an environment is designed can affect the way they behave and feel. We have an ethical responsibility to create environments that let people feel empowered, inspired, and encouraged rather than these behavior-­modification empires that are being built. WIRED: That must be an interesting part of the job—balancing the urge to get people to spend more time in the app with the desire to build something that serves its purpose and then gets out of the way. Sharp: Pinterest isn’t just an entertainment app. We’re not trying to get you to spend five more hours a day on it. We decided not to be in the rat race of just “time spent.” I guess “time invested” would be a phrase that makes more sense to me. How do we make this a place where you want to invest your time because you get a return that is greater than what you contributed, rather than spend the time that you’ve saved up? I just made that up, but I like it. WIRED: What are some other key elements that go into making a design work? Sharp: As a user, you shouldn’t have to think about what the different concepts are. “That’s my feed, and those are my messages, and that’s my profile.” It just gets in the way. A great tool is intuitive; you just hammer the nail. In architecture, there are all these “form and function” sayings—you know, “form follows function.” With something like an app, form needs to communicate function for it to be really simple. Then there’s another F that we don’t talk enough about, and that’s “fit.” The app should fit into your life in a way that’s meaningful and healthy and beneficial. WIRED: Personalization, recommendations—those things help with fit. Sharp: One of the biggest revelations for me has been working closely with machine-learning teams. The Pinterest home feed for me is this unbelievably magical, intuitive surface where it shows me things I could never consciously articulate but that are very related to my taste, very related to what’s happening in my life. It doesn’t always get it right, but it gets better and better every six months. Then you see something you like, and you go in this rabbit hole of exploration. Industrial design is like architecture: You have to have knowledge of materials, materiality, and production. You go study samurai swords. That’s how you master your craft. And I think in software right now there’s an equivalent with machine learning. The quality of software is much more about machine learning now than it is about anything else. There’s also the user experience—I’m not trying to say that’s not important. It’s vital. But no one does it well. All software is shit, including Pinterest. I’m just being very candid. It will be much better in 20 years. This article appears in the October issue. Subscribe now.

"Beware simple solutions in a complex world.  It’s the annual gathering of world leaders in New York this week, and for most of them, it’s time for group therapy. Around the globe, leaders of all stripes seem afflicted with the same malady: low approval ratings. Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma has pointed out that the median approval rating for the leaders of the top 20 emerging and developing economies has dropped by 17 points over the past decade. What is going on? Sharma argues that the cause is economic. Global growth has slowed from a   War II average of 3. 5 percent to 2 percent since 2008. There is no region of the world that is growing faster today than it was before the global financial crisis. And yet, the very rich continue to prosper. Sharma notes that the number of billionaires globally has doubled, to more than 1, 800. Seventy of them live in one city, London.  But, in fact, the problem is deeper than simply a slowdown. There is a wider sense of political paralysis, which leads to public frustration. The underlying causes for this anger are even more fundamental in many Western countries. Growth in the West has been falling since the 1970s, including in the United States. Productivity growth has never returned to postwar levels, except for a brief period in the 1990s. As I argue in a forthcoming Foreign Affairs essay, Western countries face four structural challenges  —   demography, globalization, automation and increasing debt burdens. The demographic challenge might be the most fundamental. In almost every advanced economy, fertility has dropped sharply, from Japan to South Korea, Germany to Italy. The number of centenarians in Japan is more than twice what it was a decade ago, with 32, 000 people in the country expected to turn 100 just this year.  Globalization and the information revolution boost growth overall, but they concentrate the costs on skilled and semiskilled workers, particularly in basic manufacturing industries that once provided large numbers of stable,   jobs.  As a response to the global financial crisis, governments have taken on huge debts. In addition, the aging population means that spending on the elderly is crowding out the investment needed for growth  —   in infrastructure, education, science and technology. Facing these forces, leaders have no easy path to restore growth and revive their countries. Deep, radical reforms are unpopular and in this climate do not seem to lead to roaring growth. Ireland, Portugal and Mexico have all enacted broad market reforms, and yet, growth has not come booming back. Japan has spent hundreds of billions on stimulus plans and yet it is just muddling along. Thus, even the leaders who come to office with strong public approval and much promise find themselves trapped by the same forces. Very quickly their approval ratings begin to drop and new populist anger grows. Italy’s reformist prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has seen his numbers fall below 30 percent. The populist Greek leader, Alexis Tsipras, is down to 19 percent.  President Obama outlined many solutions to the problems of growth and inequality in his speech Tuesday to the United Nations. He explained how the United States has focused its reform and recovery efforts on helping the middle class gain better access to jobs, health care, training and housing. He argued that furthering these efforts  —   with new investments in child care, infrastructure and basic research  —   would keep this momentum going. He pointed out that immigration and assimilation can work for all of society.  But the policy solutions he put forth and the ones that other countries are adopting are all   specific and incremental. They are wonky efforts to nudge the market, government and people in ways that will work gradually. Meanwhile, the populists promise dramatic, bold solutions that sound much more satisfying. Donald Trump tells Americans that their lives are hard and there is a simple reason for it: foreigners. They steal American jobs, burden the United States’ welfare state and make Americans less safe. His solution is to get tough on them. That will make the country great again, he promises. It’s not hard to understand the appeal of simplicity in a complex world. There is little drama in plans to expand   education  —   and yet they work. The persistent and energetic efforts at reform do pay off. Sensible,     government policy makes a difference. A recent Census Bureau report, showing the biggest   drop in poverty in the United States in almost 50 years, highlights that these efforts are working. To the United States’ north, Canada is handling a slowdown in growth, welcoming thousands of refugees and celebrating diversity. And the two major leaders in the Western world with the highest approval ratings today are Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau. The center can hold.

"Sean Spicer’s angry, lonely defense of Trump’s wiretapping claim, annotated.          Things got very contentious in the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon, as press secretary Sean Spicer was confronted with the bipartisan doubts of congressional leaders about Trump’s claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped him. At one point, Spicer spent several minutes reading through a list of reports that he felt bolstered Trump’s claim. Journalists, meanwhile, pushed back on the evidence Spicer provided, none of which addressed Trump’s central claim that Obama was behind the alleged surveillance of Trump Tower, and some of which came from dubious   ideologically tinged sources such as Sean Hannity. Below is the transcript, with our annotations. To see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. We’ll pick things up right after Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney appeared to talk over the budget.  SPICER: Jonathan Karl? QUESTION: So, Sean, the day before yesterday, you said you were extremely confident that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees would ultimately vindicate the president’s allegation that Trump Tower was wiretapped. As I’m sure you have now seen, the Senate Intelligence Committee has said they see no indications Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance. That seems to be a pretty blanket statement. What’s your reaction? SPICER: Well, I think there are several things, I would also    it’s    its interesting to me that you know, just as a    as a point of interest that when    when one entity says one thing that    that proves, that claims one thing, you guys cover it ad nauseam. When Devin Nunes came out and said, ’I think it’s very possible,’ yesterday, there was crickets from you guys. When Devin Nunes came out and said there was no connection that he saw to Russia, crickets. When Tom Cotton said the same, you don’t wanna cover this stuff    no, no, hold on. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..on no evidence. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, actually. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..now you’ve had the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no, actually here’s his quote, Jonathan, no here’s the direct quote, ”I think it’s very possible,” end quote. That’s what he said when he said the president’s communications could’ve been swept up in collection. So again, I. .. QUESTION: He said there was no    I saw no indication of a wire tap. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: I understand that, and I think    and I think the president’s been very clear when talks about this, and he talked about it last night. So we talked about wire tapping, he meant surveillance and that there have been incidents that have occurred. Devin Nunes couldn’t have stated it more beautifully. But you choose not to cover that part. You chose not to cover when Tom Cotton went out, when Richard Burr went out, when others, Chairman Nunes and others and said that there was no    hold on. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..Intelligence Committee take. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Yeah I    no, I understand that, Jonathan. And where was your passion and where was your concern when they all said that there was no    no connection to Russia? Where was it then? You    crickets, from you guys, because at the end of the day, when    no, no, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, I’m    hold on, hold on. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..tower? SPICER: I’m making a point. The point is this, number one, that it’s interesting how when evidence comes out and people who have been briefed on the Russia connection come out and say that there was nothing that they have seen that proves a connection, you choose not to cover that, you don’t stop the narrative. You continue to perpetuate a false narrative. When he came out yesterday and said quote, ”I see no evidence that this happened.” When he said quote, ”I think it’s very possible,” like I said, we should know    you don’t cover that part. You only cover the part    but let’s go through what we do know, OK? Hold on, hold on, let me    and I’m trying to answer your question, Jonathan, if you can calm down. If you look at [inaudible] on January 20    12th, 2017, they said quote, ”In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government’s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. The new rules significantly relax   limits on what the NSA may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operation, which are largely unregulated by wire tapping laws.” When Sarah Carter reported that by the start of the New Year, brought with it unexpected politicizing of the intelligence gathered in secret. Separately, the Obama administration amended a   executive order, allowing information intercepted through FISA warrants or by the National Security Agency to be shared by a wider audience and 16 government agencies as Obama was leaving offices. Intelligence normally reserved for just a handful of intelligence leaders was spread throughout briefings, of    to scores of workers and soon, leaks began appearing in news media organizations, often in stories lacking context of how national security investigations are actually concluded. On March 3rd, Fox News chief anchor Bret Baier said the following, quote, ”There was a report in June 2016, a FISA request by the Obama administration forwarding intelligence surveillance court to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several other campaign officials. Then they got turned down, then in October, then they renewed it into a start up wire tap at Trump Tower with some computer and Russian banks.” Baier continues, ”A June FISA request that foreign intelligence surveillance courts get shot down. A judge says,”    hold, Jonathan, I’m gonna    you can ask, you can  . ”A judge says no go to monitoring Trump Tower, they go back in October, they do get a FISA granted. This is wire tap going on in a monitoring of computers that has some ties they believe to Russian counts. By all accounts, they don’t come up with anything in the investigation, but the investigation continues and we don’t know it.” On November 11th, 2016, days after the election, Heat Street reported, quote, ”Two separate sources with links to the counter intelligence community had confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI saw and was granted a FISA warrant in October, giving counter surveillance intelligence permission to examine the activities of U. S. persons and Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia. ”The first requests, which sources say named Trump, was denied back in June. But the second was drawn more narrowly and granted in October after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the Trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks, SVB Bank and Russia’s Alfa Bank. ”Sources suggest, that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full context of related documents that concern U. S. person. Two separate sources with links to the counter intelligence community have confirmed that the FBI saw it and was granted a FISA warrant in October, giving counter intelligence permission to examine the activity of U. S. persons and Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.” They go on: ”The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activities, between the server and two banks. However, it is thought that the intelligence community that the warrant covers any U. S. person connected to this U. N. investigation. And thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men, who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as immediate surrogates.” On January 19th, the New York Times reported the following, ”American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communication and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible leaks between Russian officials and associates of   Donald J. Trump. One official said, ”Intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications have been provided to the White House. It is unclear what Russian official is under investigation or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigation is low.” Andy McCarthy, writing in National Review suggested quote, ”From three reports from The Guardian, Heat Street and the New York Times, it appears the FBI has concerns about a private server in Trump Tower that was connected to one or two Russian banks.” Heat Street describes these concerns as centering on quote ”possible financial    and banking offenses.” I    this is his quote    ”I italicized the word offenses because it denotes crimes. Ordinarily when crimes are suspected, there is a criminal investigation, not a national security investigation.” We go on. Sara Carter from the Circa reporting, ”Intelligence professionals tell Circa News they were concerned that some of the Russian intelligence was spread through group briefings to a much larger than usual audience back in January. This would have happened during the final days of the Obama Administration, when it expanded Executive Order 12333, which allows and plays with a quote ’need to know’ and further unfettered access to broad data stowed by the NSA. ”The new rules allow the NSA to share    quote    ’raw signals intelligence information, including the names of those involved in phone conversations and  . The expansion of the order makes it difficult to narrow on the leaks and, frankly, it allows too many people access to the raw data, which only used to be available to a select few,’ said a U. S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not granted to be speak on the authority.” Numerous outlets including the New York Times have reported on the FBI investigation into Mr. Trump’s advisers, BBC and Lynn McCarthy revealed the existence of a   working group to coordinate investigations across the thing. On February 14th, the New York Times again refers to phone records and intercepted calls    let me quote them, ”American law enforcement intelligence agency intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering the evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three officials said.” ”The intelligence” Russia    ”the intelligence agencies then thought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on hacking or on other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that so far, they’ve seen no evidence of such cooperation.” ”The official said that the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials and other associates of Mr. Trump.” ”The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the FBI is sifting through.” Days later, the New York Times then reports, quote ”In the Obama administration’s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election of Donald Trump, connections between the   and Russians across the government.” But the increasingly hard to escape conclusion that in our government that    individuals in our government were instead trying to undermine the new president by saying quote    this is the New York Times again    ”At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence into possible analysis to keep the report at relatively low classification levels, to ensure a widespread leadership across the government.” And in some cases    quote    ”among them European allies. This allowed the upload of as much information    intelligence that was possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by American analysis to share information.” Sean Hannity went on Fox to say, quote, ”But protections which are known as minimization procedures have been put in place to protect Americans that are not under warrant,” American citizens that are caught up in the surveillance. And quote, ”By the way, their identities are protected. Their constitutional rights    are to be protected. Now of course, this was not the case with Lieutenant General Flynn, because we know a transcript of this call was created and then given to intelligence officials, who then leaked this information, which is a felony, to the press that printed it,” end quote. Last on Fox News, on March 14th, Judge Andrew Napolitano made the following statement, quote, ”Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA, he didn’t use the CIA, he didn’t use the FBI and he didn’t use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What is that? It’s the initials for the British intelligence finding agency. So, simply by having two people saying to them president needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump’s conversations, involving   Trump, he’s able to get it and there’s no American fingerprints on this. Putting the published accounts and   together, this leads to a lot.” QUESTION: So Sean, are you saying. .. SPICER: So, John. .. QUESTION: . ..that despite the findings, the bipartisan findings of the Senate Intelligence Committee    SPICER: No, they’re not findings. They’re two    there’s a statement out today. They have not begun this. As you know, yesterday or two days ago, the Department of Justice asked for an additional week. So they    the statement clearly says that at this time, that they don’t believe that. They have yet to go through the information. The Department of Justice, as you know, has not supplied this. But I just read off to you    it’s interesting. When the New York Times reports. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Hold on, hold on. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. that whole long answer. .. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate it. QUESTION: OK. So, are you saying that the president still stands by his allegation that President Obama ordered wiretapping or surveillance of Trump Tower despite the fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee says they see no indication that it happened? SPICER: But. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Does the president still stand by the allegation? SPICER: First of all, he stands by it, but again, you’re mischaracterizing what happened today. The Senate. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: I understand that. And at the same time, they acknowledge that they have not been in contact with the Department of Justice. So    but again, I go back to what I said at the beginning. It’s interesting. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Hold on, hold on. It’s interesting how at the same time, where were you coming to the defense of that same Intelligence Committee and those members when they said there was no connection to Russia? You didn’t seem to report it then. There was no    no, no. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: . .. so you want    you want a comment and you want to perpetuate a false narrative when. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. report that Clapper said that. I. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: But when those individuals have gone out time and time again; when Chairman Nunes has said, number one, that there was no information that he’s aware of that that existed, that got zero reporting. Number two, when he went out yesterday and said, quote, ”I think it’s very possible,” you don’t include that in the question mark. The bottom line is that the president said last night that he would be providing    that there would be additional information coming forward. He’s    there’s a ton of media reports out there that indicate that something was going on during the 2016 election. And I think it’s interesting, where was the questioning of the New York Times or these other outlets when that was going on? Where was the questioning. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: I believe he will. Jim? QUESTION: Yeah, you were just quoting Sean Hannity there. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are quoting. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: I also quote    I get you’re going to cherry pick. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. the FBI director. You’re citing Sean Hannity. .. SPICER: No, no, no. OK. You also look over    you also tend to overlook all of the other sources, because I know you want to cherry pick it. But    no, no. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: . .. but    but you do. But where was your concern about the New York Times report? You didn’t seem to have a concern with that. QUESTION: We have done    I’ve done plenty of reporting on all of this. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no, but you want to cherry pick one. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. these connections between the. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: . .. one commentary    one piece of commentary. QUESTION: . .. associates of the president to the Russians. That has all been looked at and. .. SPICER: No, but how do you know all this? The    the    how do you seem to be such an expert on this? QUESTION: I’m saying that this has been looked at, Sean. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: How do you know it’s been looked at? (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Hold on, hold on. Where is    I’m sorry    I’m afraid    to understand    where    can you tell me how you know that all of this has, quote, ”been looked at”? QUESTION: You’re asking me whether or not. .. SPICER: You made a statement. You said, quote, ”all of this has been looked at.” QUESTION: . .. other outlets have reported. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no. So, OK, so we’re    so when your outlet says it’s all been looked at. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. to the president and the Russians during the 2016 campaign. It sounds like during the context of that investigation, there might have been some intercepted communications. The House Intelligence Committee chairman did mention that. And we have reported that. Others have reported that    (inaudible) and various publications. But Sean, what you are refusing to answer    the question that you are refusing to answer is whether or not the president still believes what he believes. .. SPICER: No, I’m not. I just said it to Jonathan. I didn’t refuse to answer that. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. you have a Senate and House Intelligence Committee both leaders from both parties on both of those panels saying that they don’t see any evidence of any wiretapping. So how can the president go on and continue to. .. SPICER: Because that’s not    because you’re mischaraterizing what Chairman Nunes said. He said, quote, ”I think it’s possible”    he is following up on this. So to suggest that. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: And you’re stating unequivocally that you somehow. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. literally, you said if you. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Right. And I think that we’ve already cleared that up. And he said exactly that. But the president has already said clearly, when he referred to wiretapping, he was referring to surveillance. So that’s. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: So that’s. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. sounds like, though, Sean, that you and the president are saying now, ”Well, we don’t need wiretapping anymore; that’s not true anymore. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: So now we’re going to [inaudible] other forms of surveillance. What’s it going to be next? SPICER: No, no, that’s not    Jim, I think that’s cute, but at the end of the day, we’re talked about this for three or four days. What the president had to, quote, ”wiretapping,” in quotes, he was referring to broad surveillance. And now you’re basically going back. We talked about this several days ago. The bottom line is that the investigation by the House and the Senate has not been provided all of the information. And when it does    but where was the concern. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: . .. hold on. I just. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. not evidence. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no. What I    I think the president addressed that last night, said there’s more to come. These are merely pointing out that I think there’s widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election, there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people. That came up. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. investigation going on as to whether there was contact between the president’s campaign and the Russians. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Jim, I find it interesting that you    you somehow believe that you. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. of course, they’re going to be looking at these various. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: OK. OK. I get it. Somehow, you seem to believe that you have all of this information. You’ve been read in on all of these things, which I find very interesting. QUESTION: I haven’t [inaudible] by the FBI. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Well, no, you’re coming to some serious conclusions for a guy that has zero intelligence. .. (CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Well, give me some credit. .. SPICER: I’ll give you some. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. a little intelligence maybe. But no. .. SPICER: Clearance. I wasn’t done. Clearance. QUESTION: . ..those two    those two panels. .. SPICER: Maybe both. QUESTION: Well, come on. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Those two panels have spoken with the FBI director and I was. .. SPICER: I    I understand that. .. QUESTION: . ..told there’s no evidence of this. SPICER: OK I    I think this question’s has been asked and answered. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. just have the president say he was wrong. SPICER: It’s interesting how you jump to all of these conclusions about what they have, what they don’t have and you seem to know all the answers. But at the end of the day, there was clearly a ton of reporting. .. QUESTION: A week from now. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: Hold on, Jim, let me answer    no, I    I think that there’s been a    a vast amount of reporting which I just detailed, about activity that was going on in the 2016 election. There was no question that there was surveillance techniques used throughout this. I think by    by a variety of outlets that have reported this activity concluded. So and I think when you actually ask those two people whether or not and as Chairman Nunes said yesterday, when you take it literally in   the president’s already been very clear that he didn’t mean specifically wire tapping, he had it in quotes. So I think to fall back on that is a false    is a false premise, that’s not what he said. He was very clear about that when he talked about it yesterday, major. QUESTION: Sean? QUESTION: OK Sean, so just to be clear, you’re good and the president’s good with stories that have anonymous sources in them? SPICER: No, it’s interesting, I think when it comes to the Russia story and the    sources who have been briefed by the FBI continue to conclude that there’s nothing there. You guys continue to fall back on these anonymous sources and perpetuate a false narrative. And yet, when it comes to us talking about all these reports in there, you then criticize anonymous sources. No, it’s just interesting, this    this sort of    the double standard that exists when it comes to us citing stories when it comes to    and then how you intend to use them. QUESTION: So let me ask you what    what the president said last night. He was asked by Tucker Carlson, you’re in charge of the various intelligence apparatus that report to you. .. SPICER: Right. QUESTION: . ..you can ask them. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: You can, he would be getting. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..can I ask my question? SPICER: Yeah. QUESTION: He said he was reluctant to do that. SPICER: Right. QUESTION: So lemme just put two things together. Earlier this week, you told us when asked, has the president directed the Justice Department to collect and distribute information to the various relevant congressional committees? If I remember your answer correctly, it was. .. SPICER: That’s right. QUESTION: . ..no we hadn’t given that specific directions. Has that changed, has he now directed the Justice Department. .. SPICER: No. QUESTION: . ..and is he asking himself, or the intelligence agencies that report to him, to provide him specific answers to these underlying questions that are separate from the reportages. .. SPICER: No. QUESTION: . ..you’re citing? SPICER: No. QUESTION: Why not? SPICER: Because I think we’ve covered this before, I think that gets into interfering this and I think that the appropriate process is to allow the House and the Senate to do it so that it doesn’t appear as though we’re interfering    I understand that. But as I’ve    I mentioned to you this the other day, Major, if we go at them then you’re gonna turn around and say you guys interfered with something and you pressured them. It’s a   for us, and the bottom line is, is that I think the president made a clear two Sundays ago that he wanted the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee to work with these agencies to collect the information and make a report. That’s what we’re doing. In    in order to make sure that there’s a separation from us, so that you can’t turn around and then accuse us of    of forcing or pressuring an agency to produce a document. We’re asking them to go through the process of    of this separation of powers and actually going to those different entities, the Department of Justice said yesterday they want an additional week. And we’re allowing that process to play through. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Sean? SPICER: Got it, Abby? QUESTION: Sean? QUESTION: Sean, I got a  . .. QUESTION: Did the president make any statements based on classified information? SPICER: I’m not gonna get into what the    how the president makes a decision. I think that what I think is clear though, is through the reporting that I just read is if there’s clearly widespread   material pointing to surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..information is available to members of the House and the Senate is public, as you noted. They are looking at [inaudible] information. .. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, no, no, they have    no, no, that’s not true. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..evidence to back up the president’s claims. So if there is other information, why won’t the president release. .. SPICER: Again, I’m not gonna get into that yet. I think the president discussed that last night on    on his interview and we’ll let the process play out. I understand what he discussed, I think they have    they have    they have clearances in the House and the Senate intelligence committees. They’re able to conduct this. Alexis? QUESTION: Sean, I’d like to ask you about two topics, but can you help us all by calling on Peter right now? (LAUGHTER) SPICER: No I’m gonna    I understand    I actually call the question. Alexis, if you don’t an answer to your question, I can call on somebody else. (CROSSTALK) SPICER: No, thank you. Gabby? QUESTION: Thanks, Sean. In the case that Judge Watson issued against    the restraining order against Trump’s second travel    or the president’s second travel ban, he included one of the president’s tweets. And this is also included in the Washington State case. So I’m wondering, does it give the president any pause that this virtual paper trail is creating    is having an impact on advancing his agenda? ***MORE TRANSCRIPT TO COME***",-0.5
"Surgeon General Vivek Murthy was just dismissed from his post as top doctor.  Vivek Murthy, America’s “top doctor” and an Obama appointee, was dismissed and replaced by the Trump administration on Friday.    In a statement, the administration said it asked Murthy to resign from his post as surgeon general after he helped with “a smooth transition. ”    Thank you America for the privilege of a lifetime. I have been humbled and honored to serve as your #SurgeonGeneral. https:  .  —   Vivek Murthy (@vivek_murthy) April 22, 2017    ”Dr. Murthy has been relieved of his duties as Surgeon General and will continue to serve as a member of the Commissioned Corps,” a White House statement read, adding that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price ”thanks him for his dedicated service to the nation. ”  The New York Times reported a somewhat different story: Murthy was asked to step down, refused, and was fired.     He’ll be replaced by Rear Adm. Sylvia   a nurse who currently serves as deputy surgeon general. (In an acting role for now, she will be the first   to take the post of America’s “top doctor. ”)    Murthy’s early departure came as a surprise to the public health community. It’s unusual  —   but not unprecedented  —   for a surgeon general’s   term to be cut short. Murthy’s term should have run until the end of next year.  The surgeon general’s office is in charge of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, a team of 6, 700 public health workers stationed across the US. Although he or she has little power to change policy, surgeons general have a history of creating unwanted controversy for the political leadership, and raising awareness about sometimes inconvenient or uncomfortable facts about public health.    Murthy, a graduate of Harvard and Yale University schools of medicine and business, holds views on gun control that are at odds with those of the new administration. When President Obama nominated Murthy back in November 2013, the Senate blocked his nomination for more than a year, particularly after the National Rifle Association criticized a letter Murthy had   in support of gun control measures.  Murthy only got confirmed in December 2014 after some   Democrats who were losing their seats anyway decided to switch course and back him. Murthy was also a strong supporter of Obamacare. He   Doctors for America in May 2009  —   around the time the fight about the Affordable Care Act was heating up. “The country’s main doctor trade group, the American Medical Association, remained neutral on the Affordable Care Act. In founding Doctors for America, Murthy says he saw an opportunity to organize the doctors who very much did support Obamacare,” Sarah Kliff reported.     Most recently, Murthy’s office came out with a report that included clear,   suggestions about what steps need to be taken to combat the opioid epidemic  —   but Murthy wasn’t tapped to join President Trump’s recently announced opioid commission.  For now, Murthy isn’t commenting on the details of his departure. In a statement on Facebook, he shared some of the lessons he learned on the job  —   reflecting the daily yogi’s usual outspoken concerns about   and kindness:   1. Kindness is more than a virtue. It is a source of strength. If we teach our children to be kind and remind each other of the same, we can live from a place of strength, not fear. I have seen this strength manifest every day in the words and actions of people all across our great nation. It is what gives me hope that we can heal during challenging times. 2. We will only be successful in addressing addiction  —   and other illnesses  —   when we recognize the humanity within each of us. People are more than their disease. All of us are more than our worst mistakes. We must ensure our nation always reflects a fundamental value: every life matters. 3. Healing happens when we are able to truly talk to and connect with each other. That means listening and understanding. It means assuming good, not the worst. It means pausing before we judge. Building a more connected America will require us to find new ways to talk to each other. 4. The world is locked in a struggle between love and fear. Choose love. Always. It is the world’s oldest medicine. It is what we need to build a nation that is safe and strong for us and our children.   ",-1.0
"Justice Kennedy isn’t retiring just yet. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy isn’t resting his case just yet. The high court broke for its summer recess Monday without an  from the    judge. He could still make the call at anytime, but the last day was seen as the most likely time. Kennedy hasn’t actually said anything publicly to suggest he’s hanging up his gavel anytime soon, but speculation has been swirling for months, fueled by his colleagues and lawmakers.

"The best new Senate race gaffe is about whether Donald Trump is a good role model for children.  Here’s your latest reminder about how deeply strange this election year is.     1) On Monday night, a sitting Republican senator in a swing state said that her party’s presidential nominee would be a good role model for children.  2) This statement, which would be banal in any ordinary race, was immediately interpreted as a crippling gaffe that would imperil the senator’s reelection. 3) So the senator soon issued a statement saying she “misspoke” and clarifying that the party’s nominee is not, in fact, a good role model.     4) However, she’s still voting for him to become president.    Yes, this is how Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire began her week. Locked in a tight reelection race against her state’s Democratic governor, Maggie Hassan, Ayotte was asked during a debate whether she would tell children “to be like Donald Trump. ” The moderator continued: “Would you point to him as a role model?” “Uh, I, uh, I think that certainly there are many role models that we have. And, uh, I believe he can serve as president. And so absolutely. I would do that,” Ayotte stammered in response.      Yikes, absolutely painful response from Kelly Ayotte on whether children should look up to Donald Trump as a role model. pic. twitter.  —   Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) October 3, 2016    Recognizing this admission for the disaster it was, Ayotte’s campaign soon sent out a statement that read as follows: “I misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn’t hold up either of them as role models for my kids. ” Now, oddly enough, Ayotte has said for months that she will vote for Donald Trump to become president, which seems like a more important topic than whether he is a good role model for young children. (She’s also bizarrely tried to create a distinction between saying she would vote for Trump, which she has done, and saying she “endorses” him, which she claims she has not done.) But when you think about it, her logic there actually made a certain amount of political sense. Whether or not it’s accurate, she could at least make the case that Trump is deeply flawed, but worthy of supporting purely for “lesser of two evils” reasons, because Hillary Clinton is so much worse.    Ayotte’s blunder here was saying Trump is actually good in his own right. She dropped the criticism of Trump and deemed him worthy of being a role model at the very moment when his personal behavior has been even more repulsive than usual (which, for him, is saying something).   Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U. S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016    For the most part, Republican candidates across the country have managed to avoid saying what they think about Trump’s controversies of the day by changing the subject to Clinton or conservative policies.  “We know that normal, ideologically orthodox conservative elected officials think Trump should be president of the United States,” Matt Yglesias wrote. “But to a striking extent, we haven’t heard whether they think it’s appropriate for a president to be tweeting about sex tapes, suggesting Mexicans can’t serve as federal judges, or musing out loud about abrogating NATO and leaving much of Eastern Europe open to Russian conquest. ” Ayotte’s gaffe shows that even GOP politicians in important Senate races haven’t quite managed to learn how to finesse this. Ayotte has tried to strike a balance between criticizing Trump and justifying her support for him  —   but in calling him a role model, she seems to have gone too far. ",-1.0
"We're All 'P-Hacking' Now. It’s got an entry in the Urban Dictionary, been discussed on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, scored a wink from Cards Against Humanity, and now it’s been featured in a clue on the TV game show Jeopardy. Metascience nerds rejoice! The term p-hacking has gone mainstream. Results from a study can be analyzed in a variety of ways, and p-hacking refers to a practice where researchers select the analysis that yields a pleasing result. The p refers to the p-value, a ridiculously complicated statistical entity that’s essentially a measure of how surprising the results of a study would be if the effect you’re looking for wasn’t there. Suppose you’re testing a pill for high blood pressure, and you find that blood pressures did indeed drop among people who took the medicine. The p-value is the probability that you’d find blood pressure reductions at least as big as the ones you measured, even if the drug was a dud and didn’t work. A p-value of 0.05 means there’s only a 5 percent chance of that scenario. By convention, a p-value of less than 0.05 gives the researcher license to say that the drug produced “statistically significant” reductions in blood pressure. Journals generally prefer to publish statistically significant results, so scientists have incentives to select ways of parsing and analyzing their data that produce a p-value under 0.05. That’s p-hacking. “It’s a great name—short, sweet, memorable, and just a little funny,” says Regina Nuzzo, a freelance science writer and senior advisor for statistics communication at the American Statistical Association. P-hacking as a term came into use as psychology and some other fields of science were experiencing a kind of existential crisis. Seminal findings were failing to replicate. Absurd results (ESP is real!) were passing peer review at well-respected academic journals. Efforts were underway to test the literature for false positives and the results weren’t looking good. Researchers began to realize that the problem might be woven into some long-standing and basic research practices. Psychologists Uri Simonsohn, Joseph Simmons, and Leif Nelson elegantly demonstrated the problem in what is now a classic paper. “False-Positive Psychology,” published in 2011, used well-accepted methods in the field to show that the act of listening to the Beatles song “When I’m Sixty-Four” could take a year and a half off someone’s age. It all started over dinner at a conference where a group of researchers was discussing some findings they found difficult to believe. Afterward, Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson decided to see how easy it would be to reverse-engineer an impossible result with a p-value of less than 0.05. “We started brainstorming—if we wanted to show an effect that isn’t true, how would you run a study to get that result without faking anything?” Simonsohn told me. They produced their absurd conclusion by exploiting what they called “researcher degrees of freedom”: the little decisions that scientists make as they’re designing a study and collecting and analyzing data. These choices include things like which observations to measure, which variables to compare, which factors to combine, and which ones to control for. Unless researchers have committed to a methodology and analysis plan in advance by preregistering a study, they are, in practice, free to make (or even change) these calls as they go. The problem, as the Beatles song experiment showed, is that this kind of fiddling around allows researchers to manipulate their study conditions until they get the answer that they want—the grownup equivalent of kids at a slumber party applying pressure on the Ouija board planchette until it spells out the words they’re looking for. A year later, the team went public with its new and better name for this phenomenon. At a psychology conference in 2012, Simonsohn gave a talk in which he used the term p-hacking for the first time. “We needed a shorter word to describe [this set of behaviors], and p-dash-something seemed to make sense,” Simmons says. “P-hacking was definitely a better term than ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ because you could use it as a noun or an adjective.” The phrase made its formal debut in a paper the team published in 2014, where they wrote “p-hacking can allow researchers to get most studies to reveal significant relationships between truly unrelated variables.” They weren’t the first to identify what can go wrong when scientists exploit researcher degrees of freedom, but by coining the term p-hacking, Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson had given researchers a language to talk about it. “Our primary goal was to make it easier for us to present our work. The ambitious goal was that it would make it easier for other people to talk to each other about the topic,” Nelson says. “The popular acceptance of the term has outstripped our original ambitions.” “It is brilliant marketing,” says Brian Nosek, cofounder of the Center for Open Science. The term p-hacking brings together a constellation of behaviors that methodologists have long recognized as undesirable, assigns them a name, and identifies their consequence, he adds. Nosek credits the term with helping researchers “organize and think about how their behaviors impact the quality of their evidence.” As a wider conversation about reproducibility spread through the field of psychology, rival ways of describing p-hacking and related issues gained attention too. Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman had used the term “the garden of forking paths” to describe the array of choices that researchers can select from when they’re embarking on a study analysis. Data mining, fishing expeditions and data dredging are other descriptors that had been applied to the act of p-hacking. Gelman and his colleague Eric Loken didn’t care for these alternatives. In 2013, they wrote that they “regret the spread of the terms ‘fishing’ and ‘p-hacking’ (and even ‘researcher degrees of freedom’),” because they create the “misleading implication that researchers were consciously trying out many different analyses on a single data set.” The “garden of forking paths,” on the other hand, more aptly describes how researchers can get lost in all the decisions that go into data analysis, and not even realize that they've gone astray. “People say p-hacking and it sounds like someone’s cheating,” Gelman says. “The flip side is that people know they didn’t cheat, so they don’t think they did anything wrong. But even if you don’t cheat, it’s still a moral error to misanalyze data on a problem of consequence.” Simmons is sympathetic to this criticism. “We probably didn’t think enough about the connotations of the word ‘hacking,’ which implies intentions,” he says. “It sounds worse than we wanted it to.” He and his colleagues have been very explicit that p-hacking isn’t necessarily a nefarious endeavor, but rather a human one, and one that they themselves had been guilty of. At its core, p-hacking is really about confirmation bias—the human tendency to seek and preferentially find evidence that confirms what we’d like to believe, while turning a blind eye to things that might contradict our preferred truths. The “hacking” part makes it sound like some sort of immoral behavior, and that’s not helpful, Simmons says. “People in power don’t understand the inevitability of p-hacking in the absence of safeguards against it. They think p-hacking is something that evil people do. And since we’re not evil, we don’t have to worry about it.” But Simmons says that p-hacking is a human default: “It’s something that every single person will do, that I continue to do when I don’t preregister my studies.” Without safeguards in place, he notes, it’s almost impossible to avoid. Still, there’s something indisputably appealing about the term p-hacking. “You can’t say that someone got their data and garden-of-forking-pathed it,” Nelson adds. “We wanted to make it into a single action term.” The genesis of the term p-hacking made it easier to talk about this phenomenon across fields by harkening to the fact that this was a behavior—something researchers were actually doing in their work. Even though it was developed by psychologists, the term p-hacking was soon being used by people talking about medicine, nutrition, biology or genetics, Nelson says. “Each of these fields have their own version, and they were like, great. Now we have a term to describe whatever is our version of semilegitimate statistical practices.” The fact that p-hacking has now spread out of science and into pop culture could indicate a watershed moment in the public understanding of science, and a growing awareness that studies can’t always be taken at face value. But it’s hard to know exactly how the term is being understood at large. It’s even possible that the popularization of p-hacking has turned the scientific process into a caricature of itself, reinforcing harmful ideas about the scientific method. “I would hate for the concept of p-hacking boiled down to something like ‘you can make statistics say anything you want’ or, worse, that ‘scientists are liars,’” says Nuzzo, the science writer. “Because neither of those things is true.” In a perfect world, the wider public would understand that p-hacking refers not to some lousy tendency or lazy habit particular to researchers, but one that’s present everywhere. We all p-hack, to some extent, every time we set out to understand the evidence in the world around us. If there’s a takeaway here, it’s that science is hard—and sometimes our human foibles make it even harder.",0.0
"The Devin Nunes Memo: Reading Between the Lines. After weeks of Twitter users demanding Congress #ReleaseTheMemo, the House Intelligence Committee—chaired by Republican Devin Nunes— disclosed the contentious four-page report to the public Friday, after President Donald Trump signed off on its release. And while, as expected, the document alleges that federal law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers in investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, national security experts see something very different. In fact, they see almost nothing at all—or at least not enough to make any definitive judgement calls. As had been rumored, the memo details supposedly improper actions by law enforcement officials in seeking a warrant to wiretap Carter Page, one of Trump's campaign advisors. But understanding what the memo says—and, critically, doesn't say—requires familiarity with the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which governs requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, better known as FISA. Those who know the law best say the memo is largely bunk. 'The dossier and Steele and all that—it’s cherrypicking a piece of what was probably a 50, or 60, or 100 page application.' 'Despite what this memo tries to imply, it’s not like the Steele dossier turned the FBI onto Page. The #ReleaseTheMemo campaign was always disingenuous at best As was the previous Devin Nunes campaign against ""unmasking,"" another easily misrepresented cornerstone of the FISA process In fact, Devin Nunes has frequently gone out of his way to cloud FISA issues, seemingly at the White House's bidding ",0.0

"Bill Maher hosted conservative Tomi Lahren on ‘Real Time.’ They were both preaching to their own choirs..      A few months ago, conservative talk show host Tomi Lahren had a surprisingly civil chat with Trevor Noah on “The Daily Show. ” On Friday, Lahren appeared on another liberal talk show  —   HBO’s “Real Time With Bill Maher. ” How did the discussion go? It depends on whom you ask.   The liberals and Never Trumpers think they win every argument but then again, they also think they won the election.. pic. twitter.   —   Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) February 4, 2017   In many ways, it makes sense that Maher would host Lahren. He’s a staunch advocate for free speech and frequently hosts guests who disagree with him. (One of those guests is conservative pundit Ann Coulter. Maher told the New York Times in 2009 that they were good friends.) On “The Daily Show,” Lahren and Noah went    on Donald Trump and Black Lives Matter for more than 26 minutes. Lahren got far fewer words in on “Real Time,” where she was joined by fellow panelists Republican strategist Rick Wilson and Missouri Democrat Jason Kander, who served in Afghanistan. (Watch Kander and Lahren debate Maher’s other guests on ‘Overtime’). Maher kicked off the panel by discussing the Trump administration’s efforts to overturn regulations enacted by former president Barack Obama using the Congressional Review Act. Congress has already acted to overturn a rule designed to prevent   companies from dumping debris into streams and a regulation requiring more extensive background checks for gun purchases by Social Security recipients who have been deemed mentally incapable of managing their own affairs. “This looks like special interest stuff. How does letting a coal company dump the sludge in the river help the little guy?” Maher asked, citing Trump’s campaign rhetoric. “The forgotten American, I would say,” Lahren answered. “Because the coal industry has been attacked. Obama went to war against the coal industry and they saw massive declines, and they were on their way out the door. You look at these   …     little towns. Look at the American worker. We need to take a minute, take a step back and realize.   …    ” Maher interrupted her. “Even if we allowed coal, why allow the company to dump the sludge in the river?” “It’s a more complex issue than that, though,” Lahren said. “And some of this regulation was   upon. ” Maher also brought up the deadly Yemen raid that left a Navy SEAL and several civilians dead. “It was a huge f —  up,” Maher said. “Now I’m not saying that’s all Donald Trump’s fault, although it doesn’t look good. “But here’s the thing,” Maher continued. “If it was Hillary Clinton, this would be the new Benghazi. ” “So we shouldn’t talk about intentions,” Lahren said. “Intentions?” Maher asked. “You’re right  —   on the left, and the right. We shouldn’t,” Lahren said. “I would also agree that if Hillary did this, you’re right, there would be a backlash from those on the right and they would say it was the second coming of Benghazi, and I agree with you. So we should stop talking about intentions and just go to the merit of the thing. ” So, Maher asked, would Lahren also agree that it was “bulls —  ” for Republicans to blame Benghazi on Clinton? “No, I’m saying it would have been unfair to peg this on Hillary. It would be unfair to blame it on Trump,” Lahren said. Maher tried again. “It was bulls —   to blame Benghazi on Hillary  —   we know that, right?” “No,” Lahren said. “That’s another discussion to be had. ” Kander agreed that Clinton would have faced harsher criticism if she had been the one to carry out the Yemen raid and said that the people who died in Benghazi were used “as political chess pieces. ” Kander suggested that Lahren probably didn’t know the names of the Americans who died in Benghazi. She did  —   and named them all. “Good for you,” Kander said. “You two have just proved absolutely nothing,” Maher said.

No,” Lahren said as the audience erupted in laughter. Maher cited a poll that said   of Republicans believe racism against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against minorities. He asked Lahren if she agreed. “I think there’s certainly an element of division that needs to be addressed, yeah, as evidenced at UC Berkeley the other night,” she said. “There’s certain issues in society where we’re becoming more divided, and it’s not just blacks against whites or whites against blacks, it’s all of us against each other. And it’s toxic. ” “But that’s not what I asked,” Maher said. “As we sit here today, I do think that there is an element of racism against white individuals, I do,” Lahren said. Wilson took the opportunity to weigh in here: “Since I’m a conservative, but not a Trump person, let me just say this. That’s absurd. F —  ing crazy. ” This post has been updated.

"Melania and Ivanka Trump, following tradition of western visitors, forgo headscarves in Saudi Arabia.           RIYADH, Saudi Arabia  —   The last time a U. S. first lady visited this Middle Eastern kingdom, she was criticized for appearing in public without a headscarf. Michelle Obama was blasted on Saudi social media  —   as well as by a prominent American tweeter named Donald Trump  —   for not covering her head during her 2015 visit, as women are expected to do in this conservative Islamic country. So there was some anticipation about whether first lady Melania Trump and first daughter Ivanka Trump would cover their heads during their visit this weekend to Riyadh. They did not, in keeping with the modern tradition of visiting western dignitaries.

"The OA review: If I told you anything about Netflix’s new show, you wouldn’t believe me.  How best to describe The OA, Netflix’s new   …     well, that’s what I’m trying to figure out here  —   how to describe this thing.    At times, it feels like the sort of show that would be a background joke in an episode of BoJack Horseman   something Jack Donaghy would pitch on 30 Rock.      Rating  2        At other times, it feels as if   Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij discussed the plot of Lost with a time traveler at a   end of the world party, only both Marling and Batmanglij were incredibly high, then wrote down what they could remember the next day in between shifts at their New Age bookstore jobs. At still other times, it reveals itself to have a mythology that’s equal parts   book of Revelation, Sense8, and those installments of The Family Circus where the dead grandparents return to watch over their grandchildren as angel ghosts.     Have I mentioned that as soon as the word “angel” is uttered, you’ll say, “Oh, I know what The OA stands for,” then spend roughly seven hours waiting to be proved right? Have I mentioned that the show’s big dramatic climax involves very exciting tai chi? Have I mentioned that the cast is stacked with people you’ve loved in other things?    The important thing is that The OA defies description. To talk about it is to rob it of some of its weirdo power. I can’t precisely tell you if I liked or hated this show. I don’t even know. I liked some of it. I hated some of it. But I enjoyed watching it because I couldn’t believe it was a real television program. In that sense, then, there’s only one way to describe The OA: This is the peak of Peak TV.    The one question you’ll keep asking while watching: How did this show get made?             The OA exists because the television industry has expanded so rapidly that there’s a huge surplus of content providers and not enough content to keep them all fed. In that sense, Netflix deciding to make a show with Marling and Batmanglij (who were behind the intriguing indie film The Sound of My Voice) makes sense. The show also boosts the producing power of Brad Pitt and his team at Plan B, who have been behind a lot of great films (Selma, The Big Short, etc. ). So from that point of view, Netflix would have been stupid not to make something with this team. And superficially speaking, The OA is the sort of thing Netflix fans could really get into. It follows a young woman named Prairie (Marling) who disappeared seven years ago but is discovered jumping from a bridge into the water below. She survives, returns to her parents in Michigan, and then starts mumbling about how she’s “the OA. ” Oh, and Prairie used to be blind, but now she can see.        Related Watch The OA on Netflix    She won’t talk about it with anyone but a small group of teenage boys (and their teacher) to whom she relates her life story. This leads to the first indication that The OA won’t be like other TV shows: At 57 minutes into its first episode  —   which runs 70  —   the show’s opening credits unspool, and then it cuts from 2016 Michigan to 1987 Russia. Sure, I thought. Right. We’re doing this. From there, The OA cuts freely between the OA telling her story and Prairie’s upbringing, first in Russia, as the child of oligarchs, then in the United States as the adopted daughter of a childless couple who found her in an attic. (I promise you: When I sound like I’m making up a plot point from this show, I am not.) In the meantime, she nearly dies in a school bus crash, which adds a whole other plane of existence (where she communes with a goddess) to the tale. Batmanglij directed the series, and he has a good eye for contrasting the humdrum reality of the OA’s return to where she grew up and the grand, epic sweep of her backstory. The show’s mythology is occasionally enjoyable in its sheer audacity, and the cast is really great, particularly Jason Isaacs as a mysterious man Prairie meets, and Phyllis Smith as a teacher who falls under the OA’s sway. But the series fails one crucial test: the “oh, just come the fuck on” test. And to explain why that’s the case, I’m going to have to go into a little more detail. Spoilers follow. (Yes, I’ve barely spoiled this series so far.) All of The OA’s best qualities can’t obscure the suspension of disbelief it requires             If you’re wondering where Prairie went in her seven missing years, I can tell you: She was kidnapped by a man played by Isaacs, who holds her in a glass cage in his basement, along with other people who’ve had   experiences. He’s trying to establish contact with the other side. So he keeps drowning them, over and over again, hoping to do just that. Anyway, as Prairie and her compatriots (whose number slowly swells to five) are killed, many, many times, only for the astral plane to spit them back up because it’s not ready for them yet, they slowly begin to realize that they are being gifted with “movements,” which will give them certain superpowers when performed in tandem. In theory, this is a nifty idea; in practice, it ends up looking more like people doing angry aerobics at each other as dramatic music swells on the soundtrack.                                         I want to believe that you could make a good TV show about anything, and I love, in particular, the way Batmanglij and Marling convey the abject horror of having your face covered with a container slowly filling with water. Yes, this series spends way too long with a bunch of people trapped in glass cages  —   like, several episodes  —   and it starts to take on some of the claustrophobia of its setting. But the revelations are   and the general idea of   experiencers having the key to humanity’s future has promise.    But in the end, it’s just too much. The idea that the only thing humanity needs to unlock other dimensions of power is interpretive dance is one that requires much, much more grounding than The OA is willing to grant it. You either go with it, because you buy everything the OA (the character) is telling you  —   or you don’t. And I didn’t. The series banks everything on the weird tonal whiplash that results from flashing between the mystical otherworldly bullshit of the OA’s story and the more realistic tales of her attempts to reintegrate with the little town she grew up in, but it never finds a way to make the mystical bullshit believable. There’s a potentially good reason for that, but it arrives far too late to make a difference. And when realism and mysticism converge in the finale’s final 20 minutes, it’s absolutely ludicrous. (The angel dancing foils a school shooting  —   but only because it distracts the utterly baffled shooter long enough for someone to knock him down. Nevertheless, a stray bullet hits The OA in the heart!)  And yet I’m still glad I watched this thing. Its very existence serves as proof that TV is more than willing to take wild swings on ideas that barely rise to the level of “” and there were several moments per episode when I could feel myself falling under the sway of whatever kooky dream Marling and Batmanglij had cooked up for me, only to be pulled out. There’s something in The OA, even if that something is complete and utter dross. It’s too   in its best scenes  —   usually the ones featuring the teenage boys trying to navigate this weird spiritual awakening they’re going through  —   to be entirely written off, and I admired its willingness, from time to time, to call bullshit on itself. But those moments are usually too little and too late.  The show opens with a woman jumping off a bridge, then proceeds to give her a bunch of followers who really would jump off a bridge if she asked them to. Some viewers will join them. I’m still standing on the bridge, though, hoping everybody else is having a great fall. The OA is streaming on Netflix.  The 18 best TV shows airing right now   ",-1.0
"The US just formally accused Russia of interfering in the presidential election.  Late Friday afternoon, the US intelligence community made it official: Washington believes Moscow is intentionally meddling in the November US elections.    The claim came in a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Security published on the DNI website. The two agencies formally accused Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee and dumping its private emails to WikiLeaks, which published them just before the Democratic convention in July. The disclosures forced the resignation of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, infuriated supporters of Hillary Clinton rival Bernie Sanders, and cast a pall over the Democratic convention in Philadelphia.  “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process,” the statement read. “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities. ” That’s strong stuff, and new: Unnamed US officials have spent months hinting that Russia was responsible, but the Obama administration has previously refrained from formally blaming Moscow for the hack (or from   hinting that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his top aides were involved).     Now that the US has officially leveled the accusation, the move could result in new sanctions on Russian officials  —   and even affect the US election.    Why this is new  —   and why it matters That Russia is responsible for the hack hasn’t really been in doubt for a while, though the Kremlin has steadily denied any involvement. The   evidence is about as good as it gets in cyberspace. ”The forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations is very strong,” Thomas Rid, a professor at King’s College London who studies cybersecurity, writes in Vice. ”The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys.”    Russia has meddled in European politics and elections for years, often by deliberately spreading false news articles, but its motivation here isn’t entirely clear. The Kremlin could simply be trying to sow chaos, undermine confidence in the US election system, and embarrass America.  Or it could be actively trying to elect Donald Trump. They did target the DNC, and leak emails that exacerbated tension between Clinton and Sanders supporters. Moreover, Trump has made no secret of his love for Putin and openly espouses policies (like undermining NATO) that objectively further Kremlin interests. Either way, it’s not something the US government wants to tolerate. So for months now, a debate has been raging inside the Obama administration about whether to go after Russia publicly for it. Some favored publicly attributing the hacks to Russia; others favored some more indirect form of retaliation, like hacking the Russian government right back.    “The internal debate is rife with political and diplomatic concerns, including a fear that acting before November might appear unduly partisan,” the Washington Post’s Ellen Nakashima wrote in early September. “US intelligence agencies are also wary that a public attribution might disclose sources and methods. ” The Obama administration has also been under mounting pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including from leading Democrats. In late September, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff, Democrats with senior roles on their respective chamber’s intelligence committee, released a statement publicly blaming Russia for the hack and calling on Americans to “stand together” against Russian interference. Clearly, the   side prevailed. This opens up the door for more overt punishments of Russia, including imposing a special slate of   economic sanctions created by the Obama administration in 2015. So this is a serious escalation on Washington’s part. The question is how Moscow will respond: Will this deter Russia from further interference in the US election, or cause them to go even further? The impact on the US election            It’s not for nothing that the Obama administration was worried about looking partisan. Whenever they announced that Russia was responsible for the cyberattacks, it would make Trump  —   who has repeatedly suggested that Moscow wasn’t behind the DNC hack  —   look bad. One of Trump’s most memorable missteps happened on precisely this topic, when he called for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton this July.    ”Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing,” Trump said. ”I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” That went too far, even for many of Trump’s supporters. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s office issued a terse statement distancing himself from Trump’s stance: “Russia is a global menace led by a devious thug. Putin should stay out of this election. ” The timing for this announcement is also quite bad for Trump. The second presidential debate is on Sunday. National   moderators Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper would have almost certainly pressed Trump about his past comments about Putin and why he appears to be pushing   policies. They now have grist for an even more pointed question: Why, Mr. Trump, would Moscow be willing to take the risk of going this far to try to ensure your election? More broadly, there’s a question of whether Moscow’s retaliation will affect the US election directly. The nightmare scenario is Russia actually hacking US voting computers and altering the vote total. In the   statement, US officials offered nothing but soothing words. “It would be extremely difficult for someone, including a   actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion,” they explain. “States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process. ” That doesn’t mean that Russia won’t look for  —   and potentially find  —   some new way of causing mischief. We’ll find out in the next 30 days. ",-1.0

Here’s who has won so far, and when we might expect results, sorted by what time voting ends:    Georgia: Clinton wins, Trump wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 76 Republicans (20 percent threshold); 102 Democrats    Vermont: Sanders wins, Trump wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 16 Republicans (20 percent threshold); 16 Democrats Virginia: Clinton wins, Trump wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 49 Republicans (no threshold); 95 Democrats    Alabama: Trump wins, Clinton wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 50 Republicans (20 percent threshold); 53 Democrats (all states have a 15 percent threshold) Massachusetts: Trump wins, Clinton wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 42 Republicans (5 percent threshold); 91 Democrats Oklahoma: Cruz wins, Sanders wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 43 Republicans (15 percent threshold); 38 Democrats    Tennessee: Trump wins, Clinton wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 58 Republicans (20 percent threshold); 67 Democrats Texas: Clinton wins, Cruz wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 155 Republicans (20 percent threshold); 222 Democrats Arkansas: Clinton wins, Trump wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 40 Republicans (15 percent threshold); 32 Democrats Minnesota: Rubio wins, Sanders wins Who voted: Republicans and Democrats Delegates: 38 Republicans (10 percent threshold); 77 Democrats Colorado: Sanders wins Who voted: Democrats (Republicans are holding caucuses, but without a presidential preference vote) Delegates: 66 Democratic delegates Alaska: Cruz wins Who voted: Republicans (Democrats caucus March 26)    Delegates: 28 Republican delegates (13 percent threshold)    Elsewhere Hillary Clinton won American Samoa’s Democratic caucuses, which control six delegates. Democrats Abroad, which represents Democratic voters living overseas and sends 12 delegates pledged to candidates to the national convention, begins a   primary March 1, including some opportunities to vote in person.

"Racial profiling by police isn’t just an American problem: I’m experiencing it in Germany.  It was a foggy morning in March. I was new to the neighborhood, having moved to Berlin a few days before. My jet lag kept me awake until the early hours of the morning. I needed to clear my head.     I was wearing a black track jacket, a pair of leggings, and my bright purple and orange running sneakers. I heard someone yelling at me on the other side of the track. I remember my headphones getting tangled in my headband as I struggled to pull them out. When the person came closer, I realized it was a police officer.  All I understood was “hello. ” He continued talking in German for a good minute until he realized I didn’t understand.  “Excuse me,” he said. “What are you doing here? Where are you from? Can I see your ID?”     My first thought: Oh, great, I literally just arrived in Germany and a police officer is asking me questions. Am I doing something wrong?    I told him I didn’t carry my ID. All I had were my apartment keys.  He continued to ask me questions: “Where do you live?” “Why are you here so early?”    I told him I was sorry that I didn’t have my ID and would remember to carry it with me next time.   Read more        I’m a black   and this is the real truth about race and policing 5 things I wish people understood about bias in American police departments.   He told me I should always have my ID on me and left. I continued running, blasting my iPod. I didn’t think much of the encounter at the time. I assumed it was a   thing, or maybe there was an ordinance of some sort for running in the park that early in the morning I didn’t know about. As a woman of color, I didn’t think race could be a reason why he stopped me. I just figured it was because I was the only person in the park. I also didn’t think I would encounter the police again for the duration of my   fellowship at Correctiv, an investigative nonprofit newsroom in Berlin, unless I had to talk to them for a story.  When I got back to my apartment I recalled the conversations I’d had with a few people I knew in Berlin about racism in Germany. They told me Berlin was generally safe and that I should avoid the some of the smaller Eastern towns in Germany, where I might run into  . The only checks I could expect were at the   (public transportation) for my ticket, but not for an ID.      They also told me German citizens by law are required to carry a national ID card, but no one I know had ever been stopped and asked for it, except at the borders and on the train or at the airport. I was told I shouldn’t carry my passport at all times, especially because I might lose it. No one ever mentioned that I could get stopped while running in the park. And when I told these friends about my encounter with the police officer while running, they assured me it was a   event. No one thought I would continue to get stopped. I’ve had my ID checked by the police 23 times in the nine months I’ve lived in Berlin Nine months and 23 identification checks later, I’m tired of getting asked where I’m from and where my ID is. I’m annoyed by the grocery store security guard asking me if I’m going to purchase the things I have in my cart whenever I stop in the store to think about what else I am forgetting on my list. I’m annoyed by the police officer who picks me out of my group of white friends and asks for my ID. I’m annoyed by the police officer who asks me where I’m going on a Sunday morning walk to the park and asks to see my ID.  These stops have made me question what people see when they look at me. Getting humiliated on the street by authorities has shown me that for some people, I’m just another “brown” person who could be a terrorist or a criminal. When I show the police officers my passport, they always seem surprised that I’m from the US and not from India because of my skin color and appearance. It’s not only insulting, but it also shows me that their image of what an American person could look like is narrow. I understand that for many people, I might be the first person of color they’ve ever met or seen, but this does not give anyone the right to question my nationality or assume I’m a criminal. At the beginning I felt ostracized by these encounters, but I’m sad to say I’ve gotten so used to it that I feel despondent. I want to know what can be done to help these officers understand that each time they stop me or another person of color, they are reinforcing the stereotypes we all deal with on a daily basis.  What also worries me is the message this sends to the refugees who have been for the most part welcomed into Germany with open arms. It makes me wonder about how many others are getting stopped and how they are dealing with it. If I feel this angered and hopeless, I can’t imagine what someone who seeks asylum is feeling, especially when they thought they were going to be in a safe place that gave them more respect but instead are singled out for the color of their skin.  My experience with the German police has also made me reassess my attitude toward their role of making sure the country is safe. I don’t really know what my rights are living in Germany and what I can and can’t be asked for. It’s also more difficult for me to answer questions from authorities because I don’t speak German. And because I’ve been stopped for identification so many times and feel targeted, it makes me question if I’m really truly safe. I understand that they might find the suspect for a crime during these ID checks, but it’s hard for me to wrap my head around how people of color can truly trust the police here when they are so often seen as terrorists or criminals.      This experience has helped me empathize and think a lot about how people of color in the US feel when the police target them. I know plenty of people of color who’ve lost trust in the police and don’t know whom to turn to when they witness or are a victim of an actual crime. This is exactly how I feel in Germany. I don’t know if I would trust the police here to believe me when there is a crime happening because some of them have made me feel as if I’m a criminal already.  Getting my ID checked so often makes me question myself I talked to my colleagues at Correctiv  —   mostly white men  —   about these ID checks. All of them but one, a Syrian refugee, were shocked. They urged me to tell my story, but at first I was skeptical. They also urged me to request any information the police had recorded on me, because if I was going to tell this story there would be a lot of people coming forward saying this was impossible since they had never experienced such a thing.   I spoke to my fellowship,   OpenNews, and they were shocked as well. They had never heard of such a thing happening before  —   they’d had two fellows in Berlin previously, but the prior fellows weren’t people of color. They urged me to seek out groups to talk to that might have experience with ID checks.  When I reached out to a few people of color I knew in Berlin, they were surprised, but not for the same reason my colleagues and fellowship were. It was because I’m a woman. Normally, they said, these identification checks happen to men of color, especially black men, who are presumed to be drug dealers by the police.  Each time I get checked, I question what I’m wearing or if I’m doing something I shouldn’t be doing. Why me? And each time, I know I shouldn’t ask myself these questions, because I know it clearly has nothing to do with either of those things. It’s gotten to the point where I have a copy of my ID folded so small, it fits in my running clothes so that I have it in case I get stopped.  My life in the United States  I’m a   Indian American. I grew up in a diverse township in New Jersey. I never thought about people singling me out for my skin color or family background. I had my fair share of getting made fun of, especially because I was what they called a “geek. ” I got made fun of for wearing glasses, called “four eyes,” for always having braids in my hair, and for having “weird” food like idlis for lunch. Looking back, I was naive in thinking that these comments weren’t targeted toward my family background. I didn’t think much about why people said the things they did to me.     I never thought about whether I looked “American” or “Indian” while growing up. That changed when I went to college. My college, Ohio University, was in the heart of Appalachia, and I was one of a few Indian Americans on campus. One of my first memories was when a woman in the student resources center spoke really slowly to me until I asked a question. Once she heard me talk and realized I spoke English, she spoke faster.  Another time, while I was working at the TV station on campus, a person in the newsroom told me I needed to put more powder on and have brighter lights because the lights used for everyone else weren’t bright enough for my dark skin. Even worse: The person said this in front of other people, which only reinforced the idea that people of color don’t belong on television. It made me hesitant to want to continue to work toward a goal of being on national TV as a reporter one day. This person also suggested if I wanted to continue doing TV, I should consider shortening my name and getting a name that was “easier to pronounce. ” That was a punch in the gut and made me want to quit journalism.   Read more        American policing is broken. Here’s how to fix it. Step one: Police must admit there’s a problem.   Several times while I was out reporting, I was told by people I’d interview on the street and in trailer parks, “I don’t speak your language, honey, so don’t bother wasting your time here,” or, “I don’t speak Hindu, sorry. ” I also had a guy pull out his gun when I approached his lawn, after he shouted, “Your kind don’t belong here. ”  At first, I was angry at these people. Soon, I felt bad for them because they didn’t know anything else but their small bubble of white people.  The color of my skin was speaking for me. It didn’t matter that I am a US citizen. It was the fact I had a strange name that they choked on to pronounce and prompted them to ask if I had a nickname. And the fact I didn’t look like what they thought was “American” since they never saw a   person in their life.   So living in Germany, I wasn’t completely outraged by the racism, since I’ve experienced different types before. I’ve been trying to pinpoint why I feel ostracized in a different way when I hear racist remarks in the US versus my experience here in Germany. In the US, I just feel bad for people who aren’t educated enough to know what the difference between “Hindi” and “Hindu” is and how stupid they sound when they say I don’t belong. Their statements are harsh, but I know they are not true and I can dismiss them.     In Germany, there are no statements made toward me. It’s just a few questions that make me feel invalidated. Both are ways of people making someone else feel like an outsider, but the questioning makes me feel as if there are more fingers pointed at me. If it were questions from ignorant everyday people, I don’t think I’d be as bothered. It’s because this uncertainty is coming from authority figures (like the police) that society tells us to trust and respect. When they are uncertain about me, I’m uncertain about their role to keep people safe and feel like I’m accused of doing something wrong since the questions are so short and accusatory.  How big a problem is racial profiling in Germany? The third time I got checked, I asked myself: What data are they collecting, and how many other people are having this happen? I can’t just let myself be angry about these checks. I know it can’t just be me. As a journalist, it bothers me that others may be getting hurt in the same way and may not have the experience dealing with racism before. Germans are very private people and are very cautious about giving out personal information. There is a form anyone can fill out to request the information authorities are storing about them. Curious to see what the police department had on me, I sent in a request and got a note back stating they had no information on me. So why was it that the police officers had a notebook and seemed to be writing down something when they asked me questions?  I followed up this records request to the Berlin police department, who responded saying they don’t racially profile anyone because that’s illegal  —   and they don’t do illegal things. The police said it only collects information on raids in the   “danger zones. ” These danger zones are designated areas the police frequently visit because of high crimes. I also asked for the location of these danger zones. They told me getting this information would be harmful to the police security practices.  I also talked with more than a dozen people of color who’ve also experienced identification checks from the police. I met many of these people through racial profiling advocacy organizations and through friends of friends. A few of the refugees I spoke to told me they felt ostracized coming to a country where they thought they’d be accepted and instead feel as if they don’t belong. They too questioned whether they were wearing something inappropriate or walking on a street they weren’t supposed to. Another man with two young children told me he was stopped and asked if those were his children. His children are mixed black and white and looked, according to the police, “more ‘white’ than ‘black. ’” When I sat down with the Berlin police spokesperson, Thomas Neuendorf, he said he was shocked that I’d been stopped so many times. He said the checks I had experienced could be seen as illegal, since police officers only perform checks on areas where there is a suspicion of crime. He went on to assure me the police only do checks on “people who look suspicious” because the person fits a profile of someone they are already looking for.     He said the police wouldn’t search a “blond,   person. ” He added that the police force has several people of migrant backgrounds and has intercultural competence trainings to prevent racial profiling from happening. But, he said, training is different from the reality of being a police officer, so they can’t help if someone turns out to be racist despite all the trainings. He apologized on behalf of the department for what I’d experienced. Hearing the words “  person” alarmed me. This is the root of the problem. Who comes up with the definition of who looks German or Australian or American or Indian? When are we going to move past this and realize that a person’s skin color does not define their nationality? I also wondered what goes in the intercultural trainings the officers went through. I asked Neuendorf about the words “  person,” and he said he’d used the wrong words and that phrase isn’t what he actually meant.   Still, I know that the dozen people I spoke to are only a small fraction of the number of people experiencing racial profiling in Germany and in Europe. I spoke to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance as well as other organizations that have been researching this issue for a while. And I know this answer I’ve gotten from the Berlin police is not acceptable.  This experience made me see how authority figures can reinforce damaging stereotypes I’m not the only one asking questions. In August, a member of the state parliament in Berlin asked about how the police are handling racial profiling, citing research from Commission Against Racism and Intolerance as well as the United Nations, which had a report on institutional racism by law enforcement in Germany. Similar to what I was told from the police, he was also told the German police departments don’t racially profile.   I’m interested in hearing the stories of people who’ve been profiled by the police. If you’re living in Germany, I want to know where and how the police stopped you and what kind of data the police have collected. I’m doing more interviews in the coming weeks into this subject and want to hear from you.    This experience has opened my eyes to how authority figures can reinforce stereotypes. I empathize with those who feel lost because of accusations and targeting from authority figures. My hope is that by raising awareness about these issues, more people will come forward and tell their story and show people that what they are doing is not acceptable. I also hope people will educate themselves and understand that skin color should not define what nationality they are, especially in a time when we are welcoming people from different backgrounds into our countries.

"Republicans may not want Trump to end Obamacare payments.  Some influential Republicans in Congress don’t want a fight President Trump is threatening to pick over extra Obamacare payments to insurers. Trump suggested this week that as Congress seeks to fund the government beyond April, Republicans should refuse to pay for   subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act to   Americans. There’s widespread agreement that without the subsidies, insurers would be forced to hike premiums next year, worsening conditions in the Obamacare insurance marketplaces. The president told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that not only would such a move cause Obamacare to “die,” it could also be used to force Democrats to negotiate on repealing the   law altogether. “Without the payments, Obamacare is gone, just gone,” Trump said.  [Trump’s threat prompts Democrats to play hardball over Obamacare payments]  Many Republicans are well aware that the public is likely to blame them for premium increases, now that they control both Congress and the White House and have so far failed to agree on a   replacement plan. And Democrats are keenly aware of the shifting dynamics, seizing every opportunity they can to insist Republicans now own the   law.  The Democratic leadership in Congress says it will hold up the government funding bill that expires on April 28 in order to secure the payments if Trump decides to withhold them. But Republicans are unlikely to want to shut down the government  —   or for Trump to withhold the payments in the first place. “I don’t think Democrats will let this happen, but I frankly don’t think the Republicans want it to happen either,” said Timothy Jost, a   professor at Washington and Lee University. Rep. Greg Walden ( .) who, as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, helped craft the GOP   plan, told constituents this week that the subsidies need to be funded, period. “It was a commitment made by the government to the insurers and the people,” Walden said Wednesday at a town hall in his district. “That needs to happen. ” Rep. Tom Cole ( .) who chairs the powerful Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over health care, has also said it’s important to fund the payments for insurers, although he stressed it’s a decision that the House leadership would have to make. “It’s probably the right thing to do, I think,” Cole told The Washington Post last month. “Otherwise you’re going to have insurance companies exiting the market. ” Other top Republicans are remaining quiet about how to handle the subsidies, letting the White House lead the way. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( .) isn’t taking a position. A  Brady spokeswoman said Friday that the congressman “believes the administration is taking important steps to stabilize Obamacare’s collapsing marketplace. ”      (Peter   Washington Post)   The Trump administration must decide whether it will continue pursuing a GOP lawsuit to block the subsidies. The House sued the Obama administration for awarding the subsidies without a clear congressional appropriation and won in federal court last year. The Obama administration appealed the decision. Now the GOP has the White House on its side  —   and a new concern that Republicans will bear the public blame for problems with Obamacare. Trump’s victory created a tricky new situation that House Republicans surely didn’t envision when they filed the lawsuit, said Bill Pierce, a  health policy expert at APCO Worldwide. “It is a situation entirely of their own doing,” Pierce said. Republicans have said they were fighting the awarding of insurer payments without permission from Congress  —   not the subsidies themselves. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) hasn’t said whether he wants to fund the subsidies in a spending bill later this month, and his office didn’t respond Friday to a query about the issue. “We believe in Congress retaining its lawmaking power, but this lawsuit hasn’t run its course,” Ryan said late last month. “While the lawsuit is running its course, the administration is exercising their discretion with respect to the [  reductions]. ” The   law requires marketplace insurers to discount extra insurance costs beyond the monthly premium  —   such as deductibles and    —   for people earning less than 250 percent of the poverty level. Without federal payments to cover those discounts, it’s estimated that insurers would hike premiums by an average of 19 percent. That reality is leading law makers such as Walden and Cole to back the subsidies, even if they want to get rid of the underlying law. The   reductions would cost an estimated $7 billion or $8 billion in the next year, but with that cost already built in, Congress wouldn’t have to come up with extra money to fund them. If Trump pushes for withholding the payments, it could fuel a clash between these lawmakers and conservatives who want to damage Obamacare in any way they can. “I’m not alone in my party in [wanting to fund the   reductions] but there are a lot in my party that don’t think that,” Walden said. Insurers are watching the situation with trepidation, with rapidly approaching deadlines for announcing whether they will continue selling plans on the insurance marketplaces next year. Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for the trade association America’s Health Insurance Plans, said more plans will likely exit without the   reductions. “A lot of plans are very likely to drop out of the market because of continued instability,” Grow said.

"Scientists find new antibiotic in the human nose.      Scientists have discovered a bacterium living inside the human nose that produces an antibiotic capable of killing one of the most    pathogens  —   a pathogen that causes serious, even deadly skin and wound infections, bloodstream infections and pneumonia. German researchers found that this antibacterial substance was effective in treating skin infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature. The scientists said the substance, which they named lugdunin, has potent antimicrobial effects against a wide range of bacteria, including   strains such as   S. aureus (MRSA) and   Enterococcus bacteria. The number of MRSA infections is among the highest of all   threats. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 80, 000 invasive MRSA infections and more than 11, 000 related deaths occurred in 2011, the last year for which data is available. The scientists said their find represents the first known example of a new class of antibiotics. That’s particularly welcome news given the urgent global problem of   superbugs and the dwindling arsenal of drugs to replace ones that no longer work.   [The superbug that doctors have been dreading just arrived in the U. S.]   Until now, conventional antibiotic discovery has focused on looking for compounds from bacteria living in dirt. But identifying novel compound structures from soil microbes has been getting harder. The new research, from Andreas Peschel and colleagues at the University of Tübingen, suggests that the immense variety of microorganisms living in the human body, particularly in the nose, may be a potential source of new antibiotics. “These organisms, or the antibiotics they produce, might serve as   leads,” Kim Lewis of Northeastern University in Boston wrote in an accompanying commentary. Lewis, who was not involved in the study, directs Northeastern’s Antimicrobial Discovery Center and was part of the team that last year identified teixobactin, a new class of antibiotic in dirt that fights bacteria in a way that prevents bacteria from becoming resistant to it.              Caption   The White House has made the germs a serious priority.   Urgent threat According to the White House plan to combat   bacteria,   Enterobacteriacea, CRE, is one of the country’s most urgent threats.   states have had at least one type of confirmed CRE case, which are resistant to nearly all antibiotics including   drugs.

"How Mary Tyler Moore changed television.  Mary Tyler Moore died on January 25, leaving behind a rich legacy of television that wouldn’t be the same  —   or possibly exist at all  —   without her influence.     The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which Moore produced with her husband and business partner Grant Tinker, was more than just a TV series. Moore played a single woman with a demanding journalism job  —   a role that, when the show debuted in 1970, stood as a strong rebuke of traditional sitcom gender roles. Mary Richards was single, but she wasn’t a sadsack; she had a career, she was good at her job, she was working hard alongside men. And people took notice.        Related    Mary Tyler Moore’s comedic grace and tremendous talent, in 5 performances  Mary Tyler Moore and its eventual spinoff Rhoda steadily gained millions of viewers, and both series regularly landed in the top 20 shows of the year. Their success forced the TV industry to reconsider how it was telling workplace stories, and how it was casting women characters in general.  Once TV networks had a successful frame of reference for a comedy about women’s lives at both work and home, other shows were freer to explore the same stories on their own terms. And many did: As Friends   Marta Kauffman said when promoting her wildly successful show’s series finale in 2004, Mary Tyler Moore is still “the gold standard” against which TV comedies measure themselves.     Today, if you look back at the past 40 years of television, Moore’s influence is everywhere. Here are just five of the shows that followed The Mary Tyler Moore Show’s example to tell nuanced stories about work families, working   single women, and beloved female friendships.      1) Cheers (1982 —  1993)             Cheers is often (and correctly) credited as TV’s landmark workplace comedy, but it’s no coincidence that it premiered just a few years after Mary Tyler Moore ended.  Modeled after the “sharp workplace sitcom” half of Mary Tyler Moore, Cheers   the concept of its predecessor’s work family, made it the entire show, upped the sexual tension, and pretty much perfected the workplace comedy formula as we know it today.     Cheers even paid tribute to Mary Tyler Moore’s central friendship; if Diane Chambers and Carla Tortelli took a “Which Mary Tyler Show character are you?” quiz, they’d be Mary and Rhoda and it wouldn’t even be close. 2) Murphy Brown (1988 —  1998)             Ten years after Mary Tyler Moore turned off the lights, Murphy Brown  —   about a determined single woman working in journalism  —   essentially picked up where Mary Tyler Moore left off. Candice Bergen’s iconic character was initially viewed as an older, more experienced version of Moore’s Mary Richards, and Murphy Brown was decidedly more jaded than Mary ever was. But her different stage of life and the show’s ’90s setting allowed Murphy Brown to explore issues that many working women found important; Murphy even decided to have a baby without getting married first, a story that might’ve given networks hives just a few years earlier.      “Mary Tyler Moore really opened the door for women not defined by a relationship, for women trying to have a career,” Bergen told the Today Show on Thursday morning. “And it also opened the door for quality television, ’cause the writing was so exceptional and had so much depth and was  . Mary was an icon unlike any other. ” 3) Friends ( )             When CBS picked up Mary Tyler Moore, executives were so unsure about letting a main female character be single that the network refused to let her start the show as a divorced woman. (They settled for Mary moving to Minneapolis after breaking up with her fiancé.)  Fast forward to the ’90s, and Friends  —   which opens with Jennifer Aniston’s Rachel running to the city after leaving her fiancé and features three female stars forging their own careers while having tons of casual sex  —   is one of the biggest shows on television. The CBS executives of yore would no doubt have been appalled at Friends’ pitch. But 20 years after Mary Tyler Moore, audiences were ready and willing (and eager) to play along. 4) 30 Rock (2006 —  2013)            30 Rock is one of the most direct  —   albeit totally weird  —   descendants of Mary Tyler Moore. As Tina Fey told the New York Times in 2007, she and 30 Rock   Robert Carlock specifically looked to Mary Tyler Moore for an example of how to write a comedy “about the relationships in the workplace, but not the making of television so much”;  she also praised it as a “template of a great show. ” (Fey said something similar in 2015 about the inspiration for Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which she says directly follows Mary Tyler Moore’s “girl in the big city” blueprint.) 30 Rock switched up the basic details of Mary Tyler Moore, with Liz Lemon living in New York instead of the Midwest and working on a sketch comedy instead of a news program. (Though making Liz a cable news producer was, in fact, Fey’s original 30 Rock idea.) The show was also generally much more absurd and detached from reality than Mary Tyler Moore ever could’ve dreamed.  But Liz Lemon’s ongoing quest to “have it all!” between her dating life and stressful TV job of balancing fragile egos  —   including that of her gruff older male work husband Jack Donaghy  —   is still about as straightforward a take on Mary Tyler Moore as it gets.    5) Broad City (2014 —  present)             While there are several shows currently on the air that have Mary Tyler Moore in their DNA (see: The Mindy Project’s working woman conceit, Girls lightly mocking its characters trying to “make it after all” in its very first episode) there is maybe no friendship on TV that owes as much to Mary and Rhoda as Comedy Central’s Broad City.  Mary and Rhoda’s exploits as single women in Minneapolis were usually a    routine between Mary’s more reserved nature and Rhoda’s “so what, who cares” attitude, though neither were entirely Odd   caricatures. Broad City’s Abbi and Ilana follow that tradition to a tee: Abbi is a little more cautious than Ilana, who in turn is known for her brazen  .  But their shared defining characteristic is their love for each other, through thick and thin and whatever bizarro turns their lives take. Without Mary and Rhoda, there’d be no Abbi and Ilana.       A true legend. Rest In Peace, Mary Tyler Moore. A photo posted by abbi & ilana (@broadcity) on Jan 25, 2017 at 12:19pm PST    ",-1.0
"NYC’s brand new subway is the most expensive in the world — that’s a problem.  Today, New York City is celebrating the opening of the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway, a project that’s been anticipated for nearly a century and that’s sorely needed to relieve overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue lines and to extend access to some very densely populated neighborhoods. But as exciting as the opening is, phase one is also a very   project encompassing just three stations. The plan is, eventually, to extend it up into East Harlem, and potentially then either go farther south or swing west to provide crosstown subway service across 125th Street.     Any of this would be extremely useful to the city, but it’s far from clear that any of it will ever happen. That’s because even with $1 billion currently allocated in the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s capital budget for phase two of the Second Avenue Subway, it’s still badly short of the $6 billion that’s going to be needed.  New York state has a fair amount of potential financial resources at its disposal and could certainly come up with $6 billion to spend on extending the subway to East Harlem. But that’s naturally going to be a hard sell politically to the vast majority of New York state residents who don’t live in or regularly visit East Harlem. The shame of it is that by the standards of other major world cities, the $1 billion the MTA already has budgeted should be plenty.     Foreign countries manage to build cheaper subways The $6 billion price tag for phase two works out to $2. 2 billion per kilometer. That would make it the world’s most expensive subway project on a   basis, narrowly surpassing phase one of the Second Avenue Subway, which clocked in at “only” $1. 7 billion per kilometer.     Now, building a railroad underneath an old, densely populated urban area is an inherently expensive undertaking. An   “cut and cover” construction method would never fly politically, and you have to deal with the fact that there’s already a whole bunch of infrastructure sitting beneath the ground. But New York is not the only old and dense city that has built subway tunnels recently  —   it’s simply the most expensive. According to transit blogger Alon Levy’s compendium of international subway projects, Berlin’s U55 line cost $250 million per kilometer, Paris’s Metro Line 14 cost $230 million per kilometer, and Copenhagen’s Circle Line cost $260 million per kilometer.     At those prices, the $1 billion the MTA has in pocket would be enough to complete phase two with a few hundred million left to spare.  We could have more nice things if we built affordably In many transit advocacy circles, it’s considered unfashionable to dwell on these questions of  . The important thing, in this view, is simply to make the case for transit and try to get the money. After all, if the United States can squander $1 trillion invading Iraq, then surely we wouldn’t miss the $6 billion.  That’s fine as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go very far.     For starters: It doesn’t get you the $6 billion. Whether or not you think transportation infrastructure deserves more political support or military spending deserves less, the facts are what they are.  More to the point, making it cheaper to launch pointless invasions of   countries wouldn’t be all that useful, since the monetary cost is really the least of the problems with a pointless invasion. By contrast, precisely because subway construction is genuinely useful, it would be good to do more of it. And one good way to build more subways would be to stretch our dollars as far as the French do.  At Parisian prices, the $6 billion the MTA is currently seeking for phase two would be enough money to build 15 miles’ worth of subway. That would permit a drastically more expansive vision of the Second Avenue Subway as a line that originates in the Financial District, runs north to Second Avenue, stretches all the way up to 125th Street, and then bends west to serve as a crosstown line uniting all of Harlem. Not only would this be a much more useful piece of transit service than a small extension to East Harlem, but also precisely because it would be more useful it would command more political support.  And, indeed, this has been Paris’s experience. The city’s greater success in controlling   construction costs doesn’t mean it spends less money than New York  —   it means it spends more. Line 14 is just the first step in an ambitious proposal to spend $25 billion on a   addition of track to the Paris metro, involving four new lines and 68 new stations. If New York could build at those costs, the MTA could be proposing a comparably ambitious plan featuring new lines under Nostrand Avenue and Utica Avenue in Brooklyn, Northern Boulevard in Queens,  and a circumferential Triboro RX line.  But with high costs per kilometer, you can only propose small projects, and small projects have limited constituencies that ultimately constrain funding.  What went wrong with the Second Avenue Subway? Conservatives like to point the finger at labor unions as the villain for any kind of excessive government expense, but obviously France, Germany, and Denmark are all countries that have strong labor unions.     As Justin Fox has written, it’s possible that, paradoxically, the very weakness of American unions contributes to a dysfunctional political economy around infrastructure projects. In a country where the vast majority of workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, there’s little reason for labor as a whole to care one way or another about the size of public sector payrolls. In the United States, where unions are extremely weak overall but strong in coastal state governments and government contractors, there’s good reason for the overall labor movement to be supportive of a   system in which New York uses 25   machine workers for a job that Spain handles with nine.   But as Josh Barro writes, the majority of the Second Avenue Subway’s price tag actually comes from the stations rather than the tunnels. The line is being built unusually deep for a subway tunnel, which doesn’t do much to change the basic logistics of boring a tunnel but does make excavation of station caverns unusually difficult.  This means the MTA could have saved a considerable amount of money by simply settling for smaller stations. The ones it is actually building have   mezzanines  —   effectively adding an entire second story to the station cavern  —   that, while nice to have, are not critical to the stations’ core transportation function. Deep stations in London, for example, simply lack mezzanines, and they work fine even if they feel a bit cramped.  The depth of the line itself is probably a more telling issue. The route along Second Avenue doesn’t cross other subway lines and thus doesn’t strictly need to be at extraordinary depth. But a deep tunnel minimizes conflicts with existing utility infrastructure. To build a shallower tunnel would require a lot of coordination between the MTA, which is a state agency, the city of New York, a bunch of different utility companies with different regulators, and perhaps the state itself. Getting that coordination done would require, in the first instance, direct political engagement and leadership to try to align incentives. But that’s leadership mostly in the sense of appointing technically competent people and listening to what they have to say, not the kind of helicopter grandstanding that leads to projects designed more to generate good photo ops than good transportation outcomes.  After that, it would require iteration and learning. The US city that’s doing the most rail construction these days is Los Angeles, and LA is getting better at it  —   delivering    costs for the United States (though still high compared with continental Europe) and laying out a published document of project management best practices to explain what it’s learned.  Governing well is hard This is a lot of words about one project in one American city, but it does carry a broader lesson.     It’s relatively easy to look at an example of a foreign country that is doing something well  —   whether that’s Germany in using apprenticeships to connect young people to meaningful   work, Finland in supporting new parents, or Paris in building subway tunnels  —   and say that we ought to do it too. Certainly providing people with quality public services costs money, but the United States is a very rich country, and finding the money for something worthwhile is never impossible.  But this kind of discussion too often elides the real practical difficulties in implementing big domestic policies like those, and the ways in which the US system is uniquely bad and inefficient about doing so. Between the Second Avenue Subway, the $10. 2 billion East Side Access tunnel for the LIRR, and the $4 billion World Trade Center PATH station, the New York City region is in fact spending a lot of money on upgrading its mass transit system. The money is simply not going to generate as much transit service as a comparable amount of spending would in Paris or Copenhagen, because New York’s institutions don’t seem up to the task of spending it as effectively. Improving is both possible and desirable, but it would take actual time and skill and effort.  By the same token, while we know now that it’s certainly possible to set up a Healthcare. gov website that works as intended, we also know that on the launch date the Obama administration had not, in fact, built such a website. That embarrassing governance failure undermined the president’s signature policy initiative in serious ways, with crucial   repercussions. And any big ambitious new progressive initiative is potentially vulnerable to this kind of failure. It’s hard to pass a law providing the money to create a new guarantee of universal access to    . But it’s even harder to actually build and manage preschools that deliver high quality education. Until places like New York and California  —   the bluest jurisdictions that are most open to the idea of taxing and spending to improve public services  —   get better at actually delivering those services in a   way, it’s going to be difficult to persuade residents of more skeptical jurisdictions that it makes sense to take the same agenda national.

"A college student got liquid stitches and a bandage at the ER. Then he got a $2,783 bill..  Last summer, Matt Anderson cut his finger on a knife while doing dishes. He’s a college student, and his roommate, a biology major, suggested that he go to the emergency room. He had recently used the same knife to cut raw meat and thought Anderson’s finger might get infected.    Anderson estimates he got to the emergency room around 11 pm. A nurse saw him shortly after midnight and cleaned his wound. A doctor came by a little later to apply liquid stitches to his finger. Anderson went home around 1 am. “I saw a nurse for maybe five to 10 minutes and a doctor for maybe five minutes tops,” he  says.  A few months later, the bills arrived at his parents’ house: $2, 782 in total.     One reason the fees were so high? Because the clock ticked past midnight as Anderson waited to see a doctor,   Emergency Physicians (the doctor group that appears to staff the emergency room) billed his insurance for two days rather than one. The rest of the bill came from Chestnut Hill Hospital, which owns the emergency department.    Neither provider responded to repeated emails and phone calls requesting comment. The hospital bill has gone into collection, as Matt’s father, Todd Anderson, attempts to negotiate for a lower price. Their insurance plan has a $   deductible, which means the family is responsible for the entire thing.    “My son is 19, he’s trying to do everything right and build his credit, and now I’m worried this will go against [him],” Todd says. “He still feels very guilty right now. He told me he has 25 meals on his  card for the semester, and maybe he could use those to get some money to pay for it. ” Many Republican health care plans to replace Obamacare emphasize the role of consumers’ shopping for the best health care deals as a way to rein in health care spending.  “People will tell you Americans won’t shop for health care. We’re the best shoppers in the world,” Rep. Phil Roe ( )   of the GOP Doctors Caucus, says. “We’ll drive across five lanes of interstate to get cheaper gas. I’ve learned how to shop, and people will learn how to do that. ”    The Andersons’ story is a cautionary tale in how difficult it is for patients to shop for care in a health care system that rarely reveals its prices. It shows that significant reforms in price transparency would be absolutely crucial to making such a plan work.  A $2, 782 bill for a   emergency room visit, explained The Anderson family has received two separate bills for Matt’s emergency room trip. One was from the hospital itself, Chestnut Hill Hospital. That one was initially $1, 036, but their health insurer negotiated a discount, bringing the price down to $772.             That first item  —   a $704 charge for a “limited ED visit”  —   appears to be what hospitals typically refer to as a facility fee, essentially the price of walking in the door of an emergency department. Hospitals charge facility fees to cover the cost of keeping an emergency room open at all hours. Hospitals need to be ready “every day of the year, and stand ready to treat whoever walks through our door, be it a gunshot victim or a patient with a stroke,” John Murphy, chief executive of the Western Connecticut Health Network, wrote in defense of his hospital’s $622 facility fee, which Vox reported on previously.  But facility fees can often be quite hefty, as in these cases  —   and rarely provided to patients before they receive medical care. “I called the   clinics in the area after, who said they would have charged $150 or $225 for something like this,” Todd Anderson says. “I wish they would have said, ‘You can get treatment elsewhere,’ [and] explained how much it was going to cost. ”    An extra $873 charge because the clock ticked past midnight The Chestnut Hill Hospital bill was high, but on its own, Todd Anderson says he wouldn’t have been as angry  —   he probably would have paid it and moved on. What baffled him the most was a separate bill his insurance received from   Emergency Physicians, a group the hospital appears to contract with. This group sent the Andersons’ insurance a bill for $1, 746, which includes two $873 fees. Anderson says when he asked   why it was billed twice, the group said it was because the visit stretched over two days. There was the hour between 11 pm and midnight on one day, and the hour between midnight and 1 am on the second day.  The group did not respond to my phone calls, but the claim that   Emergency Physicians filed with the Andersons’ health insurance backs this up.         “I called them and said, ‘You   me for one day, and the hospital already charged me for that day,’” Todd Anderson remembers. “It was a   procedure. That can’t possibly be correct. ” So far, he says, he has had no luck getting the price lowered. Obamacare tackled some problems in the health care system  —   but not this one The Affordable Care Act largely focused on expanding access to coverage, and on that measure, it has been successful. About 20 million more people have health insurance as a result of the health overhaul.    But the law stayed away from any sort of price regulation  —   or even price transparency  —   that would have prevented a situation such as the one the Andersons experienced. These types of bills are still completely legal in the American health care system. This is very different from international hospitals, where how much they can charge for specific procedures is regulated by government. “The ACA did a great many things, but it didn’t do anything with costs,” says Renee Hsia, an expert in emergency medical billing at the University of California San Francisco. “You can imagine the hospital associations lobbying against that. It’s not in their interest to change the system even though it’s dysfunctional. ” High prices are at the core of one of the main critiques of the Affordable Care Act: that the premiums and deductibles are so high. It’s big bills like these that drive up the cost of insurance, encouraging insurers to shift more of the costs onto patients. Recently, some experts have begun to argue that any health care effort from Republicans or Democrats will struggle to succeed if it doesn’t take steps to eliminate bills like these.  “You cannot do this without focusing on price,” Bill Hoagland, who spent decades working for the Senate Budget Committee, said at a recent event hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. “It is the cost issue that drives us crazy. I don’t know how Republicans put together a package that reduces the deficit that doesn’t focus on price. Doctor costs, hospital costs  —   that is where we have to focus our attention. ”   ",-1.0
"ICE isn’t just detaining “bad hombres.” They’re scooping up anyone in their path..  President Donald Trump has promised the only immigrants being deported now that he’s in office are “bad hombres”: convicted criminals, threats to American safety and the national interest.    News reports from across the country are making clear that’s not true. One day, it’s    Daniela Vargas in Jackson, Mississippi, who once was protected from deportation by President Barack Obama’s deferred action program and now could be deported without trial. The next, it’s Romulo   the father of four   children, pulled over and arrested while driving his youngest daughters to school  —   while his    daughter taped the whole thing on her phone. It’s not that people like Vargas,   and other longtime US residents who are being tracked down by ICE agents and provoking local firestorms are “good immigrants” rather than bad ones. It’s that the “good immigrant” “bad immigrant” distinction has never been quite as clear as people may like to believe.    Communities are shocked and outraged when longtime residents with   children and deep community roots are deported. But ICE is pointing to the letter of its policies  —   which dictate that any unauthorized immigrant is vulnerable to deportation, and set further priorities into which all of these cases (and most unauthorized immigrants) fall.     The pleas that immigrants who might seem “bad” on paper are actually “good” are falling on deaf ears. And the arrests of longtime residents have a ripple effect  —   sending a message to communities as a whole that nothing they do can protect them. The executive orders signed by Trump give individual agents enormous discretion to decide which unauthorized immigrants to go after for deportation, and it certainly appears that those decisions are being made by agents on the ground. But some decisions are being made consistently.    Often, ICE is arresting and deporting people they could have gone after under President Obama  —   but, for whatever reason, did not. Often, they’re detaining people simply because they’re already known to ICE agents  —   the   fruit. And often, they’re making decisions that push the boundaries of one of the few   immigration directives still standing, which tries to protect immigrants’ ability to take their children to school or go to church without fear of deportation. This doesn’t mean that immigrants who don’t fit any of these categories are safe. Indeed, part of the point of these arrests is that safety is not a thing that unauthorized immigrants should feel. But when ICE agents have the power to decide who’s deported and who isn’t, the most important question becomes what decisions are being made. ICE is arresting people they could have prioritized under Obama  —   but, for whatever reason, didn’t President Obama never called immigrants “bad hombres,” but his administration justified immigration enforcement the same way Trump is doing now: They were going after immigrants with criminal convictions or who had already been ordered deported, not hardworking people who hadn’t done anything wrong.     Obama often said he was deporting “felons, not families. ” But in practice, the line is never that clear  —   many people with criminal records (or prior deportation orders) still contribute to their communities.             Under Trump, whole communities are being forced to recognize that messiness, as people who could have been deported under the policies that guided Obama’s first term, but weren’t, are being rounded up. Roman   of Sandy, Oregon, was arrested by ICE agents on Valentine’s Day, on the way to his job at a plant nursery. (He’s currently in immigration detention.) The arrest happened so suddenly that he left his car on the side of the road with the lights on; his wife had to have a neighbor hire a tow truck to pick it up.   has been living in the US since 2001, and has five   children (the youngest of whom is 6 years old).  He doesn’t have a criminal record. But according to his lawyer, he was ordered deported in 1994 (when he was in the US as a migrant worker). That theoretically could have qualified him as a deportation “priority” under the Obama administration  —   he simply wasn’t. In 2008, he was arrested but released by ICE agents after they determined he wasn’t the man they were looking for.  Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco of West Frankfort, Illinois, was arrested by ICE agents near his home. Carlos, as he’s known to the people of West Frankfort (a community profiled in the New York Times this week) manages the Mexican restaurant La Fiesta; neighbors know him as a stalwart supporter of law enforcement (the sort of man who brings meals for firefighters to the site of a fire) and a philanthropist who once raised hundreds of dollars to pay for a local child’s hearing aid.  But Hernandez, who’s been in the US since the “late 1990s” (according to neighbors) has two drunk driving convictions on his record from 2007  —   making him a convicted criminal who could have been targeted during the first six years of the Obama administration. He wasn’t  —   but within the first six weeks of the Trump era, his status as a “convicted criminal” put him in ICE’s crosshairs. Hernandez has been released on bail while his deportation case is pending.    Obviously, saying that someone could have been deported under Obama only goes so far  —   for whatever reason, they weren’t. But going after someone like Hernandez, who has a criminal record, makes it easier for ICE to offer statistics showing it really is rounding up “criminal immigrants” as Trump promised to do before taking office. It may also be a simple matter of availability. Immigrants who have criminal records or deportation orders are already known to federal agents; their names are in DHS databases. ICE may simply be going after the people it can already track down. ICE is scooping up anyone who comes across its path Deciding who to deport is really a question of resource allocation. The Obama administration spent a lot of time trying to encourage agents (with mixed results) to spend their time tracking down serious criminals, even if that took longer  —   and ultimately meant deporting fewer people  —   than just detaining every unauthorized immigrant they found. Now that Trump has “taken the handcuffs off” ICE agents, it’s not surprising that they’re scooping up the immigrants they can already find  —   or even the ones coming to them: Jose Escobar of Houston, Texas, was arrested February 22 when he went to an ICE office for a   with agents. ICE detained Escobar, the    father of two   children, in 2012. But when local media brought attention to his case, the government released him  —   and gave him protection from deportation and a work permit.  As part of that arrangement, Escobar had to meet with ICE agents annually; when he went in to do so in 2017, he was stripped of protections and arrested. Escobar was deported to El Salvador on March 2  —   a country he hadn’t seen since he left for the US in 2001, at the age of 15. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos of Phoenix, Arizona, was detained when she went in for her annual ICE   on February 8, and deported to Mexico the next morning. Garcia de Rayos had also received a reprieve from deportation in 2013, though she had both a criminal conviction (for using a fake Social Security number to work) and a previous deportation order. She’d lived in the US for more than 20 years, since she was 14. Her husband and two   children are still living in Phoenix, but their mother is gone.      Dani was taken by ICE just days after they took 55 people in a mass raid. We stand   @mirastruggle, Dani & all who were taken.  #HeretoStay pic. twitter.  —   We Belong Together (@WomenBelong) March 2, 2017    Daniela Vargas of Jackson, Mississippi, was arrested when ICE raided her home in early February. But while her father and brother were taken by ICE agents, Vargas, a    who hoped to go back to school and become a math teacher, was initially released. It may have been because Vargas fits the criteria for protection from deportation under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Removals program  —   though she’d lost her protection last fall when she couldn’t pay the renewal fees.  After she spoke out at a March 1 press conference about her father’s and brother’s arrests, however, the car she was riding in was pulled over and ICE agents arrested Vargas again  —   and then slotted her to be deported without a hearing. Since Vargas came to the US from Argentina (at the age of 7) under a program that allowed people to come for 90 days without visas, then overstayed, she’s eligible for immediate deportation.  The circumstances of Vargas’s arrest have led advocates, including the ACLU, to allege that ICE retaliated against her for speaking out. Even if that is untrue, the fact that this is the message being taken from her arrest is going to have a chilling effect on immigrants’ willingness to speak up in future.  ICE still isn’t supposed to be in schools or churches. But they’re pushing the envelope. Taken to its logical conclusion, the desire to send a message to whole immigrant communities leads ICE agents to the places where immigrants are likely to congregate: the schools where they drop off their children, the churches they attend on Sundays, or the courthouses where they may be appearing to pick up restraining orders or testify as crime witnesses. The government has decided that message is too powerful  —   that sending a message to unauthorized immigrants isn’t worth the cost of scaring people out of taking their children to school, or provoking criticism from religious groups for targeting churchgoers. In 2011, the Obama administration issued a memo preventing ICE from conducting enforcement activity at “sensitive locations. ” And while the Trump administration has gotten rid of most of Obama’s policies that limit ICE agents, it let that one stand. But ICE agents are certainly pushing up against the boundaries of the “sensitive locations” restriction. And if ICE can’t go into these locations, but can pick up immigrants on the way there or back, it might serve the same purpose after all.     Romulo   of Highland Park, California, was pulled over and arrested by ICE agents on February 28 as he took his    daughter to school. The    who was still in the car (along with  ’s wife) recorded the arrest on her phone; her cries are audible on the recording.    is 48 years old and has been in the US for more than 20 years. He works at a Mexican restaurant and all four of his children (the youngest of whom is 12) were born in the United States. He also has a   DUI conviction, which may have been the reason ICE targeted him  —   but while they had followed   since he left the house that morning, they chose to pull him over a block from his daughter’s school. Irvin Gonzalez of El Paso, Texas, was arrested inside an El Paso county courthouse on February 9. Gonzalez, a transgender woman who cleans houses and teaches Zumba classes, has a significant criminal record  —   but she was at the courthouse to file a restraining order against an abusive partner. ICE agents initially claimed they arrested Gonzalez outside the courthouse, but video footage showed they arrested her inside it.  Courthouses were included as “sensitive locations” under the Obama administration  —   precisely because of the fear that   victims of domestic violence, and other crime victims, would be afraid to show up in court  —   but they’ve quietly been exempted from the policy on the ICE website. Gonzalez is currently being held in immigration detention without bail and is facing federal charges for participating in a   laundering scheme. The “good   immigrant” dichotomy isn’t new  —   but the weighting has changed What distinguishes the Trump administration’s approach to detaining these immigrants, more than anything, is that the community and public outcry their arrests have engendered hasn’t caused ICE to reevaluate whether they should be deported after all. Under Obama, immigrants who clearly had deep roots in their communities, and whose arrests sparked local backlash were often released  —   sometimes with official protection, as Jose Escobar of Houston got in 2012. You can see this as the Obama administration being averse to bad press. Or you can see it as a way of ensuring that immigrants who were contributing to their communities were spared from deportation, even if they qualified on paper as priorities thanks to old criminal convictions or deportation orders. It was a way of allowing “bad” immigrants to prove themselves to be “good” ones.    That’s not happening under Trump.  There is some hope that local support for immigrants might protect them in at least some cases  —   Carlos Hernandez of Illinois, for example, was released on bond after an immigration judge was impressed by the letters of support Hernandez got from neighbors and community leaders. But he’s still fighting a deportation case. The public might feel that Hernandez, and so many others like him, are really “good” immigrants  —   but the administration does not. ",-1.0
"The Alternate Universe Where Facebook Bought Twitter. Hi, it’s Steven again, still on book tour but now back to newslettering. It’s been two weeks since you’ve heard me say that, at first, this weekly column—which has had its hands washed for 20 seconds before sending!—will be free for everyone to access. Eventually, only WIRED subscribers will get Plaintext as a newsletter. You’ll get to keep reading it in your inbox by subscribing to WIRED (discounted 50%), and in the process getting all our amazing tech coverage in print and online. Two things everyone wants to avoid are Covid-19 and activist investor Paul Singer trying to take over your company so he can fire you. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has crafted a plan to deal with Threat One—he has encouraged employees to work from home—but it’s unclear what he’s going to do with Threat Two, as Singer has accumulated a significant share of Twitter and wants Dorsey out. Singer does make the point that, under Dorsey, Twitter’s stock price and growth has underperformed, and that Twitter might benefit from a full-time CEO, instead of one who splits time between two public companies (Twitter and Square) and a possible months-long vision quest to Africa to ponder cryptocurrencies. In light of this crisis in the Twitterverse, I began to wonder what things might have been like if a fateful decision in 2008 went the other way. That was when Facebook tried to buy Twitter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg had not yet perfected his skills at breaking the will of founders who wanted to stay independent; Evan Williams, Twitter’s CEO at the time, advised his board to turn down the $500 million offer, even though the sum was twice the current valuation. But what if the board had taken the cash? Here’s my version of this counterhistory. First of all, Williams would have left right away. He is not a fan of Zuckerberg, and would not have wanted to replay his unhappy experience at Google, in which he’d sold an early company to the giant and was then unable to execute his vision for it. Facebook-owned Twitter would replace him with … Jack Dorsey. Around that time, in real life, Facebook executive Chris Cox had been meeting in coffee shops with Dorsey, who had just been exiled from Twitter. Cox wanted to hire Dorsey. So what better choice to run this fictional acquisition than the guy who thought up the idea in the first place? The Twitter buy would have had an impact on Facebook’s News Feed also. In real life, after the rejected offer, Facebook tried to copy a number of Twitter’s features, including a real-time urgency and an increased viral pulse. That would not have been necessary if Facebook owned Twitter. Maybe the News Feed would not have courted so much of the toxicity it became known for later on. The big impact for Facebook, though, would have been a massive data merger of the databases of both companies. As it would later do with WhatsApp, Facebook undoubtedly would have integrated the profile information between the two apps, much to the consternation of privacy advocates. In addition to all the likes, shared interests, and other data from its Blue app, one’s dossier would have included Twitter behavior—whom you follow, what you shared, what tweets you clicked on. This would have reaped bigger profits, making ads on Facebook a little better, but really supercharging the ads on Twitter, as the combined information would have allowed for precision targeting of sponsored tweets. Facebook would also have used its growth acumen to drive up Twitter’s membership, as it has done with Instagram and WhatsApp. The 330 million or so users on Twitter now are chicken feed for Facebook. In our alternate universe, at least a billion users all over the world might have ended up on Twitter. If Facebook had owned  Twitter in addition to Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, it would have ended up even more powerful—and profitable—than it is now. On the other hand, it probably would have added to Facebook’s woes in the aftermath of the election, as the social conglomerate would have become a one-stop shop for disinformation. (One thing Facebook and Twitter share: Both allow Donald Trump to say anything he cares to, even if it violates content policy. He could cross-post!) As time went on, Dorsey would have eventually joined his fellow founders in the Facebook sphere in feeling disempowered and betrayed. Eventually, he would have resigned, just as the others did. Meanwhile, regulators, legislators, and attorneys general would be calling to break off Twitter from Facebook—as they are demanding with WhatsApp and Instagram. If that happened, Twitter might be independent once more. Dorsey, fresh from a meditation retreat in Botswana, would reassume leadership and return Twitter to what it once was—quirky, underperforming, and less of a worry than Facebook is. With one exception. In my counterhistory, Twitter would have adopted a feature beloved by anyone who has ever posted on Facebook’s News Feed. Yes, if Facebook had bought Twitter, we’d be able to edit our tweets. Or so goes my dream. In real life, Dorsey’s exile from Twitter ended in March 2011, when then-CEO Dick Costolo brought him back both for his design savvy and, as he puts it, a “sincere appreciation for the vision of the founder.” That’s when Dorsey’s double-tracking—reviled by outside investor Singer—began. He addressed this in interviews I conducted with him for a 2012 profile in WIRED: Dorsey splits his time between the two companies. “It’s unusual, but the companies have a lot of parallels,” he says. “They’re both utilities. They both can be used by a dynamic range—from individuals to the largest organizations in the world. They both have social aspects; payments are just another form of communication. Both are exchanges of value.” Some have criticized Dorsey’s dual role, arguing that he is spreading himself thin. “I will do whatever it takes to make sure both succeed,” Dorsey insists. “It’s like two family members you care for and love deeply.” Louis writes, “Lately Microsoft, Adobe, Quicken, and other producers of programs I use to organize my life are issuing updates that A. Make their software less stable B. Take away features that are hardwired into my fingers and C. Try to force me to ‘subscribe’ to use software online (and depend on internet access to use it) instead of on my laptop where I can continue to work even if the power goes down. How do we fight back against soulless corporate profiteering taking unfair advantage of our addiction to the old familiar software we depend on to run our lives?” Louis, you are right. Companies like Microsoft found themselves at a disadvantage when Google and others began offering productivity software for free. And cloud-based software is increasingly dominant. So they moved to subscriptions, which turned out to be more profitable than trying to convince their customers to buy upgrades. I also agree that those companies are insensitive to the frequent times that we users are offline. So how do you fight back? You break your addiction and use alternatives. Smaller and friendlier companies have created apps just for people in your situation. (They almost always let you import your existing files.) I broke my Microsoft Word habit by using Scrivener to write my book. For under $50 I got a tool that was far superior than Word for my purposes, with imaginative features that I now can’t live without. So, Louis, swallow hard and move to something newer. You have nothing to lose but your chains. You can submit questions to mail@wired.com. Write ASK LEVY in the subject line. Between the virus, the tornado, and, well, politics, I don’t think I can pick out just one this week. Sorry. Apparently a lot of people want to dress just like the Twitch-masters who sit behind consoles to compete in pro-gaming contests. Fashion companies have noticed. It’s also been a big week for Alphabet’s autonomous car venture, Waymo: It’s got a fleet of Jaguars, and also $2.5 billion in venture funding. And in personal Last But Not Least news, I ended a 20-plus year drought in Fresh Air appearances. You can also catch me on this week's Gadget Lab Podcast. That’s it for this week.

"Here’s how El Niño and global warming helped 2015 shatter temperature records.  Update the record books: 2015 was the hottest year on Earth since we first started keeping track, thanks to the combination of global warming and a powerful El Niño.    No other year has even come close:            The declaration comes from two separate analyses released today by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) finding that 2015 was the hottest year globally since records first began in 1880. NASA says this past year was a full 0. 9°C (1. 62°F) hotter than the   average, and 0. 13°C (0. 23°F) hotter than 2014, the previous  . El Niño is part of the story, but only a part. .. So how did this happen? Two things. First,  an extraordinarily strong El Niño has been unfolding in the Pacific Ocean. El Niños are periodic phenomena that occur when the trade winds that typically blow east to west in the tropics start to weaken. That ends up disrupting weather patterns all around the world. It also causes some of the heat that was stored in deeper layers of the ocean to rise to the surface, bumping up global temperatures. (See here for our explainer on how El Niño works.)    This year’s El Niño was one of the strongest ever seen, reaching its maximum this winter. You can see its telltale signs below: the area in the east tropical Pacific hit record highs this year.               Still, El Niño can’t be the only thing going on. After all, El Niños recur periodically  —   most recently, there was a massive one in  ’98. But 2015 was much hotter than 1998. The other big story, of course, is global warming.    Global warming is the other big factor: Even El Niño years keep getting hotter            The basics of global warming are now familiar to most people. As we burn fossil fuels and add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, we steadily trap more heat on the Earth’s surface. What’s less   is that more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans. So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can cause fluctuations from year to year. When a strong El Niño forms, more of that heat is transferred up to the surface, warming things up a bit. By contrast, when those Pacific trade winds strengthen and a La Niña forms, more of that heat is trapped below the ocean surface, cooling things down a bit. This cycle can lead to ups and downs over time.    But as we emit more and more CO2, we keep trapping more heat overall. As the chart above shows, El Niño years are getting hotter over time. La Niña years are getting hotter. Normal years are getting hotter. The overall trend is . .. hotter. By the way, scientists tend to think that El Niño has its biggest effect on global surface temperatures three months after peaking. So it’s quite possible that 2016 could see a big surge in heat as well. We’ll have to wait and see. ”If you were going to be betting, it’s likely 2016 will be warmer than 2015,” said NOAA’s Thomas Karl at a press conference. Similarly, it’s entirely likely that the rate of warming will slow again once El Niño ends and La Niña conditions return to the Pacific. Not every future year will set records. But it’s a good bet that records will keep recurring. One lesson here is to not get too caught up in any specific year or single record. El Niño events, other ocean fluctuations, volcanoes, and even cyclical solar activity can cause blips from year to year. The thing to watch is the   trend, which is ultimately getting warmer. How hot it ultimately gets is unclear  —   it depends, to a large extent, on how much CO2 we keep putting into the atmosphere.

"John Oliver is preparing to take on President Trump, but he isn’t exactly excited about it.      John Oliver’s HBO show “Last Week Tonight” returns to HBO on Sunday, but he has been surprisingly okay with staying off the air for almost three months. “Until Inauguration Day nothing was really happening,” Oliver told Stephen Colbert during an appearance on “The Late Show” Tuesday. “It was just being tied to a train track, watching the train coming. And then of course Inauguration Day is the train hitting you and you thinking, yep that felt pretty much how I thought it was going to feel. ” “Last Week Tonight” has been on hiatus since November, when Oliver railed against the election of President Trump and lit a visual representation of 2016 on fire. In the meantime, his fellow   comedians have kept close watch on Trump’s first days in office  —   skewering his inauguration ceremony and a slew of executive orders, including a controversial immigration ban on refugees and immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries.    On “Late Night,” Oliver said that Inauguration Day “felt like 114 years ago. ” “We have a long way to go. It’s gonna be hard. It’s easy to be angry on adrenaline, but it is much, much harder when you’re tired. And this is going to be exhausting,” he said. Colbert showed his audience a copy of the current issue of Rolling Stone, which depicts a frustrated Oliver on the cover. He then pulled out a copy of Time bearing the face of White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon. “Does this fill you with any feelings?” Colbert asked. The audience booed. “Okay, it’s not wrestling,” Oliver joked.      John Oliver appears on our new cover. Head to RollingStone. com to read the story with the ’Last Week Tonight’ host in full. In the new interview, Oliver talks candidly about crafting comedy in dark times, that ”Drumpf” gag and where we go from here. Photograph by Mark Seliger (@markseliger) A photo posted by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone) on Feb 7, 2017 at 7:32am PST    Colbert reminded him that Bannon’s boss (as in, Trump) is in the WWE Hall of Fame. “Is he? You’re right. Why wouldn’t he be?” Oliver said. As for Bannon, Oliver called him “a terrifying individual. ” He added that he was particularly disheartened by the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. “I actually think she might and should serve as an inspiration to school kids in America because she shows that they could be secretary of education one day. In fact, not just one day  —   now,” he joked. “They could do it now. They’re about as well qualified now as she is. They’ve spent arguably longer in a public school. ” Colbert also asked Oliver whether he was scared about being deported to his native England. Oliver has a green card, but is not an American citizen. “The crazy thing is it’s probably not gonna happen, but there is a nonzero chance of it happening now. So yeah, I am slightly concerned. ”      President Trump’s controversial pick for secretary of education was officially confirmed after a historically tight vote.   comedians John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and others weighed in. (The Washington Post)   “Having a green card used to be enough,” he continued. “And yet what we saw with that executive order on immigration, that debacle, things are not what they’re supposed to be. We held up translators  —   Afghan and Iraqi translators  —   at the border who have bled for a country they’ve never visited, have sacrificed family members for this country. This president has done neither of these things, so it’s a little hard to swallow him telling people whether they should be a benefit to America or not. ” Though Oliver clearly has a lot to say about Trump’s first few weeks in office, he has also said that he isn’t going to devote all of “Last Week Tonight” to the president. “It’s a lot of people feeding on the same carcass,” he told the New York Times in an interview this week. “We try to pick a different carcass because of how many different beaks have already gotten to it. ” Related: John Oliver literally lights 2016 on fire: ‘Let’s all try harder next year’",-0.5
"Chief custodian bragged about school violations on Instagram. Brooklyn school custodian Nick Pascale fiddles while PS 297 could potentially burn. FDNY inspectors slapped Pascale with six   violations on March 1  —   including three for storing equipment filled with combustible fuel inside the   school. It’s a serious safety breach, experts said, because fumes from   equipment such as   or   can ignite and start a fire. But Pascale, the chief custodian responsible for   the building, made light of the hazards by showing off the stack of citations on his Instagram page March 1 with the breezy comment, “Just one of those days. ” He added five hashtags including “#Custodian problems. ” His followers added comments such as “Yikes! ,” “Damn,” and “That looks like a lot of violations, mr. custodian. ” Parents at the   school were not amused. “That’s playing with my daughter’s life,” said Nikkie Lopez, whose child is in fourth grade. Pascale’s Instagram page displayed other photos taken inside the school. One showed him, with another man, riding a bike down a hallway  —   apparently after hours. Another showed him propping his feet up on a desk: “My #View for the next two days. . . #SnowMoney #OT #CustodianLife #NYC #DeptofEd #Blizzard of 2016. ” Other photos poked fun at an empty toilet paper roll and a damaged classroom piano. “That’s somebody everybody trusts goofing around and not taking it seriously,” said Crystal Jacobs, whose    daughter Jade is in  . “Ha ha, real funny. ” Pascale, whose job title is   took down his Instagram page while The Post was viewing it. He did not return messages. Principal James Brown refused to speak with a reporter. Toya Holness, a city Department of Education spokeswoman, said the three other violations were for “excessive decorations,” a fire hazard; faulty or missing emergency lighting (  lights used in a power outage); and failing to display a certificate assuring that curtains, drapes and other hangings are  . “Safety comes first and we are treating this with the utmost seriousness  —   a majority of the violations have already been addressed and the school has taken immediate steps to resolve the remaining violations,” Holness said. As for Pascale’s   antics, Holness said, “We’re looking into it and will ensure it’s appropriately addressed. ” But a source remarked, “Maybe spending less time on Instagram and more time making sure the school is safe would be a good idea. ” Pascale, who joined the DOE last August, worked at PS 8 in Staten Island before moving to PS 297 in November, officials said. His base salary is $72, 620. But the job can afford plenty of overtime opportunities, due to contracted work rules. School   make an average of $140, 000 a year, including OT, said Tim Hoefer, executive director of the Empire Center, a watchdog group that collects government payroll data.​",1.0
"New push to replace Obamacare reignites old GOP tensions.  Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama’s signature   law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before   Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law’s insurance would go away.   are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast. While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years. “I’d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( ) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the “repeal and replace” efforts. “We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats won’t help with anything. ”   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. 3. (Jonathan  )  Hatch and other   Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until 2019 or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections. Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins ( ) have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly. “I don’t want to leave the 84, 000 people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden,   of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy,” Collins said. But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues  —   many of them sent to Congress in the midterm,   waves of 2010 and 2014  —   who see little reason to dawdle. “The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that it’ll never get done,” said Rep. Mark Meadows ( . C.) elected recently as the new chairman of the   House Freedom Caucus. “Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years?” Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their   is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a “terrific” replacement that will provide “great health care at a fraction of the cost. ”  The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare’s sunset. But other fights loom  —   over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition. The battle lines, however, are familiar, with “establishment” Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner ( ) to retire. Come Jan. 20, Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a   overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. 3. But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets. So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute. “We’re going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel,” Vice   Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. “The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people. ”   on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price ( .) Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill “with all deliberate speed” but pledged only to then “set into motion a process to replace it. ” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said Thursday that Republicans would move “as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people. ” Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing. “The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace,” he said. Conservative activists who pushed a    approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited. “When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you don’t wait,” said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. “I’m a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. That’s it. ” Democrats and many   experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than 12 million Americans are covered under those policies. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare’s insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the   meeting. “Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states,” Burwell told reporters after the meeting. Republicans want to end Obamacare’s system of penalties and subsidies. But many  —   including Trump  —   want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick. Experts warn that “repeal and delay” under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as $3 billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated. “That $3 billion is the tip of the iceberg,” Blumberg said. “With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get. ” Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers. “The insurance industry should understand that there’s a new sheriff in town,” said Rep. Ken Buck ( .) a Freedom Caucus member. “They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, they’re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a   insurance industry. ” The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic. There will be a slim    Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require 60 votes. Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan  —   and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so.  “We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all,” Hatch said. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) however, has rejected that strategy. “We’re not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,” he told The Washington Post recently. But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and   activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction. One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin,   of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the    efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to 11, 000 congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law. “I don’t think anyone thinks that you’re going to flip a switch . . . but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly,” she said. “We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done. ” Brandon was even blunter: “This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough [cookies],” he said. “They’re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? It’s hard. “The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place,” he added. “The old excuses of having divided government, they’re gone. ” A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. “They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully they’ll recognize that it’s not quite so simple,” said Sen. Ron Johnson ( .) who was first elected in the 2010 tea party wave. But many others are not. “Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress,” said Rep. Mark Walker ( . C.) a   who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. “We’ve got to act on it. ”  John Wagner and Amy Goldstein contributed to this report. ",-0.5

"Nintendo Switch Lite: Our Hands-On First Impressions . What is the definitive Nintendo handheld? Ask around and you'll get a different answer each time. For me, the Nintendo DS Lite remains king, in all its stylish, small, sturdy-as-hell glory. It was the perfect pocket-sized revision to the chunky DS that allowed me to sneak Sonic Rush into my elementary-school math classes and zip around, collecting emeralds instead of learning my multiplication tables. With the Nintendo Switch Lite, Nintendo is hoping to snag a new generation of kids with a slightly more backpack-ready version of its popular Switch console. Sure, the smaller size sets the Switch Lite apart from its larger Switch cousin, but the aside from that, the key differentiating feature is your television. The standard Switch is a hybrid game console that can work as a handheld machine, or can be slid into a dock so you can play games on your TV screen. The Lite is mobile-only and does not connect to a big screen. It doesn’t have removable controllers on its side, either. (Read our guide for more on the differences.) Despite its inability to broadcast to a TV, the Lite can still play most Switch games that support portable mode. I had the opportunity to try out Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at Nintendo’s ritzy Switch Lite hands-on event in New York City. (And I do mean ritzy; they served hummus in glass jars.) Both games ran well and I walked away quite impressed. Frame rates were steady and the Lite’s 720p screen was as vibrant and crisp as the regular Switch. It played like a Switch in portable mode. Not having detachable Joy-Cons felt strange, though. Since the controllers for the Lite are baked into the hardware, you can't pop them off the sides of the screen. It made the Lite feel a lot like Nintendo’s old Wii U gamepad—the cumbersome, bulky progenitor of the Switch family. The Lite is definitely a lot slimmer than that gamepad, but holding it feels similar. Note: When you buy something using the retail links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Read more about how this works. The lack of detachable Joy-Cons has another side effect: The Lite can't natively play games that require motion controls. You can link extra Joy-Cons to the Lite to remedy this, but you'll need to buy them (and a Joy-Con charger) separately. These Switch accessories will set you back nearly $100. Add on the $200 you're paying for a Switch Lite, and you're back up to the standard Switch's $300 price tag, but without the ability to connect to a TV. To complicate things more, Nintendo also just released a new model of the standard Switch that has longer battery life than the Lite. In many ways, the standard Switch is a smarter investment. So I asked Nintendo: Why buy a Lite? Nintendo's manager of product marketing JC Rodrigo and assistant manager of public relations David Young both had a simple answer to that question: It's a choice. A lot of companies use the word ""choice"" as a piece of disposable PR jargon, but in this instance, Rodrigo and Young were onto something. They said the Lite would be a smart pick for people who only want the Switch as a handheld, for families who already own a standard Switch but have more than one person eager to take it out of the house, and for entry-level gamers who aren't ready to buy the full flagship console. The Switch Lite isn't meant to be an optimal choice when compared with the standard Switch, but it could be the best personal choice depending on your circumstances, they argue. In my mind, it doesn't make much sense to spend $200 on a Lite when you could put down an extra $100 for more versatile, superior hardware, but Rodrigo's and Young's statements did make me think about the kids out there stockpiling allowance money. That $100 in savings could make the difference in whether they can get a Switch at all this year. It would've for me, back when I was young enough to think shoveling snow off my neighbors' sidewalks was the peak of gainful employment. It does seem like the smaller and slimmer Lite is designed with kids in mind, especially when you look at the system's color options: yellow, turquoise, and gray. I would love to see how younger kids reacted to the Lite, free from my very adult concerns about the system's overall value. The hands-on event had waiters serving miniature ice cream sandwiches, but the best I could do was pretend to be a kid again. Doing so did make me wonder how much punishment the Lite can endure—a question every wise parent will ask before buying—though it's likely stronger and sturdier than it felt. It takes time to adjust to the fact the Lite isn't a palm-sized brick like the DS and 3DS. It's a skinny two-handed tablet with thumb sticks poking out and an exposed screen. Despite the marketing talk, I couldn't believe Nintendo would leave out the ability to “switch” to a TV from the Switch Lite entirely. I asked a couple Nintendo employees at the event if there was a chance it would be dockable in the future. They all refused to say no, but said the same thing: The Lite is a portable experience. Nintendo could release a Lite TV adapter cord or dock in the not-so-distant future. It just doesn’t want to talk about that possibility now. There are a lot of amazing games for the Switch, and many reasons you might want to save 100 smackaroos and opt for a Switch Lite. It's a good handheld choice for many, and may be the only choice for some. I don’t know if the Switch Lite will become my favorite handheld system ever, but it may earn that crown from a new generation of kids when it hits shelves September 20.",0.0
"How the opioid epidemic became America’s worst drug crisis ever, in 15 maps and charts.  America is in the middle of its deadliest drug crisis ever.    With all the other news going on, it can be easy to lose track of this fact. But it’s true: In 2015, more than 52, 000 people died of drug overdoses, nearly   of which were linked to opioids like Percocet, OxyContin, heroin, and fentanyl. That’s more drug overdose deaths than any other period in US history  —   even more than past heroin epidemics, the crack epidemic, or the recent meth epidemic. And the preliminary data we have from 2016 suggests that the epidemic may have gotten worse since 2015. This situation did not develop overnight, but it has quickly become one of the biggest public health crises facing America. To understand how and why, I’ve put together a series of maps and charts that show the key elements of the epidemic  —   from its start through legal painkillers prescribed in droves by doctors to the recent rise of the highly potent opioid fentanyl. 1) Drug overdoses now kill more people than gun homicides and car crashes combined    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   To understand just how bad the opioid epidemic has gotten, consider these statistics: Drug overdoses in 2015 were linked to more deaths than car crashes or guns, and in fact killed more people than car crashes and gun homicides combined. Drug overdoses in 2015 also killed more people in the US than   did during its peak in 1995. So just as   lives in the American mind as a horrible epidemic, the current opioid epidemic should too.    2) Drug, painkiller, heroin, and other opioid overdose deaths are still on the rise    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   It took years of increasing deaths to get to this point, but the opioid epidemic has only gotten worse over time. The result is horrifying: Between 1999 and 2015, more than 560, 000 people in the US died to drug overdoses  —   a death toll larger than the entire population of Atlanta.    The epidemic has by and large been caused by the rise in opioid overdose deaths. First, opioid painkiller overdoses began to rise, as doctors began to fill out a record number of prescriptions for the drugs in an attempt to treat patients’ pain conditions. Then, people hooked on painkillers began to move over to heroin as they or their sources of drugs lost their prescriptions. And recently, more people have begun moving to fentanyl, an opioid that’s even more potent and cheaper than heroin. The result is a deadly epidemic that so far shows no signs of slowing down. 3) Opioid overdoses are one reason US life expectancy declined for the first time in decades         In 2015, US life expectancy dropped for the first time in decades. There are many causes behind the drop, including rising rates of diabetes, obesity, and suicide. But a big reason for the decrease was the rise in alcohol poisonings and drug overdoses.    4) The epidemic is much worse in some states than others      (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   Not every state in America has been equally impacted by the opioid epidemic. States like West Virginia, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Ohio have been hit particularly hard, suffering far more deaths than even their neighbors on an annual basis. And the epidemic has generally been concentrated along the Rust Belt and New England  —   due in large part, it seems, to the enormous number of painkiller prescriptions that doctors doled out in those areas. 5) By and large, the drug overdose epidemic has hit white Americans the hardest         The drug overdose epidemic hasn’t hit people of all racial groups equally either, with white Americans suffering far more overdose deaths than their black and Latino peers. As the chart above shows, this is a shift from before the 2000s, when past drug crises tended to hit black, urban communities much harder. One reason for the disparity may, ironically, be racism against nonwhite Americans. Studies show that doctors are more reluctant to prescribe painkillers to minorities, because doctors mistakenly believe that minority patients feel less pain or are more likely to misuse and sell the drugs. In a perverse way, this shielded minority patients from the tsunami of opioid painkiller prescriptions that got white Americans hooked on opioids and led to a wave of deadly overdoses.    6) Americans consume more opioids than any other country         This is perhaps the most important chart to understand why America in particular is suffering from the epidemic: Simply put, the US consumes far more opioid painkillers than any other country in the world. When a country collectively consumes more of a deadly, addictive drug, it’s obviously going to have more deaths as a result of those drugs. 7) In some states, doctors have filled out more painkiller prescriptions than there are people            So why do Americans consume so many opioids? In short, it’s because doctors have prescribed a lot of them. Starting in the 1980s and ’90s, doctors were under pressure to take pain more seriously. There was some good reason for that: About 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain, according to a 2011 report from the Institute of Medicine. So doctors  —   under pressure from drug companies, medical organizations, government agencies, and pain patient advocates  —   resorted to opioids. The result: In 2012, US physicians wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers  —   enough to give a bottle of pills to every adult in the country. And these pills didn’t just end up in patients’ hands; they also proliferated to black markets, were shared among friends and family, landed in the hands of teens who rummaged through parents’ medicine cabinets, and so on. 8) Drug companies have made a lot of money from opioids            One of the undeniable contributors to the opioid epidemic is drug companies. Seeing the demand for doctors to take pain more seriously, drug companies pitched newer products like OxyContin as the big medical solution. The marketing was extremely misleading, often presenting these drugs as safer and more effective than other painkillers and opioids on the market  —   when these drugs were in fact extremely addictive and dangerous. Ultimately, some drug companies would pay for their misleading marketing. Purdue Pharma, producer of OxyContin, in 2007 paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for its false claims. And Purdue and other opioid producers remain in legal battles over the drugs to this day. 9) At the same time, Americans report greater levels of pain         Despite the increase in painkiller prescriptions, studies show that Americans generally report higher levels of chronic pain than they did before the epidemic started.    This gets to a crucial point in the opioid epidemic: Despite drug companies’ marketing, opioid painkillers may not be an effective treatment for chronic pain. There’s simply no good scientific evidence that opioid painkillers can actually treat   chronic pain as patients grow tolerant of opioids’ effects, but there’s plenty of evidence that prolonged use can result in very bad complications, including a higher risk of addiction, overdose, and death. Yet painkillers, due to how they work, can actually trick patients into believing that the drugs are effective for chronic pain. As Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke, author of Drug Dealer, MD, recently explained: It’s absolutely true that if you were to get opioids for your pain, it would be like a magical cure for about a month or maybe two. But after a while, there’s a very high likelihood that they would stop working. And then you would have two problems: You would have your pain, and you would be dependent on this drug and experience painful withdrawal if you try to get off [opioids]. So after prolonged use, some patients who try to stop taking opioids will feel a sudden surge of pain. They’ll likely think the pain they’re feeling is their chronic pain coming back in full force now that the painkillers are gone. In reality, the opioids have likely stopped working on the original chronic pain due to tolerance, and the surge of pain is an entirely new pain from drug dependence withdrawal. Only by slowly weaning themselves off opioids can they permanently stop this new   pain. There’s also evidence that opioids can make pain worse. Opioids might make people more sensitive to pain. They might weaken the bones, leading to painful fractures. And they might get people to behave in ways that expose them to greater injury, which of course would lead to far more pain. Lembke gave an example of someone popping extra pills to let them do more yard work: “If you take additional opioids, you can’t hear the signals from your body about what you shouldn’t be doing, and then maybe you’re going to do some   damage above what’s already been done. ”    10) Painkillers are often prescribed for long periods of time, even though there’s no evidence they effectively treat chronic pain         Despite the lack of evidence for opioids’ effectiveness in treating chronic pain, doctors have resorted to prescribing the opioids to patients for exorbitant periods of time. (I can’t even count the number of people, from friends to family to colleagues, who have told me that a doctor prescribed extra weeks of pills “just to be safe. ”) This, it turns out, is extremely dangerous: A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the risk of dependency increases dramatically for each day someone is prescribed opioids. Overly long prescriptions, then, contribute to the cycle of addiction, overdose, and death that’s spread across the US in the past few years. Ideally, doctors should still be able to get painkillers to patients who truly need them  —   after, for example, evaluating whether the patient has a history of drug addiction. But doctors, who weren’t conducting even such basic checks, are now being told to give more thought to their prescriptions. And in many cases, they might find out that opioids aren’t the right answer. Yet if opioids aren’t the answer to chronic pain, what is? There are alternative treatments, although these can involve more work (and money) than just taking a pill  —   such as physical therapy, massage, and acupuncture. More exotic but less tested ideas include medical marijuana and kratom. But the reality is that, at some level, some patients struggling with chronic pain may just have to learn to live with the pain. This may sound cruel, but it’s something that’s asked of patients dealing with other chronic conditions when medicine just has no good answers. For example, a patient with heart disease might be told that she needs to eat less or adjust her activity level   —   potentially ruining her interests or hobbies  —   to avoid a heart attack as she becomes older. “You can’t use the pills to extend your limits. You have to accept that there’s some things you just won’t be able to do anymore,” Lembke told me. “People are very resistant to that idea. I think that speaks to some of the core hope for at least Americans that they should really be able to keep doing what they were doing in their 20s, and that somehow a doctor should be able to fix them and make that happen, instead of accepting that maybe that’s something that they just can’t do anymore. ”    11) States are now cracking down on opioid prescriptions         As the problem with opioid painkillers continues, different levels of government and regulatory bodies have taken steps to restrict their use. Some states, for example, have limited how long opioid painkillers can be prescribed. The idea is simple: After years of letting these painkillers run amok and kill tens of thousands of people, doctors need to be told to take a much more conservative approach to dangerous drugs. 12) Opioid users moved from painkillers to heroin, because heroin is so cheap    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   As governments and regulators cracked down on painkillers, however, many people addicted to the drugs didn’t just stop using. Many instead resorted to another opioid to fill their habit: heroin. A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found many painkiller users were moving on to heroin, and a 2015 CDC analysis found people who are addicted to prescription painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. Not all painkiller users went this way, and not all heroin users started with painkillers, but painkiller use played a big role in leading more people to heroin. The main reason for this: Heroin is extremely cheap in the black market, despite law enforcement efforts for decades to push up the price of drugs by cracking down on the illicit supply. In fact, over the past few decades, the price of heroin in the US has dramatically dropped  —   to the point that it’s not only cheaper than opioid painkillers sold in the black market, but frequently even candy bars. But heroin is also more potent and, therefore, deadlier than opioid painkillers. So even though not every painkiller user went to heroin, just enough did to cause the big spike in heroin overdose deaths that America has seen over the past few years. So now more people die of overdoses linked to heroin than die of overdoses linked to commonly prescribed painkillers. That doesn’t mean cracking down on painkillers was a mistake. It appeared to slow the rising number of painkiller deaths, and may have prevented doctors from prescribing the drugs  —   or letting them proliferate  —   to new generations of people who’d develop drug use disorders. So the crackdown did lead to more heroin deaths, but it will hopefully prevent future populations of drug users, who could have suffered even more overdose deaths. 13) Fentanyl has become a growing problem as well         As if the rise in heroin deaths wasn’t bad enough, over the past few years there has been evidence of another opioid that’s even more potent than heroin leading to more drug overdose deaths: fentanyl. Sometimes drug users purposely seek out this drug. But often it’s laced in other substances, like heroin and cocaine, without the users knowing it, leading to an overdose.    The fact that the efforts to crack down on the supply of opioid painkillers has only led people to even more dangerous drugs hints at another lesson from the epidemic: Just cutting access to opioids isn’t enough. As long as people are addicted, they’re going to try to find ways to satisfy that addiction, even if it means using more dangerous drugs. So while cutting access to opioids might in the long term stop the creation of new generations of people with drug use disorders, in the shorter term the country needs to devise solutions for how to get people to stop using drugs and how to make their drug use less deadly and dangerous. That’s where drug treatment, including   treatment that replaces dangerous opioid use with safer opioids like buprenorphine, and harm reduction efforts, such as clean needle exchanges, can help. 14)   drugs are involved in more overdoses as well            Opioid painkillers aren’t the only legal drug that’s killing more people. Federal data shows that benzodiazepines, such as Xanax and Valium, are also increasingly involved in overdose deaths. This speaks to another aspect of the drug overdose epidemic: It’s not always just one drug killing people. Very often, people use multiple drugs, from painkillers to cocaine to alcohol. This is especially bad because different drugs can heighten other drugs’ risk of overdose. Alcohol and benzodiazepines, for instance, are known to compound the overdose risk of opioids. The data speaks to this: Most benzodiazepine overdoses have involved opioids in the past few years, as the chart above shows. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously found that 31 percent of opioid painkiller overdose deaths in 2011 were also linked to benzodiazepines. 15) Most people who meet the definition for a drug use disorder don’t get treatment    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   While drug treatment may be the true solution to the opioid epidemic, the reality is it remains inaccessible to a lot of people. According to 2014 federal data, at least 89 percent of people who met the definition for having a drug use disorder didn’t get treatment. And that’s likely an underestimate: Federal household surveys leave out incarcerated and homeless individuals, who are more likely to have serious, untreated drug problems.    The reasons why vary. People might not have insurance to pay for drug treatment. If they do have insurance, their plans may not fully cover drug treatment. And even if their plans do cover drug treatment, there might not be enough space in treatment facilities to take them, leading to   or   waiting periods for care.  In general, all of this suggests that the country as a whole needs to put more resources toward making drug treatment options more widespread, accessible, and affordable. So far, Congress has taken some steps to that end, including a recent $1 billion boost in drug treatment funding over two years. But as so many people with drug use disorders struggle to get into treatment and the opioid epidemic continues, the call will likely grow for more action. ",-1.0
"The American economy’s big problem: we don’t have enough companies like Tesla.  Tesla’s biggest problem might not be finding customers for its forthcoming $35, 000 Model 3 electric sedan but figuring out how to actually build enough to meet the demand.    CEO Elon Musk has set a goal to produce 500, 000 cars a year between 2018 and 2020. That’s going to require expanding Tesla’s production facilities, which will require a lot of money. As a Bloomberg headline put it last week: ”Tesla needs billions to meet Musk’s ludicrous assembly timeline.” Now we know where those billions are going to come from. Bloomberg is reporting that Tesla will sell $2 billion in new shares to the public as a way of raising extra capital. This extra cash comes on top of billions the company has raised already. And that makes Tesla a real outlier in Silicon Valley. For all the breathless coverage of Silicon Valley’s alleged tech bubble, the really striking thing about most Silicon Valley startups is how little cash it takes to get them off the ground. Fortunately, there’s lots of money available to invest in     companies like Tesla. The problem for investors and the US economy is that there don’t seem to be nearly enough Teslas to go around.    It didn’t take much money to build big Silicon Valley companies To see how unusual Tesla is here, it’s helpful to compare it to Google.    Today, Google is one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a market value of almost $500 billion. Yet building the company was comparatively cheap. It raised just $26 million in outside investments prior to its 2004 initial public offering. Google has raised $1. 6 billion in its IPO  —   money that helped fund further expansion. But the company could have gotten along perfectly well without the money, as it had already generated $106 million in profits in 2003 and its search ad revenue was growing rapidly. Newer startups have been somewhat more aggressive about fundraising. Uber is the industry’s fundraising champion, with $10 billion raised over the past seven years. Airbnb has raised $2. 4 billion.    Google could have gotten along perfectly well without more money But like Google with its IPO money, these companies are largely raising money because they can get it at favorable rates  —   not because they particularly need it. Uber, for example, has said it’s already profitable in the United States but is spending billions to gain market share in China. Uber has also spent some of its capital to fund a   price war with rival Lyft. But none of these companies are investing all that much money in   tangible assets. They don’t manufacture physical products, so they don’t need factories. Uber doesn’t own the cars its passengers ride in. Airbnb doesn’t own the apartments its customers stay in. Google has invested millions in its data centers, but those expenses are a small fraction of its revenues. More Teslas would mean higher returns for investors            The ability to build a gigantic technology company with a small amount of capital is great news for the company’s founders and early investors, since it meant they get to keep a large share of the company’s eventual gains. But if you’re someone with money to invest, the situation isn’t so great.    Over the past decade, American companies have been generating more and more profits, and last year they paid more than $1 trillion out to shareholders. But shareholders have struggled to find anything productive to do with the money. If you add up all venture capital firms’ investments in 2015  —   including big investments in Uber and Airbnb and many smaller investments  —   the total was just $59 billion. Money raised in initial public offerings accounted for another $30 billion. With nothing better to do with the money, a lot of investors have simply used their dividends to buy more stock in existing public companies. These payments go to the companies’ previous shareholders  —   not the company itself  —   so they don’t lead the companies to put the money to productive use. Instead, share prices have been getting bid up. Right now, stocks in the Standard and Poor’s 500  —   an index of 500 large American stocks  —   are selling for almost 24 times their annual earnings. This is an unusually high value that signals that stocks are likely to produce   returns over the long run. At the same time, interest rates on government and corporate bonds are at their lowest point in decades. What investors need is a lot more   companies like Tesla: companies that need a ton of cash to grow quickly. Tesla is more   than most Silicon Valley companies because it sells physical products that take complex manufacturing facilities to build. Tesla is planning to spend $5 billion on just its ”gigafactory”  —   a vast facility to produce batteries for its cars. And if Tesla is successful, its appetite for capital will only increase. Even if the company achieves its goal of producing 500, 000 cars per year, it will still be a very small player in the overall auto market. It’s going to need to build many millions of cars a year to achieve Elon Musk’s goal of making electric cars the industry standard. And that will require building many more facilities for creating batteries and building cars. The problem for investors is that there just don’t seem to be very many companies like this. Too many investment dollars chasing too few investment opportunities. This may also explain the slowing growth of the US economy as a whole. Investments in new factories, equipment, and technologies are a major way that advanced economies grow. But while there’s lots of money available for this kind of investment, it seems to be getting harder and harder to find productive ways to put that money to work. ",-1.0
"Cop who tackled James Blake strikes deal to avoid trial. The cop who   in a case of mistaken identity won’t have to go through a public disciplinary trial, sources told The Post on Monday. NYPD Officer James Frascatore, 40, and the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board reached a deal in the 11th hour that allows the cop to dodge trial, sources said. Frascatore had been originally set to go to trial starting Monday on   charges and could have been found guilty of misconduct. The CCRB, which substantiated the complaint against him, was to prosecute the case in a trial room at One Police Plaza. But “it is accurate that they reached a deal,” a source said. Still, various sources said exact terms of the deal  —   including what if any discipline the cop would face  —   haven’t yet been finalized. A meeting would likely be held next week to hammer out the details, they said. Either way, details of the deal could remain secret because of a state statute that shields police officers’ disciplinary records from the public. Frascatore was stripped of his gun and shield after the incident and reassigned to an administrative post in the department’s detectives bureau. Blake’s lawyer, Kevin H. Marino, declined to comment Monday. The Police Department and the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association didn’t immediately return requests for comment. Frascatore’s lawyer, Stephen Worth, also declined comment. Frascatore got in trouble after a video showed him throwing Blake on the sidewalk outside the Grand Hyatt Hotel on Sept. 9, 2015. Frascatore had mistaken Blake for a suspected   fraudster whom his plainclothes NYPD team was seeking. Blake used the incident as a platform to talk about police racial bias. Blake is   and Frascatore is white. Both   Commissioner Bill Bratton and de Blasio apologized to Blake after the incident.",1.0
"The non-verdict of the police officer who killed Walter Scott is a national embarrassment.  The video in the North Charleston, South Carolina, police shooting of Walter Scott couldn’t be any clearer: Scott posed no threat to police officer Michael Slager when Slager shot at least eight times at Scott’s back. Scott was fleeing, but the    was barely running  —   he was moving so slowly that Slager could have caught up to him with a brisk walk. And the encounter began after Scott ran from a traffic stop over a broken brake light  —   hardly a matter of grave public concern.    And yet. On Monday, a jury concluded that it will not be able to reach a verdict in Slager’s murder trial, leading a judge to declare a mistrial. The police officer who shot and killed Scott now looks a little more likely to go free if the local prosecutor decides not to retry the case and if the federal civil rights charges also don’t stick. There have been ambiguous police killing cases in the past. We didn’t have video for the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The video of the police shooting of Tamir Rice in Cleveland was a bit blurry, but it showed that Rice really did have a toy gun that officers could have mistaken for a real firearm. Other police killing cases had similar ambiguities. But we had a clear video, from a bystander, of Scott’s death in April 2015. Scott was shot in the back, haphazardly fleeing from a confrontation that began over a broken brake light. What’s more, the video disproved parts of Slager’s story: Slager claimed that Scott tried to grab his stun gun before he opened fire. But the video shows Scott with his back against the officer when he’s shot. And it shows Slager walking over and seemingly planting the stun gun by Scott’s body, presumably to give his side credibility.     The video was so damning that it flipped major pundits who normally side with police in these cases. Conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity said on his show that “you do not shoot an innocent man in the back eight times in cold blood like this.   …     If he’s not a threat to the officer, or threat to anybody else, there is never a justification in terms of tactics and techniques and training. There’s no justification for what I see on that video. None. ” Conservative National Review writer Charles C. W. Cooke echoed a similar view.    So Scott didn’t appear to pose a threat to anyone at the time of the shooting, and there was no reason to believe letting him go would endanger the public, as the law generally requires to justify a shooting. And Slager’s initial side of the story turned out to be bullshit. But none of that was apparently enough to convince a jury to convict. Juries rarely convict police officers     In some ways, the result is totally unsurprising. Police are very rarely prosecuted for shootings  —   and not just because the law allows them wide latitude to use force on the job. Typically, juries are just very likely to side with police.    “There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,” David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer who   Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation, told Amanda Taub for Vox. “And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody who we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction. ” The Slager trial played into this: Slager testified that he felt Scott posed a threat at the time of the shooting, putting his word against the obvious takeaway from the video. And if Slager persuaded just one person to doubt the case against him, that’s enough  —   since a jury conviction requires a unanimous jury. That seems to be what happened. (Notably, 11 of 12 jurors were white, even though Charleston County is 28 percent black.)   ”Yes sir.”  Response from jury foreperson when asked if it’s true they are unable to reach a decision. #SlagerTrial #WalterScott —   T. J. Holmes (@tjholmes) December 5, 2016    The judge declared a mistrial after getting the jury’s  . The case could be retried, but it’s possible the prosecutor will decide not to.    But this is the typical outcome of police shooting cases: If police are charged, they’re very rarely convicted. The National Police Misconduct Reporting Project analyzed 3, 238 criminal cases against police officers from April 2009 through December 2010. They found that only 33 percent were convicted, and only 36 percent of officers who were convicted ended up serving prison sentences. Both of those are about half the rate at which members of the public are convicted or incarcerated. But the Scott shooting was supposed to be different. The national mood around police shootings has changed due to the Black Lives Matters protests. And this time there’s a clear video of what happened, showing that Scott was clearly not a threat to anyone, much less Slager, at the time he was shot or even if he had fled. And yet a man is dead, and the jury couldn’t convict the person who killed him.  Read more        American policing is broken. Here’s how to fix it. Step one: Police must admit there’s a problem.

"Officer Patrick Zamarripa survived three tours in Iraq before being killed in Dallas.        It had been 12 hours since he’d lost his son to one of the country’s worst mass police shootings, and he still couldn’t understand why. Dallas police officer Patrick Zamarripa, 32, had survived three tours in Iraq, one of the world’s most dangerous places, his father, Rick Zamarripa, said Friday. And then this. “He comes to the United States to protect people here,” his dad said. “And they take his life. ” Rick was watching television Thursday night when news broke that someone had opened fire in downtown Dallas around 9 p. m. at the end of a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in the city. He knew that his son had recently begun working as a bike officer in the downtown area, an assignment he enjoyed.    Patrick Zamarripa and Michael Krol of the Dallas Police Department and Brent Thompson of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit are the three victims who have been identified in the wake of Thursday’s shooting in Dallas. Two other officers were also killed and seven others were wounded. (Erin Patrick O’  Washington Post)   “Hey Patrick,” his father texted. “Are you okay?” Rick had asked his son that question before, because he knew Zamarripa’s job was perilous. The response usually came quickly: “Yes, dad. I’ll call you back. ” Not this time. “I didn’t hear nothing,” Rick said.   [The acts of heroism during a deadly night in Dallas]   He contacted Zamarripa’s longtime partner, Kristy Villasenor, who was at a Texas Rangers game with their    daughter, Lyncoln. Not long before, she’d taken a photo of her and Lyncoln’s feet propped on a railing high above home plate. They both wore matching   Converse tennis shoes. She posted the image to Facebook and tagged Zamarripa in it. “Glad Pat is there,” a friend wrote, “and not in Dallas right now  …     . ” “He’s not here,” she responded. “I just tagged him so he’ll get the pic. ” Soon after, Villasenor received word that she should head to the hospital. Rick sped east from his home 40 miles outside the city. He was the first family member to arrive. “How’s Patrick?” he asked an officer. “He wouldn’t tell me,” Rick said. “He had that look on his face. I knew. ” Patrick Zamarripa’s entire adult life had been devoted to service. He entered the Navy soon after high school, his father said, and saw combat while working for the military police in Iraq. When he got out about five years ago, he joined the Dallas Police Department. He just liked to help people, his father said. Greg Wise, 48, knew him a decade ago when they worked together at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. Zamarripa was focused and professional, Wise said, even as he talked about leaving the military before serving 20 years. Wise would often counsel young sailors who considered walking away before reaching retirement age. Many wanted to quit for the wrong reasons. But not Zamarripa. “For him, he was just tired of being away from the people he loved,” Wise recalled. “He wanted to go back and serve his community. ” Zamarripa, he said, had long known he would do that as a police officer in Texas. “I’ve been around the military for 30 years. I’ve seen a lot people come and go. A few stand out as being some of the good ones,” Wise said. “And he did. ” A friend, Rick said, had recently asked Zamarripa if he was interested in a job with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He declined. “No, I want to stay,” he said. “I love doing this. ” Both his Facebook and Twitter profiles are rife with salutes to other fallen officers and soldiers: “Rest in Peace” in honor of two New York cops killed in 2014; a blue stripe across a black image of Texas; the drawing of an eagle surrounded by the words, “Home of the Free Because of the Brave. ”   My deepest prayers from Dallas for my brothers and sister of #NYPD pic. twitter.   —   Patrick Zamarripa (@PatrickEZ01) December 21, 2014   His interests, outside of an avid devotion to the Rangers and Dallas Cowboys, were few.

"Trump and the CIA (Christians in Action).  “We don’t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,” said Donald Trump, while speaking to a group of Christian leaders in New York. “Now, she’s been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there’s no  —   there’s nothing out there. ” Trump, of course, is dead wrong about that, just as he is about so many other things on which he opines. There’s plenty “out there” about Hillary Clinton’s faith.  She is on the record about her role as a church   member and Sunday school teacher, and how her faith and teachings on forgiveness helped her endure disclosures of her husband’s affairs. She even allowed things to get out of hand in a 2007 New York Times interview, when she responded to such questions as “How do you feed [your] personal relationship with God? ,” “Do you believe that the resurrection of Jesus actually happened? ,” and “Do you believe on the salvation issue . . . that belief in Christ is needed for going to heaven?”  Instead of telling the interviewer that what she believes is “none of your business,” Clinton jumped through all the hoops to prove her religiosity. The questions were intrusive and her responses were   and I said so at the time.  Voters don’t have a right to know what a candidate thinks about the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Decalogue or being “slain in the Spirit. ”  We do need to know, however, about a candidate’s fealty to the Constitution and laws of the land. In reaching a judgment about a candidate’s fitness for office, we should want to know where the candidate stands on a host of issues, and his or her willingness and ability to defend the rights and protections of the law promised to all citizens.  But learning about a candidate’s views on public matters ought to be enough. Whether those views are informed by religion is not my chief concern  —   all arguments that I advanced in a column responding to the   executive editor of the New York Times who asserted in a 2011 article that candidates should be subjected to questions about their religious faith.  Obviously I’m on a different track from Trump and his Christian conservative supporters who want God in government.  This week, Trump expressed concern to a conservative gathering in New York that the United States is being damaged because he sees Christianity on a slide to becoming “weaker, weaker, weaker. ”  He proclaimed “my greatest contribution to Christianity  —   and other religions” will be “religious liberty” along with his promise to appoint antiabortion Supreme Court justices, make department store employees say “Merry Christmas” and let public school coaches lead sectarian prayer on the field. Reportedly he won a standing ovation.  Because that is what his crowd wants to hear. The Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, shares the presumptive GOP nominee’s fears. “We’re losing our country,” Graham told a rally on the steps of the state Capitol in Frankfort, Ky. in May. As a remedy, Graham is urging more pastors and preachers to seek elective office. “We need Christian men and women at every level,” he thundered. Graham, quoting a local official, wrote in a Facebook post: “Do you think that if people on your deacon board or pastoral board were serving on the school board that you would be discussing   bathrooms?”  Let us pause. Under the Constitution, there is no religious test or requirement for public office. Still, Christians haven’t been shut out of the game. Almost all U. S. presidents have been Christians, according to the Pew Research Center.  Nearly 92 percent of members of the House and Senate are Christians, compared with 73 percent of U. S. adults.  Protestant and Catholic justices have dominated for most of the U. S. Supreme Court’s history.  The overall U. S. population appears to be reflected in the religions of state legislators, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures: Protestants and Catholics predominate, with “unaffiliated” people represented in large numbers, too.  But many of those presidents, legislators and judges probably aren’t the kind of CIA (Christians in Action) that Trump is wooing, and that Graham is urging to run for office to, as Graham has said, put God back in the political debate.  But playing to fear persists. Earlier this month, Trump told another audience of evangelical Christians that, when he is president, “we will respect and defend Christian Americans. ” He repeated “Christian Americans” for emphasis. As a Christian, I neither want nor need the president of the United States to protect either my faith or me. However, I do want and expect the chief executive to respect and defend all Americans, regardless of their faith or their nonbelief.  A thought lost on Trump in his role as the Panderer in Chief.

"Leap year: Because the solar system doesn’t care about our calendar.  Like this video? Subscribe to Vox on YouTube.   This fact has been vexing humans for centuries: Earth’s year (one orbit around the sun) isn’t neatly divisible by its day (one rotation about its axis). One full orbit takes more than 365 days but less than 366.    That’s not surprising  —   there’s no reason for the two to be linked. The trouble comes when we try to overlay a useful calendar onto this random system. And as a result, our annual calendar is always slightly wrong. As the short video above shows, leap year is our   solution to this problem. To nudge our calendar closer to accuracy, we simply stick an extra day at the end of February every four years. Without it, our calendar would slowly shift further and further from the true year.                                      But technically, we should only add 97 percent of a day. Sounds close enough but after a century, we’ve overcorrected the calendar by nearly a day, so there are additional ”rules.” Science writer Phil Plait shows all the frustrating math on this, but here’s the takeaway:     If the year is divisible by 4, then it’s a leap year, UNLESS it’s also divisible by 100, then it’s not a leap year, UNLESS FURTHER the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.  And even after all these adjustments, the calendar will gradually shift over millennia. February 29, then, is an occasion to mark the indifference of space. The chaotic formation of the solar system gave rise to Earth’s   orbit and rotation. Only billions of years later did the resulting creatures try to coordinate their schedules. Check out the short video above for more information on why we need leap year.    ",-1.0
"Why Derek Jeter doesn’t feel prepared for fatherhood. Derek Jeter,    Hall of Fame New York Yankee and    dad, was asked if he was ready for his impending fatherhood. He admitted he wasn’t. “You know, I prided myself in my career to be prepared at all games,” he said. “Any time I’m unprepared, it makes me uncomfortable. I’m unprepared. ” What’s amazing about this is that not so long ago any dad, but in particular one with the kind of means that Jeter has, could have easily shrugged his shoulders and said, “Sure, I’m ready, nothing to it” and been mostly right. A father’s involvement was often  ; kids were the province of the mom or paid help. Don Draper was no| anomaly. Jeter’s child is being born at a time of unprecedented involvement and interest by dads in the lives of their children. A Pew poll last year found that 57 percent of dads considered parenthood to be “extremely important to their identity,” and 54 percent of dads find it rewarding “all of the time,” which is two points higher than even moms. It’s an excellent development. As   fatherhood becomes the norm, children benefit. Studies have shown that paternal involvement has increased sevenfold since the 1970s. A study last month from Imperial College London, King’s College London and Oxford University found that “an active male role in the early stages of babies’ development produced better performance in cognitive tests by the age of 2. ” Celebrities are reflecting this changed reality. In an interview last week about becoming a   father in his late 60s, Steve Martin said, “If I’d had a child earlier, I would have been a lousy father, because I would have misplaced my attention on my career. ” The acknowledgement that a famous actor focusing on his career over his child would have been a mistake is a new development. Also this month, golf pro Phil Mickelson made news when he decided to skip the US Open to attend his daughter’s   graduation. He told reporters it was a  : “It’s one of those things you just need to be there, so it wasn’t a hard decision. ” A few days ago, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld   an early Father’s Day lunch for the charity GOOD+ Foundation. The lunch benefits the charity’s Engaging Fathers program because fathers “make a significant difference in the   of their children” and there existed “a lack of social services supporting fathers. ”  Jerry sits on the charity’s “Fatherhood Leadership Council. ” Dads matter. Yet still the “bumbling dad” stereotype exists in TV shows and media  —   though there’s finally resistance to the trope. When The New York Times published a piece in January about men staying home for a weekend and, gasp, taking care of their own children while their wives went to the Women’s March, it was roundly mocked. It turned out that men making lunch for their kids and taking them to birthday parties wasn’t the arduous task portrayed by the Times but another     weekend. The idea that “dads are dumb and moms have to do everything” also persists. An ad for the classifieds app LetGo shows a man holding on to his beer dispenser for the eventual man cave he’ll build. His wife sighs and reminds him they’re turning the room into a playroom instead and sells his dispenser while the husband sinks into quicksand. Dad can’t even manage to avoid quicksand! Pop culture still has a ways to go to reflect the changing role of fathers, but it’s heading in the right direction. In January, I wrote in these pages about the hit show “This Is Us” and how part of its appeal is the portrayal of the father of the family: loving, nurturing, competent. It’s a better reflection of what modern fatherhood is trying to be. Fathers continue to have a hard road to climb to be equally involved parents. When a child is born, no one asks the dad if he plans to keep working or stay home to raise the baby. Fathers are expected to participate in decisions of   but it’s a running joke in our society that moms have the final say. It wouldn’t be crazy for men to prefer to retreat into their man caves and let the women go on running the show. The fact that dads aren’t doing that, that they prefer to be involved, should be applauded. A father’s role is important, and the more we acknowledge that and encourage fathers to participate in   the better.",1.0
"This is Google’s plan to revolutionize your house’s internet. Google Fiber is the ISP that everyone wants  —   absurdly fast, unlimited internet for a reasonable price. It could legitimately be called the   and that name now works in more ways than one. A   reveals that Google is exploring new technology to bring internet to users’ home without having to dig up streets. Google wants to conduct a trial of new wireless technology in California, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia, which could bring Fiber without any actual fiber cables.   In order to bring   internet to homes without wires, Google would use spectrum much higher than currently used in wireless cell networks. It would use frequencies between 3. 3 and 3. 8GHz, most likely using    technology. The FCC filing doesn’t reveal exactly how Google’s technology would work, but it’s easy to make an educated guess. The expensive part about Fiber is running   cable to individual houses. If you can run fiber to the network, and then use a different technology to distribute that connection to a few hundred individual homes, things are much cheaper. This is what ISPs around the world are already doing with     (FTTN) which runs fiber to a junction box, and then uses existing copper telephone lines for the last couple hundred yards. Google’s system would likely be similar, but using a   wireless connection for the final link. If it works, it will be cheaper, much easier to hook up, and hopefully mean that Google Fiber can quickly blanket the nation in its warm,   embrace.",1.0
"The Cowboys brain cramp that will haunt them. It’s the one that got away, again. Yes, the Dallas Cowboys made a brilliant   comeback in the fourth quarter to tie the Green Bay Packers with 35 seconds remaining in their NFC Divisional Round playoff  . Yes, on    with under 10 seconds left, Aaron Rodgers managed to roll out and throw a bullet to Jared Cook,  . Yes, Mason Crosby hit two   late field goals from   yards, including the   (kicks have never been more exciting  —   the first was a knuckler that somehow tumbled in, the second looked wide left before drifting back in with no time on the clock). But despite the magical effort it took from the Packers, you still can’t shake the feeling that Dallas let one go en route to a fifth straight loss in the divisional round that extends their franchise record of 21 straight years without an appearance in the NFC Championship game.   —   the kind that’s felled Dallas on different occasions during that drought. There’s no lasting image of Tony Romo sitting in shock on the field, like he was that night in Seattle 10 years ago. The Cowboys can hold their heads high. This was more a missed opportunity, a gift given and declined. In a way, that makes it more painful. The play that   ended the Cowboys season was the Crosby   field goal. The play that   ended the Cowboys season was the   pass immediately before it. But when the autopsy on the Dallas season is complete  —   a season in which the team tied a franchise record for wins (yup, not even Troy, Emmitt and Michael ever had more than 13 victories) earned   advantage for the second time in 20 years and    —   there’s one play that started all the dominoes. Late in the game, with Dallas trailing by three, Dak Prescott hit Jason Witten for an   gain to set up    at the Green Bay 40 with 49 seconds left and the Cowboys holding one timeout. They had enough time and downs to do what they wanted. But when Prescott took the   snap, he spiked the ball to stop the clock. The ripple effect was subtle but undeniable. You kill the clock when there’s no other option. You don’t kill the clock when you have plenty of time to run plays and downs are your most precious commodity. Yet the Cowboys  —   down three and in   range  —   wasted one of their three offensive downs because they didn’t want to take a few more seconds to call a play. They killed a clock that wasn’t close to killing them. “Just felt like that was the right thing to do at the time,” Cowboys coach Jason Garrett  . “Keeping the timeout to be able to kick a field goal is really important if you can do it. So in those situations, when you make a first down, we believe you clock it there so you keep the timeout in your back pocket. Obviously in that situation we’re trying to go down and score a touchdown, so you want to keep as much time on the clock as you can. If the clock is going and you need a timeout to get yourself in   range, you have that one still available to you. ” Garrett’s decision had a   effect: 1. Dallas would only have two plays to make a first down because, barring a sack, it would have to attempt the   field goal on fourth down. When you have first down, why do you intentionally make it second? 2. The spike cut down the chances of an Ezekiel Elliott run on the next two plays. A handoff to Zeke should have been called on first down, and if his 5. 7 yards per carry were any indication, it could have put Dallas in a position to run any number of plays on second or third. Instead, Elliott didn’t get the ball again, and Dallas had to kick. Elliott getting only 22 carries against a Packers defense unable to stop him was practically criminal. If he’d had 30, that defense might have collapsed. Instead, the Cowboys passed eight more times than they ran, a situation brought on by the deficit, but exacerbated by a lack of guts and imagination. Prescott was great, Dez Bryant played one of his best games and the Packers corners couldn’t hang. But Zeke was the force behind all of it. Once the ball was taken out of his hands, Green Bay’s defense stiffened. 3. And then there was the ultimately crippling effect. When a team’s down in a game, it’s easy to say it should do this or that with the clock. Don’t score too early! Let some time run off! (Don’t spike it!) But that’s hindsight stuff. In the moment, you have to worry about getting your points. Since the Cowboys’ worry was in stopping the clock with 49 seconds left, when the   and   plays both stopped the clock, there was still 35 seconds left after Dan Bailey kicked his   field goal. Those precious seconds would prove fatal, leading to another offseason in Big D of wondering where it all went wrong. This article   on  .",1.0
"GOP voters know Trump is telling them the truth, and the media is lying to them.          A new Quinnipiac poll finds that President Trump’s approval rating has soared all the way up to 38 percent. And a majority of Americans overall say they trust the media, not Trump, to tell them the truth about important issues. But a huge majority of Republicans say they trust Trump, not the media, to tell them the truth:     More   whites ( ) and white men ( ) also see Trump as the one telling the truth. The poll has a bit of a mixed verdict on this topic, finding that Americans disapprove of the media’s treatment of Trump by  . But far more Americans disapprove of Trump’s treatment of the media:       Again, Republicans overwhelmingly break with the American public overall on this: nearly   of them approve of Trump’s treatment of the media. The news media is held in terrible esteem by the American people, and there are understandable reasons for this, which perhaps explains why only 52 percent believe the media tell the truth. The press has major credibility problems. But Trump has gone well beyond questioning the media’s credibility as an arbiter of truth. He recently tweeted that the media is the “enemy of the American people,” a claim that senior White House adviser Reince Priebus did not disavow. As president, Trump has accused the media of covering up terrorist plots. Senior Trump adviser Stephen Bannon has railed against the media as “the opposition party. ” At his recent rally in Florida, Trump uncorked a very long diatribe against the press, claiming that the media make things up “in many cases,” that the media is a “part of the corrupt system,” and that “they have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. ” He said he had attended the rally in order to speak to his supporters “without the filter of the fake news,” vowing that he will “never, ever let them get away with it” when “the media lies to people. ” The media is the enemy of Trump’s supporters, and he is their protector. Trump even cast the media as the enemy of freedom: “We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices. ” Trump is empowering people to choose their own reality, and their own facts. As I’ve repeated endlessly, Trump is trying to obliterate the very possibility of agreement on the free press’ legitimate institutional role in our democracy  —   indeed, he’s trying to obliterate the possibility of shared agreement on reality itself.  This has worried some conservatives, too. As Bret Stephens recently put it, Trump is “denying the claim that facts are supposed to have on an argument,” and his overall message is that facts “needn’t have any purchase against a man who is either sufficiently powerful to ignore them or sufficiently shameless to deny them  —   or, in his case, both. ” In other words, the entire point is the assertion and demonstration of the power to say what reality is in contradiction of what is empirically, demonstrably true. And he’s granting his supporters a stake in that power. For Trump, everything and everyone can be broken down into winners and losers, in which the former prevail at the expense of the latter. By appropriating the power to say what reality is for himself (and for his supporters, or so they believe) he leaves the media  —   the institutional free press  —   wholly bereft of it. It’s hard to say whether this is rooted in showman’s instinct, or in childlike rage at something he can’t control, or in true authoritarian tendencies, and, related to them, in a long term plan to weaken the press as an institutional check on his power later. Dana Milbank speculates today that all of this is part of an “attempt to delegitimize the structures of civil society, following similar attacks on the courts and the intelligence community. ” If so, it’s good to see that majorities see the news media, not Trump, as the    —   even if there is still a lot of work to be done to earn the public’s trust. Of course, Republican voters see him as the truth teller. There may be all kinds of reasons for this that have nothing to do with Trump. But regardless, the attacks on the press may only endear him to them, and so they may be working for him as intended  —   at least to some degree.  ",-0.5
"She came to Cleveland uncertain about Trump. She left ready to vote for him..   CLEVELAND  —   From Aimee Winder Newton’s perch at the back of the convention floor, Donald Trump started on the right note. Newton had come to Cleveland seeking reassurance about the man whose incendiary, pompous personality left her worried that for the first time in her life she might not be able to support her party’s presidential nominee. Then Trump came on stage and said he “humbly” accepted the nomination. And though his exhaustive and dark address would still give her pause, Newton felt confident by the end that she could make a decision. “I can do this,” she said. Four days earlier, as the convention got underway, Newton had not been so certain.      The    Salt Lake County council woman was part of the delegation from Utah, home to Trump’s most embarrassing defeat. And now the state’s delegates were being asked to make the country’s largest leap. Newton is conservative and deeply religious. Her Mormon faith taught her to be kind and trustworthy, to speak well of others and not to ostracize those who don’t share her beliefs. The new leader of her party had had extramarital affairs and has been divorced twice. He maligned his opponents and called for a ban on Muslims. If Newton was going to support her party, she feared she would have to put aside her principles. Newton and many of her fellow Utahans came to Cleveland hoping that a   crisis of conscience among her fellow delegates would prevent Trump from getting the nomination. Still, Newton didn’t consider herself a Never Trumper. More like a Maybe Trumper. She was looking for a bit of humanity, a semblance of humility, something that felt right and could inspire her to follow Trump’s leadership. When she bumped into the husband of Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( .) one of her political role models, she thought maybe he could help. “Help me. Why did you decide to support Trump?” Newton recalled asking.   Utah delegate Casey Voeks converses on the final day of the convention. (Michael    Washington Post)  “We really want a president who could be a role model for our children. So this is really hard for us. ” Chuck Blackburn said what many who know Trump say: He’s different in private. He’s not mean. The bombast goes away. He can be gracious and kind. Blackburn said Trump had endeared himself to his wife. “All of these things are helping,” Newton said. Maybe she would see this side of Trump during the convention. Maybe she could offer her support. Newton hoped to get a little closer when Melania Trump spoke on the first night. She listened intently as Trump spoke of her husband’s strength, his love and loyalty. The audience applauded politely. Newton and her delegation were not impressed. “She comes out, and here she is, 24 years younger than her husband,” Newton said. “She’s his third wife. He’s still had the affairs. She didn’t tell us anything more about him. It just makes him seem like he can’t relate to anyone but the elites. ”    Politics has defined Newton’s life. She ran for student body vice president in high school, helped to lead the College Republicans and served on a   county council that had five Republicans and four Democrats. They worked together. In a recent fight over how to try to fix the criminal justice system, the Republicans went along with a Democratic plan after a deal to cut a   dollars from the budget. A compromise. This was how democracy was supposed to function, Newton said. “I don’t know if I understand what is going on in the rest of America,” Newton said on the floor of Quicken Loans Arena on the second night. The rest of her delegation was with her. “Make America safe again? I feel safe,” said Casey Voeks, 27. “My kids are able to go out all the time, and we never lock our doors. Make America great again? Our lives are pretty great. We don’t feel like the country is as bad as they are making it seem, at least not in Utah. ” Voeks worried most about what he saw as a shift away from the federal government’s core principles. President Obama’s   law seemed like overreach, as did the nationalization of school testing standards. “We are proof that local, small government works,” Voeks said. Nonetheless, he was able to acknowledge good things about Obama. He was a good father to his children and had good intentions. “He’s a good man,” his friend David Kyle, 35, said. “Unlike Hillary. ” “It’s true,” Voeks said. “Obama’s wrong. But Hillary’s evil. ” Trump, Voeks said, might be clueless. Voeks worried that so much of Trump’s campaign was about asking voters to trust him, that the candidate never mentioned freedom or the Constitution. “If he did those things, I might be able to vote for him,” Voeks said. “Until then, I don’t know. ” As he spoke, the rest of the crowd was being roused to a standing ovation for Donald Trump Jr. But the Utah delegation stayed in their seats and fiddled with their phones. Newton went to dinner. Voeks laughed and wondered who cared. Their stance against Trump went beyond political dissatisfaction. And, Voeks said, it might have been emboldened in Northeast Ohio. Most of the delegation belonged to the Mormon Church. Twenty miles away from Cleveland, in Kirtland, Joseph Smith had started a settlement  —   only to face prejudice and discrimination that forced the church to move and move. Because of that history, the talk during this campaign of singling out a group based on religion held a particular sting for Voeks. “People kicked us out or ordered our extermination. So when we hear a man talk about banning an entire group of people, be it Muslims or Hispanics or refugees, we take it seriously,” he said. “We know what it’s like. It’s not a joke. ”    The next morning, the Utah delegation piled into rental cars and buses for a trip to visit Kirtland. As the rest of the delegation finished lunch, Newton rode a mile east to the Mormon religion’s first temple with her father, Kent Winder, and her brother, Mike. On the way there, she brought up Donald Trump Jr. ’s speech. She had been moved to hear the younger Trump discuss how his father had insisted that his children learn how to operate heavy machinery. She also appreciated the elder Trump’s affinity for construction workers. “It made him seem like he had some good values,” Newton said. “It seemed like he raised good kids. I know a lot of that is attributed to his wife, but I was really impressed by them and his work to keep them grounded. ” “I’m getting closer,” she conceded. A tour guide came to meet Newton’s family, along with a couple who came with the convention delegation from Hawaii. All of their eyes widened when they walked into the house of worship, its walls covered in white with   high ceilings and large, Gothic windows that let in bright beams of light. The group sat in the pews while the tour guide told the story about the first service, of its large crowds of dedicated believers coming together and singing the hymn “The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning. ” At the end of the tour, Newton’s father asked if the group might be able to get the chance to sing the song. Newton took to the old piano in the corner. The guests from Hawaii gave the pitch. Their voices blended together and bounced off the walls as they joined to sing an iconic song of their faith. As they walked out of the church, the visitor from Hawaii approached them. “Oh, you’re from Utah?” she said. “You’ve been having a hard time. ” “We’re trying,” Newton told her. “We really are. ” The delegate told Newton that she, too, had a hard time getting comfortable with Trump until she read some of his books. And when that wasn’t quite enough, she read Ivanka Trump’s book. The books helped to show her that Trump had a sense of fairness and spirit, true American values. Mike Winder offered that when Trump first publicly considered running for office, he read the mogul’s first political tome, “The America We Deserve. ” It spoke of renegotiating trade deals, being tough on crime and battling terrorists. “I actually thought he’d be a good president then,” Mike Winder said. “Over time, the rhetoric changed. ” “I think you can get there,” said Kathy Kamauu, the delegate from Hawaii. “We have to. We’re Republicans. ” As her father started the car engine, he told his children, “I have to say, visiting this temple will be the highlight. ”    Before coming to the floor on the third night, Newton and the delegation started getting emails from Utahans complaining about their lack of enthusiasm. So when someone handed a sign that said “Make America First Again” to Casey Voeks, he took it. But he couldn’t bring himself to lift it up. Too embarrassing. “It’s so close to Make America Great Again, and I can’t stand it,” Voeks said. But then Voeks saw a man with signs saying, “America Deserves Better than Hillary. ” Those were words he could get behind. “This is great marketing for Utah,” Voeks said. “A sign I would wave, proudly. It says nothing about Trump. ” Voeks ran to the other side of the convention floor to pick up as many as his hands could hold. Team Utah snatched them up. As Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke, many in the delegation stood with a newfound enthusiasm. When Walker abbreviated the phrase to “America Deserves Better,” Voeks shouted back, “THAN HILLARY. ” Now, the delegation was buzzing. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Voeks’s preferred candidate and Newton’s second choice after Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) was coming up soon. The delegation was crowding the aisles. They whooped until Cruz quieted them. Voeks clasped his hands when Cruz told the story of a    girl who lost her dad in the police shooting in Dallas. He nodded along as Cruz discussed the Bill of Rights. He erupted in   shrieks when Cruz told the crowd to “vote their conscience. ” But, if the delegates were looking for Cruz to help resolve their dilemma, they would be disappointed. Cruz’s mind on Trump did not seem to be made up, either, and the rest of the crowd booed the delegation’s   candidate off the stage. Newton was a fan of that night’s star,   nominee Mike Pence, but the hubbub following Cruz’s appearance was too distracting to focus on Pence. Newton was too busy discussing whether Cruz’s speech was honorable or selfish. Voeks walked off the floor.    On the fourth night, Newton was captivated by Ivanka Trump. She clutched her heart as Trump’s daughter told stories of playing with Legos in her father’s office and described how the Trump Organization gives equal pay to women. Finally, a sign of the sensitivity that Newton had been searching for all week. Soon, the man himself would appear on stage. Newton wanted to see his heart. Voeks wanted to see his brain. All around, convention staffers passed around signs, “Millennials for Trump,” “Women for Trump,” “Make America Great Again. ” The delegation mostly passed them around and around because no one wanted them. Newton took one to be a team player. But then Trump started to speak. His initial expression of humility struck a tone that Newton had never expected. She and her fellow delegates applauded when he talked about addressing crime and putting American needs at the forefront. Then Trump began talking about his policies on immigration. Newton stopped clapping entirely when he talked about banning people who came from other countries compromised by terrorism, as did most of the delegation. Was this the introduction of the darker Trump they didn’t like? Then, a reprieve. He talked about the importance of appointing conservative Supreme Court justices. Trump thanked religious and evangelical groups for their support. “I’m not sure I totally deserve it,” he said. There was an audible gasp in the delegation. “He knows?” one said. Newton looked to the women who sat next to her. “I love that,” she said. “I love his  . ” Voeks’s cellphone rang immediately after Trump’s speech concluded. It was his father, wondering if he had “converted to Trump. ” Voeks said he wasn’t sure. But as balloons and   confetti rained down on the convention floor, encasing everyone in   blobs of red, white and blue, Newton took to her cellphone and smiled for a selfie. “His brutal honesty might be the thing I hate, but I’m starting to realize it can be the thing I love,” she said. “Sometimes, we just have to compromise. ” She took a deep breath and said: “I’m in. ”  ",-0.5
"Twitter Burn: The Independence Day Kids Get the Last Laugh.

"Stop Trump, then remake conservative politics.      In the 2016 election cycle, two things have happened simultaneously. Conservatives need to separate the two in order to understand the fix they are in and how to work their way out of it. First, an unstable, thuggish demagogue arrived on the scene. In the wasteland of American culture, where manners and civic education have deteriorated, he seized the imagination of alienated, economically stressed Americans, turning their anxiety into hatred of foreigners and breeding a certain nihilism. He demands that his adherents ignore what is before their eyes and place their faith in one person with all the answers (none of the facts, however) which he insists are simple and quick. Second, the GOP discovered (in part, through Sen. Ted Cruz’s collapse despite perfect mechanical execution) that there is no majority supporting the Reagan agenda. Certainly, Cruz was a politician of limited talent and imagination, but if he could not sell the “  stool” to the masses, perhaps there are no masses receptive to that sort of stuff. Even in a GOP primary, there is no majority looking to roll back gay rights or give huge tax breaks to   Americans.    Some Republicans in Congress could be at risk of losing seats, in part because of the party’s controversial presidential candidate Donald Trump. These are some the Republicans who are feeling the ”Trump effect” the most. (Deirdra O’  Washington Post)   Now, those who oppose Donald Trump don’t necessarily oppose him for the same reason. Moderates, conservatives, secular Republicans and religious conservatives have figured out that he is a dangerous character, one whose temperament precludes entrusting him with the powers of the presidency. It is disappointing, stunning even, that some Republicans cannot or will not recognize the magnitude of his mendacity. Opportunists such as Newt Gingrich are to be expected, but Sen. Tom Cotton ( .) and Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) have fallen in line as well. We had hoped they were made of sterner stuff. Other Trump opponents conclude that he’s not conservative enough  —   pining away for the 1980s version of conservatism that we found out was no longer salient. This latter group is right to oppose Trump’s hodgepodge of inane ideas (tariffs, roundups, authoritarian power) but it’s mistaken if it thinks the solution is to revert to 1980s Reaganism. Cruz and a dozen other candidates tried that; it failed. There are not enough states (and hence, not enough electoral votes) willing to buy that recycled playbook. Even within the GOP, there just are not enough “very conservative” voters to give such candidates even a plurality. Strident   rhetoric gets you good cable ratings and a good turnout at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) but not an electoral win. Voters on the right can follow Trump from here on out, becoming a   populist party akin to those in Europe. That is unacceptable to most Americans and politically toxic in a country as diverse and tolerant as ours. It’s a dead end, with or without Trump atop it. It is     and pessimistic. Its proposals (e. g. protectionism, nativism, isolationism) are unworkable and counterproductive. It is not in keeping with   and optimism; it attempts to turn back the clock (bring back manufacturing jobs!) in ways that are not possible and that would wish away globalism and huge shifts in popular opinion. Isolationism is an ineffective response to Islamist jihadism, as we learned in the Obama presidency, and is incompatible with American values. What is the alternative? The challenge for Republicans is twofold: Stop a “pathological liar,” an amoral man, from attaining the White House and  —   separately  —   figure out how conservatism must adapt and change for the 21st century. Pouring old wine into new bottles is a nonstarter. At bottom, Republicans must figure out what, if any, incarnation of conservatism makes policy and political sense. Two conservatives have offered up a menu. Sen. Ben Sasse ( .) suggests: A national security strategy for the age of cyber and jihad; Honest   reform so that we stop stealing from future generations; Empowering states and local governments to improve   education, and letting Washington figure out how to update federal programs to adjust to now needing lifelong learners in an age where folks are obviously not going to work at a single job for a lifetime anymore; and Retiring career politicians by ending all the incumbency protections, special rules, and revolving door opportunities for folks who should be public “servants,” not masters. Eliot A. Cohen proposes: [R]everence for the Constitution; serious grappling with the domestic problems associated with economic opportunity for all, education and affordable health care; and commitment to the internationalist tradition of the   War II consensus. It would advocate a federal government that can energetically do the things it should, but would limit the role of unaccountable regulators and bureaucrats and push to states and local governments every function that is not clearly a duty of the federal government. Above all, it would be committed to liberty in every sphere of personal and public life. We would also include a comprehensive approach to poverty and a focus on upward mobility. Somewhere in that mix are the contours of a platform that is contemporary and conservative and for which there is arguably a broader demographic and geographic appeal. It should not include (for there is no political appetite for these things, and they are unattainable   unwise from a policy standpoint): opposition to gay rights; large tax cuts for the rich; protectionism; expelling women from combat in a volunteer army; rooting gays out of the military; obsessing over bathroom assignments; fixating on local ordinances about wedding services; keeping the status quo on entitlements; cutting out (as opposed to reforming) the safety net; never, ever raising taxes on anyone; and mass deportation. What follows will be different from 1980s conservatism because we are more than three decades removed from Ronald Reagan. Our problems are different  —   stagnant wages, resurgent and varied enemies, the withering of communal organizations, crumbling infrastructure. We have recognized that the old solutions  —   a rising tide lifts all boats (not if you have no skills)  —   are insufficient. However, Republicans should not sell snake oil. Telling   whites that the problem is immigrants is a lie. The economic data overwhelmingly show that immigration spurs growth, creates jobs and aids innovation, and no amount of junk statistics from   Malthusians is going to change this. (There are solutions for the tiny segment of the workforce, usually the last wave of immigrants, that might be adversely affected.) Telling workers that millions of jobs went to China is a lie, too. The problems are real, and the solutions must be real as well. We need the world’s best and brightest workers, a humane society and methods to control borders and prevent visa overstays. Along with all of this, conservatives have to end their intellectual isolation and  . They need to stop pretending that climate change is not occurring (the extent and the proposed solutions can be rationally discussed) or imagining that there is a market for     government. Conservatives must end their infatuation with phony news, crank conspiracy theories, demonization of   leaders and mean rhetoric. It’s time to grow up, turn off Sean Hannity, get off toxic social media and start learning about the world as it is. (Read a book authored by someone without a talk show, spend time with   take an online course in economics.) Confirmation bias has become pathological. This is all daunting and complicated. Many people have a financial interest in keeping conservatives angry and invested in bad causes. Ignore them. The scorecards are meaningless, the CPAC straw poll is nonsense and the talk radio audiences are entirely unrepresentative of the country or even the party as a whole. The undertaking begins with stopping Trump. Beyond that, people of good will and common sense can work either within the old Republican Party or in a new (Hamiltonian? Reform? Opportunity?) Party. Unless conservatives get their act together, we will become a   ever   country, at least at the national level.",-0.5
"Tyler Lockett’s gruesome leg injury caps a day in which Derek Carr, Marcus Mariota were hurt.      If there was a theme to the Christmas Eve games, as NFL teams battled for playoff spots and some sort of momentum with the playoffs two weeks away, it was an awful one. Completing the terrible trifecta of “legs aren’t supposed to bend that way” injuries, Tyler Lockett of the Seattle Seahawks joined Marcus Mariota and Derek Carr.  Lockett was headed for surgery after his right leg became pinned beneath Brandon Williams of the Arizona Cardinals as the two fell to the turf on Lockett’s touchdown reception. As quarterback Russell Wilson celebrated the   score, he ran toward the end zone and quickly discovered that Lockett was hurt. “ . . . I got close to him,” Wilson said, “and there was blood everywhere near his ankle. So that was an ugly situation. You just pray for him. ”   Tyler Lockett #injury. Hell of a player, get well soon! #Seahawks pic. twitter.   —   newt205 (@newt205) December 24, 2016   Lockett, the team’s No. 2 wide receiver, is expected to have surgery and is out for the rest of the season, according to Coach Pete Carroll, declining to say exactly what the injury is. “All of us were heartbroken for him over there, and he was consoling us,” said Doug Baldwin, one of the teammates who gathered around as Lockett’s leg was immobilized and he was carted off. “That speaks volumes about his faith and his resolve and the manner in which he goes about handling obstacles. This is just another obstacle for him, and I have no doubt that he’s going to come back from this stronger, both physically, mentally and spiritually. ” For the Seahawks, it was an especially sobering reminder of their mortality. Although they have won the NFC West at    they are hardly the menacing opponent that went to consecutive Super Bowls in 2014 and 2015. And, to boot, they’re likely to have to face the task of winning two games on the road.    Russell Wilson offers a kind word as Tyler Lockett is carted off. (Ted S.  )  Lockett was the third player to go down with a leg injury Saturday. Mariota, whose Tennessee Titans have been eliminated from the playoffs, and Carr, touted as an MVP candidate for the Oakland Raiders, both went down with broken fibulas. Mariota’s season already was over; Carr’s is now, but he tweeted Saturday evening that he is “not worried one bit. ”  The same can’t be said for Raiders and Seahawks fans.   Thank you!

"Lester Holt shows he doesn’t know the meaning of ‘impartial’. The ref not only made himself part of the game on Monday night, he ran up to the scrimmage line, then sacked the quarterback three times. In the early going, it looked like it was going to be an ideal, Jim   performance from Lester Holt, the “NBC Nightly News” anchor. Lehrer was so boringly nonpartisan, so unwilling to play gotcha that he was always hotly in demand to moderate debates. For the first half or so, Holt gave simple, broad,   questions and let the candidates go at it. He didn’t venture into live   didn’t much quarrel with the nominees, didn’t ask persnickety questions. For the most part, Holt asked the kinds of basic questions that gave Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump plenty of opportunities to repeat favored talking points: What would you do to pump some life into the job market? How would you heal the race divide? Are police biased against minorities? What’s your policy on homegrown terrorist attacks? But in the last half of the show, Holt started going after Trump. He got into an unfortunate bickering match with the Republican nominee over the latter’s (apparently offhand) support for the Iraq War in a 2002 Howard Stern interview. It was perfectly reasonable to bring up the point, but the exchange became tiresome on both sides, with the two men talking past each other. Holt would have been wiser to simply say, “In 2002, you told Howard Stern you supported the Iraq War. Tonight you say you didn’t. Can you explain?” Arguing with Trump is Clinton’s job, not Holt’s. Trump’s birther   is something the media have shown far too much interest in given its relative   but it was also fair of Holt to give Trump a chance to put the question to rest in front of a large audience. Trump bungled the opportunity, but it was hardly an unfair topic to bring up given that questioning President Obama’s birthplace is how Trump became a national political figure in the first place, and given that Trump made a circus out of the matter just 10 days earlier. Still, having put Trump on the hot seat on a couple of questions, and giving no such pushback to Clinton, Holt then got into a third    with the GOP   demanding that Trump answer for his remark that Clinton didn’t have “the look” of a president. When Trump tried to change the subject to stamina, Holt (and then Clinton) pressed the point. So Holt’s questions were fair game, but it’s not the case that Clinton has nothing to be embarrassed about either. Holt might have questioned her about, for instance, the role she played in arranging the sale of American uranium assets to Russia after Clinton and her foundation accepted large checks from shady intermediaries. He might have noted that she was chided by the FBI for her reckless mishandling of classified information, or that she put sensitive national security information on a server, less secure than Gmail, that could easily be hacked by the Russians. He could have asked her whether she could be trusted about her health given that she apparently wasn’t going to tell the public she had pneumonia until she collapsed on   (and even then stonewalled for hours). True, Hillary Clinton has answered a lot of these kinds of questions before, but not in front of a huge national audience. For Holt to allow her to get away with saying, “It was a mistake” on her usage of email doesn’t cut it, not from a guy who was willing to hammer Trump on a remark like “I just don’t think she has a presidential look. ”",1.0
"Is water the fuel of the future?. Soon, water may be powering all your favorite appliances. Scientists have developed a speedy new system to find materials that could potentially be used in making solar fuels,   in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Solar fuels are a completely renewable energy source created from combining sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. The fuel is created using what is essentially artificial photosynthesis, and the result could eventually replace oil, coal and other fossil fuels. It sounds simple enough, but to fulfill the dream of every clean energy enthusiast, science must find a way for light to literally split water and isolate part of it for use as an energy source. Each water molecule has one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms  —   pure hydrogen is super flammable and   making it perfect fuel. But this process is tricky, since water doesn’t break itself apart when sunlight hits it. (If it did, we’d have much less ocean, for one thing.) For the molecule to split, there must be a   catalyst to help it along. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have been testing possible candidates in search of that catalyst. “For any technology that our society is trying to build, we always need new materials,” John Gregoire, lead author of the study, told The Post. “And we know what we want the materials to do, but it’s hard to figure out what materials will give us those properties. ” Researchers have been trying to identify a cheap and efficient material  —   known as a photoanode  —   to serve as this catalyst for a long time. In the last four decades, scientists have only identified 16 of these materials. And, due to a range of shortcomings which include being too expensive or not absorbing enough sunlight to spark the reaction, they’ve almost all hit a dead end. But a new system, described in the study as a “  method,” discovered 12 new photoanodes in just two years. And the faster these materials are identified, the sooner they’re tested and the closer we become to a possible source of renewable energy. “This integration of theory and experiment is a blueprint for conducting research in an increasingly interdisciplinary world,”   “It’s exciting to find 12 new potential photoanodes for making solar fuels, but even more so to have a new materials discovery pipeline going forward. ”",1.0
"Who, exactly, was Ivanka Trump endorsing?.        As the    speaker at the Republican convention, Ivanka Trump had two goals. First, to leverage her likability on behalf of the next speaker, her father. And second, to demonstrate to women that Donald Trump was the sort of candidate who would have their backs. ”My father values talent,” Ivanka Trump said. ”He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.” At her father’s company, she said, ”there are more female than male executives. Women are paid equally for the work that we do, and when a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out.” She delineated some policy proposals:   ”As President, my father will change the labor laws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of the workforce. And he will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.”   ”Politicians talk about wage equality, but my father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career. He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him.” Sounds good. The only catch is that Donald Trump himself has never outlined those proposals, even roughly. The candidate who has is Hillary Clinton.    Ivanka Trump her father Donald Trump into the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 21, 2016. (Photo by Michael Robinson   Washington Post)  Let’s group Trump’s arguments into three groups: equal pay, affordable child care and paid family leave, which Trump doesn’t mention specifically but which her comments about women not being ”shut out” seem to get at. Here’s what the two candidates have to say on the subject of each. Equal pay What Donald Trump says: Of the three topics on our list, Trump has been asked about this the most. The most supportive he’s been appears to have been comments he made during an Aug. 20, 2015, interview on MSNBC’s ”Morning Joe.” Host Mika Brzezinski raised the topic alongside   Joe Scarborough. BRZEZINSKI: How would you address the ongoing problem of women getting access to capital? SCARBOROUGH: I’m glad you asked that question. TRUMP: Women should have absolute access to capital, Mika. BRZEZINSKI: Yes, but . .. TRUMP: When it comes to categorizing people, men and women into a group, it gets to be very dangerous. When you have to categorize men and women into a particular group and a particular pay scale, it gets very. ... Because people do different jobs. If they do the same job, they should get the same pay. .. SCARBOROUGH: There you go. TRUMP: . .. but it’s very hard to say what is the same job. It’s a very, very tricky question. And I talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, Mika; this is one of the things that we have to look at very strongly. SCARBOROUGH: But you did say, though, and I think this is what, Mika, you’re getting at, equal pay for equal jobs. As soon as he heard an endorsement of the subject, Scarborough pounced, later offering the sentiment more clearly: ”You did say, though . .. equal pay for equal jobs.” Our Cal Borchers pointed out that this is a pattern with Trump: His vagueness is often honed by interviewers into something coherent. So Trump did say what Scarborough summarized  —   but with caveats. Interestingly, Trump had declined to offer any comment when the same question came up on the show on Aug. 10, only 10 days earlier. BRZEZINSKI: How would you approach the issue of equal pay and also helping more women get access to capital  —   capital, which they struggle with? TRUMP: Okay, well, let me just tell you, this is the kind of a question I should have been asked. With me, Mika, I would be the best for women, the best for women’s health issues. BRZEZINSKI: The question is about equal pay. Republicans repeatedly voted against it. How would you get equal pay passed, and how would you enforce it? And the question of access to capital for women? TRUMP: Well, look, as far as questions like that, Mika, I’m not going to do it on the show. I don’t want to discuss it in the show. I want to discuss those questions at a debate and save them for a debate, but all I can say on women’s issues and women’s health issues, there will be nobody better than Donald Trump. But I’ll come out with policy on that and make on the future. I just don’t want to discuss it now. He first misunderstands the question and then declines to answer it, saying that he’ll ”come out with policy” on it and he wants to ”save it for a debate.” A cynic might think that someone hearing Trump’s initial offering, perhaps a longtime friend of Trump’s with some experience in politics heard Trump’s initial response and gently suggested that he appear on ”Morning Joe” again to take another swing at it. Especially since Trump whiffed on the question in a CNN interview with Chris Cuomo on Aug. 11. CUOMO: You said I’m going to be great for women. I will do the most that can be done for women. Will you pass an equal pay? You know the statistics. You know, they don’t get paid what men do? TRUMP: I’m looking into that very strongly. I was asked that question yesterday. I’m looking into it very strongly. I will have a position on it in the not too distant future. Trump explained how his company worked and how equal pay wasn’t as easy as it sounds. TRUMP: I have many women executives. I always have. When I was back in the construction days, the big construction days, I had women in charge of big developments. CUOMO: Do you pay them what you pay the men? TRUMP: I was very, very   many years ago. They are incredible executives. They are incredible executives. I get the picture better than anybody. CUOMO: Do you pay them the same as men? TRUMP: I will make a decision soon. CUOMO: Do you pay the women at the top of your organization the same way you pay the men? TRUMP: Yes, I do, absolutely. That’s not the case on his campaign, by the way. In a forum on Nov. 19, Trump seemed to abandon the clarity that Scarborough had seized upon. TRUMP: Here’s the problem. If you start getting involved with government on, this one gets this pay and this one gets that pay, then you say, where does it all start? Because you could have a woman that’s much better than a man; you could have a woman that’s not as good as a man. If you just sort of say, everyone gets equal pay, you get away from the whole American dream, you get away from capitalism in a sense. His campaign website makes no mention of equal pay policy proposals. What Hillary Clinton says: Her campaign has a page focusing on the subject and offering several solutions, including raising the minimum wage and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Affordable child care What Donald Trump says: Trump’s website makes no mention of child care either. At a town hall event last November, Trump tackled the topic. Our Jenna Johnson reported on his response. ”It’s not expensive for a company to do it,” Trump said during a town hall at a community college in this small town on Thursday afternoon. ”You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys. You know, surely, it’s not expensive. It’s not an expensive thing. I do it all over, and I get great people because of it. ... It’s something that can be done, I think, very easily by a company.” What Hillary Clinton says: In May, Clinton unveiled a plan to expand access to child care, including proposing a cap on   costs. Paid family leave What Donald Trump says: CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about it in September. TAPPER: You have said that you would be far better on women’s issues than the likely Democratic candidate, nominee, Hillary Clinton. Let me ask you about one specific policy that she’s talking about on the trail. She’s obviously trying to draw a contrast between herself and Republicans. Do you think the federal government should require businesses to provide paid family leave, or do you think that’s an unfair mandate? TRUMP: We’re going to be releasing a policy on it over the next three to four weeks, Jake. And we’re working on it right now. No policy was released. What Hillary Clinton says: She supports it. During her speech, Ivanka Trump pointed out that she ”[does] not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote on based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country.” If the policies above are her priorities, and if the Republican who gave those interviews to MSNBC and CNN didn’t share her last name, it’s fair to wonder which party Ivanka Trump would back in 2016.

"Why mammograms haven’t cut cancer deaths, explained in 500 words.  October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, and with the flurry of pink ribbons comes new studies about the harms and benefits of mammograms for   screening. Every year, confusion ensues.    The whole idea behind cancer screening is that it can help find the disease earlier  —   even before symptoms appear. With early   detection, doctors should, in theory, be more likely to successfully treat the disease and control any spread.            But as this chart, from the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, shows, the introduction of mass mammography screening  —   for all women over the age of 40  —   has failed to deliver on this promise. Despite widespread screening programs, incidences of metastatic cancers (or   cancers that have already spread and are therefore more deadly) have remained stubbornly stable since 1975.    Meanwhile, the rate of finding small (”invasive”) tumors has increased by 30 percent.    This gets at the heart of the controversy about   screening. If mass mammography was a total   success, we’d see the red line for metastatic cancer drop at the same time the blue line for small cancers rises. Instead, researchers increasingly worry, mammography has failed to reduce illness and death in women with   disease. Conversely, more women with tumors that may have never advanced to anything serious are undergoing difficult, costly procedures like surgery and chemotherapy.    This is far from the first time researchers have questioned the effects of mass mammography. A 2015 study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found more breast cancer screening didn’t actually save lives. It did however lead to more ”overdiagnosis”  —   detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful. In more than 500 US counties, that study found, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers  —   but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening). So, again, more patients and treatments, but not fewer deaths.             While this means mass mammography programs targeting all women may be delivering more harms than benefits and should therefore be reconsidered, it doesn’t mean no one should get screened.    Right now, health groups offer different advice about when women should start annual screening. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has some of the most aggressive guidance, recommending age 40 as the start time. Meanwhile, the US Preventive Services Task Force  —   an   group that governments and insurers usually follow  —   suggests screening every two years starting at age 50. So the decision is really left to women and their individual values, preferences, and risks. Those with a family history of the disease, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, or habits like smoking may consider initiating screening sooner. Those who don’t may consider waiting. Doctors can also help patients by more often explaining both the harms and risks of mammography and factors that contribute to their individual   risk profiles. ",-1.0
"His mom publicly compared him to killer Adam Lanza. Now the teen is opening up about his bipolar disorder..      “My name is Eric Walton,” the teenager said, standing center stage at the April 2 Tedx Boise event. “At the age of 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after my mom wrote a slightly unimportant blog post that went viral on the internet.   …     She said that she was the mother of a child with a mental illness. A few days later I got the diagnosis. ” It was during Eric’s fourth hospitalization, a byproduct of the rages and tantrums that defined his childhood, when a man on the other side of the country murdered his mother and then massacred first graders at a Connecticut elementary school. The unfathomable tragedy shook Liza Long, who immediately thought of her own son currently sedated in a psychiatric ward. It could have been him. It could have been her. That night she wrotethe provocative blog post “I am Adam Lanza’s Mother. ” “I live with a son who is mentally ill. I love my son. But he terrifies me,” she wrote. When she visited her son in the hospital the day after her post published, they discussed it. He asked her why she would compare him to a “serial killer. ” He was hurt and confused. She explained that his hardships were similar to Lanza’s, and that she was scared. She used a fake name, “Michael,” to protect her son’s identity, but she’d shared her own.    Shortly after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, LIza Long wrote a blog post titled, ”I am Adam Lanza’s Mother,” in which she opened up about her fears of and for her son who battled mental illness. In this Dec. 2013 interview, she addressed her viral post. (  Idaho Public Television)   When the post went viral, Long intensified her advocacy for greater mental health awareness, but her son remained relatively anonymous, turning down TV interviews and other press as he concentrated on his recovery. A   psychiatrist had seen Long’s blog post and quickly identified the symptoms she’d described as consistent with bipolar disorder. She and Eric flew east together, and the doctor prescribed lithium, the most common and effective drug for managing bipolar. Now, after a decade of misdiagnoses and failed medications, of overnights in hospitals and juvenile jails, her son is in control of his own mind. And, after more than three years without incident, he is ready to also be in control of his own story.    Eric Walton. (Courtesy of Liza Long)  At the Tedx talk, Eric, 16, described a childhood beset with inexplicable anger and uncontrollable outbursts. When he was a toddler, doctors told his parents he’d grow out of it. In kindergarten he’d tear through his classroom in such a rage that teachers had to send the rest of the class out of the room for their safety as if it were a fire drill. His own family had a similar drill  —   his siblings would lock themselves in the car when Eric fumed. Doctors diagnosed him with autism, then attention deficit disorder, then something called intermittent explosive disorder. Each new illness came with a new batch of drugs whose side effects were vast  —   weight gain, lethargy, blurred vision. But they didn’t calm his violent urges. He was hospitalized for the first time when he was 9 years old. His first time in jail was around his 11th birthday, when his parents called the police on him after he attacked his father. “The only way to get help was to charge your child with a crime,” Eric said during his talk. “So that’s what my parents did. They charged me with battery. ” He recalled shivering under two   blankets in the tiny cell. He wasn’t cold, he said. He was trembling from fear. An estimated 70 percent of kids that cycle through the juvenile justice systems have a mental health condition, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. About half of all kids with a mental illness didn’t receive any treatment the year prior.   [Reflecting on her own illness after watching two documentaries on bipolar disorder]   The final time Eric was hospitalized was December 2012. He was 13 and strong enough now to hurt someone in his rage  —   this latest over what color pants to wear to school. It was that same week Lanza attacked Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 students and six adults. Long thought about Eric’s violent tendencies and threats to hurt himself or others. “The reason I decided to write it was people were really judging Nancy Lanza and I wanted to put a face on it. So go ahead and judge me because I’m going through it too and I’m trying,” she said in an interview. There were consequences. Her two younger children were ordered in a family court to go live with their father for their safety. Some questioned whether she should have aired her child’s troubles so publicly. But it led to Eric’s accurate diagnosis and it made her part of a larger community of mental health advocates. Its “an unintentional calling,” she said. Eric is now back in mainstream school after being placed for two years in a special school for kids with anger issues. He has real friends, after a lonely childhood of isolation from his peers. He’s planning for college, where he wants to study psychology or physics. He loves to write and watch “Star Trek”  —   “hard core nerd,” he called it  —   and he joined a fencing club. Eric, in an interview, said it was after his second week at his new school without an outburst that he realized the medication worked. But recovery doesn’t mean complacency, and Eric knows his stability is something he’ll have to work on for the rest of his life. He’ll always be on the medication. He meditates nightly. He practices mindfulness. “I have to be aware of my surroundings,” he said, “and know my limits. ” “It’s not just the lithium, it was the diagnosis.

"Trump is reportedly eager to use his nuclear option on Obamacare.  Obamacare’s biggest challenge right now has nothing to do with the uncertain Republican bid to repeal and replace it. It’s President Trump’s threats to undermine obscure but important payments that help millions of Americans afford their health care.    The Affordable Care Act has aided millions in purchasing private health insurance through billions of dollars of federal spending. Much of that is in the form of tax credits, which reduce the premiums that many people pay every month for their coverage. A   piece of the law helps make health care even more affordable for   people:   reductions, or CSRs, which help make copays and deductibles cheaper for people who got insurance through Obamacare.  Right now those subsidies are facing a huge threat. Trump can try to cut off those payments, which would disrupt Obamacare’s insurance markets and maybe cause them to collapse entirely. And Trump is threatening to do just that  —   he could end the federal government’s defense of CSR payments in a lawsuit working its way through federal court.    In   Trump reportedly told his aides in an Oval Office meeting that he wanted to stop the payments, stepping up his threat to gut the law, according to Politico:    President Donald Trump has told advisers he wants to end payments of key Obamacare subsidies, a move that could send the health law’s insurance markets into a tailspin, according to several sources familiar with the conversations. So Obamacare isn’t out of the woods yet. Even if the law stays on the books, Trump and the Republicans who now control the federal government still have an opportunity to sabotage it or hold it hostage to try to force Democrats to compromise on a new health care plan. The   subsidies  —   an intricate part of the law nonetheless made vulnerable by a legal challenge  —   gave them that chance.    CSRs reduce health care costs for Americans with lower incomes Obamacare expanded health coverage for Americans in two major ways. It expanded Medicaid to cover poor adults making no more than 138 percent of the poverty line ($16, 000 for an individual). And for people who make more money than that but don’t get health coverage through their jobs, the law created marketplaces where those people could buy insurance. Insurers were required to sell plans to everyone, no matter their medical history, at similar prices, and to cover a range of “essential health benefits. ” But with those changes, it still would have been difficult for many people  —   both   and    —   to afford insurance, not to mention the deductibles and copays they’d have to pay to actually see a doctor or fill a prescription. So people buying through the marketplaces also get financial assistance. Federal tax credits help pay monthly premiums for anyone making up to 400 percent of the poverty line ($48, 000 for an individual).  People who earn too much for Medicaid but are still    —   up to 250 percent of the federal poverty line, about $30, 000 for one person  —   also got   reductions for their private insurance. The federal government makes those payments to the health insurer to lower the    costs, the deductible and copayments, that those people have to pay for their health care. The less money people make, the more help they receive.    More than half of people who buy individual insurance through Obamacare got this help. About 12 million people bought health insurance through Obamacare’s insurance markets this year, and 7 million of them qualified for CSRs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The impact can be dramatic: Somebody who doesn’t qualify for a CSR and buys a typical Obamacare plan could have to pay as much as $3, 609 for a deductible before her plan starts to cover her care. But a person who qualifies for the most generous CSR  —   whose income is at the poverty line or only a little above it  —   could have to pay only $255 before his coverage kicks in. Last year, CSR payments cost the federal government $7 billion, which means that, on average, CSRs lowered    costs by about $1, 000 for each person.         The goal of Obamacare was to make health coverage and care more affordable. Having an insurance card doesn’t do much good if you can’t actually afford whatever your plan requires you to pay. If you want everybody, no matter their income, to be able to purchase the same plans, you need some extra help for people making less money. CSRs were that extra help. They made the law work for the people buying insurance who would struggle the most to pay for their care. “You have to protect   people not just from high premiums but from high    costs,” Jonathan Gruber, an MIT professor who helped the Obama administration and congressional Democrats as they were designing the law, told me. There is one wrinkle in the law: Health plans are required to offer people under 250 percent of the poverty line a plan with smaller deductibles and copayments even if the federal government doesn’t give them any money at all. Without the CSR payments, though, that might not be workable for insurers  —   it would dramatically increase their costs. They would have to offer very generous coverage to those people without receiving any additional financial help from the government, and their likely recourse would be to hike premiums.    So the law also created the CSR payments that the federal government makes to plans, which allows the insurers’ financing to work without premiums skyrocketing. But House Republicans seized on an apparent legislative flaw to challenge the payments in court  —   and put the entire program at risk. A   lawsuit challenges the CSR payments Not long after Obamacare’s marketplaces opened for business in 2014, House Republicans filed a lawsuit that argued the   reduction payments being made by the Obama administration were illegal. It was a case that went to the core of the Constitution. The brains behind it, constitutional lawyers David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley, portrayed the stakes this way: The lawsuit is necessary to protect the Constitution’s separation of powers, a core means of protecting individual liberty. Without a judicial check on unbounded executive power to suspend the law, this president and all who follow him will have a powerful new weapon to destroy political accountability and democracy itself. The Constitution says Congress is responsible for deciding how the federal government’s money will be spent. House Republicans alleged that although Obamacare created the CSR payments, Congress still needed to approve them in a separate spending bill or as part of the bigger spending bills that lawmakers pass periodically to fund the entire government. Because Congress had not done so, the House alleged that the payments being made by the Obama administration starting in 2014 were unconstitutional.    The Obama administration argued that Obamacare had permanently funded the CSR payments and so did not need any additional authority from Congress to make the payments. It also argued that regardless of the facts of the case, the House didn’t actually have the ability to bring a case because it wasn’t harmed by the   reduction payments, a legal concept known as “standing. ” Some liberal legal experts said the House’s argument does have some merit. The text of the law did not unambiguously appropriate the CSR payments  —   and the Obama administration at one point, perhaps in recognition of that, had asked Congress to approve the spending. But others, including the architects of the law, dismissed it as a politically motivated attempt to undercut Obamacare. Many experts also believed that the House didn’t have standing to pursue the case in the first place. Rosemary Collyer, the judge hearing the case and a Republican appointee, first ruled in September 2015 that the House did in fact have standing to sue the administration over the payments. She sided with the House in May 2016, deciding that the CSR payments could not be made without further congressional approval.  However, she suspended the decision so that the Obama administration could appeal, allowing the payments to continue until the case is fully resolved. The Obama administration appealed the ruling in July 2016 to the US District Court of Appeals in Washington. But litigation moves slowly, and the case didn’t advance much.  Then in November, Donald Trump was elected president  —   and his government is now responsible for defending Obamacare, a law he has vowed to repeal and predicts will implode. The House asked the appeals court in December to postpone the lawsuit so that they and the newly elected administration could figure out what to do.  Cutting off CSR payments could throw the markets into chaos The CSR litigation might not have mattered as much if Republicans had coalesced around a health care plan in the early days of Trump’s presidency, as they attempted to do.     But Congress’s failure to pass the American Health Care Act in March brought the issue back into the foreground. This lawsuit gave them another chance to undercut the health care law, even without passing their own bill. Because if Obamacare is here to stay, then the fate of the CSR payments is now an essential question. So Trump could either choose to continue defending the CSR subsidies, making payments in the interim and keeping the markets stable  —   or he could decide to drop the suit, stop the payments, and precipitate a market implosion that could leave many vulnerable Americans without health coverage.  If the House prevailed, and the CSR payments were not paid, insurers would still be required to reduce cost sharing, but they would now have to do it without the government’s help. They would have to raise premiums dramatically to make up the lost revenue.         The irony is that if plans do raise premiums, the federal government would be on the hook for much of those costs. The government absorbs premium increases through the tax credits that help people afford coverage. The law is designed to keep premiums manageable for people, so it falls on the government to cover any excess increases. “It’s on the feds anyway,” as MIT’s Gruber told me. Or, perhaps more likely, plans could drop out of the market altogether. “If I were an insurer, I’d just take my marbles with me and focus on other more profitable lines of business,” Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation told me. Trump officials had been coy in discussing the lawsuit, but top House Republicans had indicated that the payments would continue. A statement from the US Department of Health and Human Services on April 10 seemed to suggest the same.    But then a few days later, Trump hinted in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he might get rid of the payments  —   something his administration could do by simply dropping its defense of the lawsuit. That would mean that the lower court’s ruling to stop the payments without congressional approval would stand. And if the payments stop, yes,   Americans would technically still be eligible for   plans  —   but many experts expect insurers would just pull out of the markets. That could lead to more areas with one or no plan available to people, a situation for which there is no remedy and which leaves people in those areas without any coverage. So Democrats tried to force Trump’s hand. They wanted to tie the CSR payments to a   government spending bill. The federal government was set to run out of money at the end of April. Republicans usually need some Democrats to vote for their spending bills, because they lose some of their own most conservative members and those bills need 60 votes in the Senate. That gives Democrats some negotiating leverage, even though they are out of power. In the days after Trump’s threat to stop the CSR payments, CNN and Politico reported that Democrats would demand that funding for the payments be included in the spending bill that must pass in the next few weeks to avoid a government shutdown. An aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the CSR funding should be permanent. Ultimately, the Democrats and Trump reached a detente, with the White House agreeing to administratively continue the payments.     But Trump’s renewed threat in May to stop the payments shows that he’s still ready to use them to threaten the health care law. Trump takes Obamacare hostage, but at his own risk Trump clearly sees the CSR payments as major leverage in the ongoing health care fight.  He told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats should be calling him, begging to work together on a health care plan, lest he drop the CSR lawsuit and let the payments lapse. He even worked behind the scenes to walk back the HHS statement that had suggested the payments would be made. But based on the available polling and comments from his own party, Trump has seriously misjudged his position. First and foremost: Americans would overwhelmingly blame Trump and Republicans if something went wrong with Obamacare, according to the best available surveys.         On top of that, some top House Republicans have said that the payments should be made, one way or another. From the New York Times:     Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said Thursday, “I will do everything I can to make sure that the   reduction payments get made. ” “That’s an obligation we have not only to the insurers,” but also to consumers who enrolled in plans under the health care law, Mr. Walden said. “We cannot leave them high and dry. ” Mr. Walden said his preference was for Congress to appropriate the money, about $7 billion a year. That is “the best legal way to do it,” he said.  The one thing Trump’s threat does do, though, is making insurers nervous. As Sarah Kliff reported recently, health plans are struggling to decide whether to stay in the law’s marketplaces, because they don’t yet know what’s going to happen to the CSR payments. Trump’s rhetoric could help destabilize the markets on its own  —   though, again, he may end up taking the blame. So Trump has made his threat to Obamacare, the result of this long history that gave him that opportunity. But he appears to be holding the metaphorical gun to his own head. ",-1.0

"GOP leaders urge patience — not panic — amid Trump’s early stumbles.  More Americans disapprove than approve of President Trump’s job performance. His White House is in a perpetual state of turmoil. Fellow Republicans control Congress, but no signature legislation has passed. And in   Kansas last week, the Republican candidate in a special election got a scare from a turbocharged Democratic base, winning a House seat by a far slimmer margin than expected.  For a Republican Party already starting to strategize ahead of next year’s midterm elections, the turbulent, inchoate environment as the Trump presidency nears its   mark could be a cause for concern or even alarm. Yet party leaders and strategists are preaching patience, not panic. These Republicans  —   who acknowledge that their political brand will be shaped by the 45th president as long as he holds office  —   say their political fortunes will be told over the next year and a half in the answers to two overriding questions: Does Trump project strength? And does he achieve progress that amounts to more jobs and higher wages? “What matters is a record of accomplishment,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who has been conducting focus groups of Trump supporters. “People can disagree over the details or the significance of the change, but if you have a record of accomplishment, that fixes everything. . . . If you don’t, no rhetoric will fix it. ”   White House press secretary Sean Spicer answers questions from members of the media during the White House daily briefing on Feb. 14. (Jabin   Washington Post)  That view contrasts sharply with the conservative ideological projects inspired by some past Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and is part of an emerging recognition for the Grand Old Party that doctrines may not drive voters as much as selling changes Trump has made.  [Trump as a ‘conventional Republican’? That’s what some in GOP establishment say they see.]  Though Trump’s first three months in office have seen a flurry of activity, including adding conservative Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, he has no major legislative victory. Trump’s push to change the Affordable Care Act  —   the   law Republicans have derided as Obamacare and campaigned to repeal and replace  —   collapsed in a humiliating defeat for Trump and the GOP leadership. The president who campaigned on his decades of real estate dealmaking and his vow that nobody could execute more “beautiful” deals in Washington is anxious to achieve, well, deals. “He’s realizing that the party will hang with him, but there are no guarantees and no easy paths forward,” said Ed Rollins, a longtime GOP strategist. “It’s got to kill them that they have the whole thing  —   the White House and Congress  —   and they can’t seem to get it together. ” Rep. Tom Cole ( .) was blunt: “We can’t blame this on Barack Obama. We have to look in the mirror. ” For congressional Republicans, the challenges are not necessarily overcoming a policy divide with Trump, but getting clear direction from the White House about the shape and scope of the agenda for the remainder of the year.   President Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch hugs his wife, Marie Louise, moments after being sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10. (Jabin   Washington Post)  On health care, there is a lingering concern that the conservative House Freedom Caucus remains a conundrum without an answer. On taxes, too, Republicans on Capitol Hill say they are perplexed by a lack of consensus on rates and how to address various deductions. It is not even clear to them who in the Trump administration  —   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn  —   is taking the lead, or whether House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( .) will eventually be called upon to craft a compromise. The ability of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) to guide Trump on policy is another unknown. With Ryan’s hand burned by the   defeat, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) who has an easy rapport with Trump, is rising as a potential new power broker.  [The ‘closer’? The inside story of how Trump tried  —   and failed  —   to make a deal on health care.]  What worries Republican leaders is the potent Trump resistance movement activated on the left. Consider last week’s results in Kansas. Trump carried the 4th Congressional District last fall by 27 percentage points, yet Republican Ron Estes won the special election for the open House seat by just seven percentage points over Democrat James Thompson, who was buoyed by a surge in his party’s turnout. Another special election this Tuesday presents a second test, this time in a suburban Atlanta district that is expected to be more competitive for Democrats than the one in Kansas. “Their base is whipped up and going,” Cole said of the Democrats. “Nothing we can do is going to change that. So you better have your own base equally charged up, and to do that you have to convince them that you’re getting things done  —   that the fact that they gave you the Senate, the House and the White House means something. ” In his quest for legislative wins on such issues as tax reform and infrastructure spending, Trump is signaling a desire to broker with Democrats, although outreach has been scattered and no bipartisan alliance has emerged. In the past week alone, Trump reversed several positions in conflict with his campaign promises. He said that he now supports NATO and the   Bank, and that he no longer believes China is manipulating its currency. Trump’s new stances reflect the rising influence of a bloc of     advisers at the expense of Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist and champion of Trump’s nationalist ideas and pugilistic tactics. The shifts have fueled the perception that the president is evolving into a more traditional Republican. “The question is: Will he continue to engage his populism and his outsider status?” asked Patrick J. Caddell, a political consultant and Bannon friend. “What is his organizing principle? It has long been overthrowing and changing the system, protecting people and taking on institutions. If he abandons those kinds of ideas, then what is he all about?”  [Inside Bannon’s struggle: From ‘shadow president’ to Trump’s marked man]  Strategists who are counseling Republican leaders and candidates in the 2018 midterms said most voters may not care, for instance, whether Trump labels China a currency manipulator. What matters, they said, is whether the Republicans in charge can work together to get results. “People were voting for change,” said David Winston, a GOP pollster. “It doesn’t have to be everything all the time, but there has to be a sense of forward progress. They’re looking for two basic outcomes: more jobs and higher wages. It’s pretty straightforward. ” Austin Barbour, a Republican strategist based in Mississippi, said, “Trump voters see him not for the policy stances that he takes. It has to be a really big single issue to get their attention. Most of them think, he’s not Barack Obama and he’s a straight shooter who will always say what’s on his mind and he says he’ll make the country a better place. ” Trump’s first three months in office have not been without action. He has signed a slew of executive orders. His Cabinet is working to loosen regulations throughout the bureaucracy. He has pressured business leaders and sought to take credit for thousands of new manufacturing jobs, although most were already in the works. Trump also has reimagined America’s posture in the world. He has won accolades from many Republicans and some Democrats for a bombing strike in Syria, dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Islamic State forces in Afghanistan, toughening his administration’s approach to Russia and cultivating a rapport with the leaders of China and Japan amid rising tensions with North Korea. Some Trump allies say he must stay true to his promise of wholesale change to maintain his political currency. “They’re in power because people reacted to the options that were presented and went with the party that seemed to be more like change,” Caddell said. “There is no deep support for the GOP. They remain an unpopular party, and people are very dissatisfied, which is why Trump is sitting in the White House. If the Republicans don’t recognize that, our politics will move on from them. ” ",-0.5
"A Trump presidency would be ethically compromised.    Richard Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota, was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007. Norman Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama from 2009 to 2011.          As government ethics lawyers who have, respectively, counseled the most recent Republican president and the most recent Democratic one, we have watched Donald Trump’s campaign with increasing concern. We have come to believe a Trump presidency would be ethically compromised for the following reasons:     Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine said on Sept. 14 that he’s concerned about Donald Trump’s overseas business interests, especially in Russia. (Peter   Washington Post)    Opacity. Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns shields critical information about his finances that is not found in the basic details he is required to provide on his candidate financial disclosure. For example, his disclosure form does not cover his tax deductions and exemptions and any loopholes he takes advantage of; each represents a policy issue on which he has a potential conflict. To take another example, how much tax is Trump paying or sheltering domestically vs. in foreign jurisdictions? That needs to be known to ascertain which nations Trump has financial ties to and where he may be susceptible to pressure. Absent this information, it is impossible to assess the potential conflicts a President Trump would face in making decisions.  Lack of divestment. Trump has said that if elected he would have his children manage his business and would not discuss business matters with them. That is not sufficient. Presidents for the past   have either converted assets to simple,   holdings such as U. S. government bonds, adopted blind trusts or done both. Blind trusts were used by Presidents Reagan, Carter, both Bushes and Bill Clinton, none of whom had holdings comparable to the size and complexity of the Trump empire. A true blind trust means that your holdings are liquidated and placed in new investments unknown to you by an independent trustee who manages them free of familial or other bias. Trump has so far declined to commit to taking those steps, and doing so would not be easy for him even if he agreed. A large number of Trump businesses are branded with his name as an integral part of their value. Even if ownership were placed in trust, Trump and everyone else would remain well aware of these assets. Assumption of the presidency requires a much more definitive break than Trump has, so far, been willing to make.  Domestic conflicts. Without considerable additional detail about Trump’s finances, we cannot be sure his decisions on domestic matters would be  . When Trump nominated his Cabinet, offered his budget and invited people to White House meetings, would he be choosing with an eye toward his or his family’s business interests? Moreover, based on what we do know, there is ample cause for concern about conflicts. Take the example of bank regulation. Trump’s   holdings appear to be heavily leveraged. That means that his businesses, like those of many in the   field, are beholden to banks. It is not fanciful to question whether that would affect the Trump administration’s attitude toward regulation of banks and other lenders.  Foreign conflicts. Even more serious are the questions raised by Trump investments abroad. Those relate to some of the United States’ most important  —   and most sensitive  —   relationships, among them ones with Russia, China, India, South Korea and Turkey. When the United States must support or confront those nations, or their adversaries, would Trump act to benefit the national interest, or his and his family’s investments? Moreover, who are the foreign individuals with whom he has had financial ties, and how would those relationships affect his decisions? As the electorate considers those questions, it is entitled to more information.   Legal exposure. Because of Trump’s seeming unwillingness to set up a true blind trust, and the difficulty of his doing so, his potential foreign conflicts could raise immediate legal issues. Most federal ethics rules, surprisingly, do not apply to the president. But Trump would be covered by bribery laws and the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which broadly prohibits the president from accepting gifts “from any King, Prince, or foreign State. ” The emoluments clause has been interpreted by the Justice Department to include any payment from a foreign government, except with the consent of Congress. Every time there was a financial transaction between a foreign government  —   or a company controlled by a foreign government  —   and any Trump entity, there would be a potential for favorable treatment that could violate this limitation, as well as the   laws. That, too, gives us pause.   Veracity. Finally, we must address Trump’s propensity for dishonesty. It is disturbing that just 15 percent of his statements checked by PolitiFact are “true” or “mostly true. ” No ethics program can work if the client is not honest.  To be sure, counsel for a President Hillary Clinton would have to address actual or apparent conflicts posed by the Clinton Foundation, but those have been disclosed and publicly vetted. They are nowhere near as obscure, profound and dangerous as Trump’s. The ethics lawyer who would have President Trump as his or her client would face a far more daunting task than either of us  —   or any of our colleagues in recent years  —   has ever confronted.      Speaking in Kenansville, N. C. Sept. 20, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he often uses “other people’s money” in his business dealings.

"Silicon Valley Still Doesn't Care About Work-Life Balance. Silicon Valley’s emphasis on work-life balance may be evolving, but its priesthood still values a very particular kind of grit. This ideological tension came to blows earlier this week in a marathon Twitter fight that started on Memorial Day, with anecdotal evidence and closing arguments still trickling in days later. The dialogue began innocently enough when Blake Robbins, a tech investor who has worked or interned for companies like Google, Nest, and SpaceX, deployed a flurry of tweets about his philosophy on work-life balance. “When I first got into tech. I thought it was ‘cool’ to work on the weekends or holidays. I quickly realized that's a recipe for disaster,” Robbins wrote. “Not hanging with friends and family because you're working isn't ‘cool.’ Burning out isn't ‘cool.’ I promise you...your competition isn't beating you because they are working more hours than you.

"My nine days as the most fabulous drag queen on the internet. “You look like a car crash,” Trixie Mattel told me. She wasn’t wrong. About two days prior, I had decided to become a working drag queen. Those 37 hours had not been kind. I’d somehow booked some gigs at a local club, thank God, but visually speaking, I was a complete and total mess. It didn’t have to be this way. I had a sizable wad of cash to spend on my very first look. But when I finally assembled all of the   new additions to my growing drag closet, I realized I was in trouble. I’d blown most of my money on a sleeveless,    kelly green gown with gold trim and an empire waist  —   a Hail Mary that ended up being more of an “Oh, Mary   …     no. ” It had pleats.  I paired it with some   ankle wedges the color of tartar sauce and a seafoam green wig with a heavy bang. I think I was going for some kind of “Other Boleyn Girl” vibe by way of seapunk? Citation needed from head to toe. After picking up those pieces, I only had enough money left to buy some blush. No foundation. No lipstick. No eyeliner. No lashes. No nails. Just blush. “u started with blush,” my friend texted me after I sent her a photo. “bless u. ” I should clarify something: I wasn’t actually doing drag irl. That series of Choices I just described all took place within the world of “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” a new mobile game that hit app stores on Feb. 23. It’s the brainchild of BibleGirl666, one of New York’s rising drag stars, who has developed an impressive, near “RuPaul’s Drag Race”  cult following on   and   despite having never appeared on the hit reality show herself. The game mixes casual   with light   elements as you follow your character on the road to drag superstardom. It’s a long road with plenty of level grinding and  —   unless you’re really good at assessing your needs and making fabulous   decisions for yourself  —   lots of   bodycon dresses along the way. But it makes for a fun distraction in   or   spurts while waiting for the train or for your   broccoli and bean curd to finish frying. The game also gives a small peek into just how much work goes into being a professional nightlife entertainer, the hours and hours of unseen labor that goes into making every     “Into You” lip sync at your local gay bar look absolutely effortless. ‘u started with blush,’ my friend texted me after I sent her a photo. ‘bless u.’ BibleGirl describes her drag aesthetic as being a little bit “TRL” Britney meets a little bit   Rihanna, with a heavy dose of   sprinkled throughout. It’s that latter inspiration that’s most apparent in “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” which feels a whole lot like Kim’s   mobile game, “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” as well as Kendall and Kylie’s aptly titled “Kendall and Kylie. ” According to Bible, that similarity is far from coincidental. “I remember reading a bunch of articles back when the Kim K. game came out, about how it really boosted her net worth, and I thought, ‘Hey! ’” Bible said. “My boyfriend, Chris, and I saw how drag was starting to evolve as an industry. It was becoming a real market to tap into. ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ found a way to do that through TV, and I wanted to see if I could do that through another medium, like video games. ” The story of “BibleGirl’s Big Apple” begins at New York’s hottest club: Port Authority. Your character has just arrived in the city from an unnamed corner of   America. They’re greeted by the local welcoming committee  —   a guy who tries to steal your bag  —   only to be saved by BibleGirl herself. Good thing she just happened to be hanging around a mostly deserted bus depot at 4 in the morning. “I’m a regular,” the game’s namesake and creator joked over coffee at Onieals, a restaurant and bar in downtown New York City. The actual BibleGirl  —   Bible for short, BibleGirl666 for    —   is a few years out from her own drag origin story, which involved neither a   nor a trip to Port Authority. Born and raised in Tampa before finishing high school on Long Island, Bible moved to New York City in 2011 to study womenswear fashion design at FIT. Her design taste proved controversial among students and teachers. “Friends of mine kept trying to have these ‘come to Jesus’ moments with me, like, ‘You need to get your s —  t together! ’” she said. “They didn’t get what I was doing. ” She loved the work of revered designers like Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood, but she also loved what she called the “stuff that shouldn’t be fashion but is” like the crop tops and   jeans falling off the bodies of   pop stars. Eventually, she dropped out. Drag sisterhood plays a vital role in ‘BibleGirl’s Big Apple.’ She got into drag through straight nightlife, weirdly enough, or what straight people would just call “nightlife. ” Then still known solely by the name of her    self, Zachary Gottlieb, Bible worked as a club promoter and table host at venues like Avenue and the Dream Downtown. She used Halloween 2013 as an excuse to try drag out in public for the first time. It stuck. After a few more months of dragging up the straight club scene in Manhattan, she booked her first major opportunity across the Williamsburg Bridge. It was at Bizarre Bushwick, a sizable bar just off that     intersection with Mr. Kiwi’s on one side and that one deli with the pretty chandeliers on the other. Excitement turned to anxiety when Bible realized that her  ’s ex, a performer named   was also slated to perform. But the two immediately struck up a friendship, and, like a scene out of some “First Wives Club” fan fiction where the first and second wives realize they’re cool with each other and just hang out and have a good time, a sisterhood was formed. Through this friendship and many others, Bible found opportunities to perform all over Brooklyn and the Lower East Side. Drag sisterhood plays a vital role in “BibleGirl’s Big Apple” as well. Once Bible rescues your character from the   Port Authority mugging, she finds a place for you to stay (an empty room in her apartment) a job (a nightlife clothing and wig store) and a nightly gig at a local club. This kind of support was hugely important when Bible first got going, she told me. There was no doubt in her mind that she wanted to incorporate it into the game in some way. “That whole idea of ‘catching more flies with honey’ is the best way to work within the drag industry,” Bible said. “Anyone can be a friend. Anyone can be an ally. I’ve made the mistake of thinking there’s this hierarchy among queens when there isn’t. All of us drag queens come from a background of being bullied or being weird, so we should be building our community to support each other and not shutting anybody out. ” The game’s scope is somewhat limited right now. From an overworld map of New York City, you can pop in and out of three different locations: the apartment you share with Bible, where you can rest and recharge your health; the boutique where you work and have the opportunity to buy new pieces for your drag wardrobe and play a     game; and the club, where you perform onstage by way of a Simon     for tips. At the store and the boutique, you’ll be treated to the occasional cameo from “RuPaul’s Drag Race” alums like Thorgy Thor and Alaska Thunderf —  k 5000 and popular queens from beyond the world of “Drag Race” like Lucy Stoole, Lisa Limbaugh and Rubberchild. There’s also an   integration with Hot Topic where players can order shirts from the drag apparel website BibleGirl runs called  . That’s it for now, but Bible promises there are expansion packs on the way. Some of these will take your character to new cities, like Chicago and Las Vegas. One in particular will let you “ . ” Players can spend actual money through their iTunes store account to buy pricier clothing for their avatar faster, but as someone who opted to earn cash the honest way  —   catching wigs with a wig head in a mini game  —   it did not significantly impact my experience. I knew I’d only have a limited amount of time to play “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” so I incorporated that limitation into my character by naming her Nineday Queen. (It’s also a reference to one of my Tudor history faves, Lady Jane Grey, whose backstory was coincidentally   on a recent episode of “Stuff You Missed in History Class. ”) But those nine days of being a queen  —   or at least a virtual approximation of one  —   gave me a lot of time to think about all the things we don’t see when we watch a queen   to Mariah’s 1991 whistle register, nailing the illusion of hitting those notes far better than even Ms. Carey herself has in recent televised performances. It took me a lot of regrettable   purchases to finally land on a look I can proudly text my friends. (A       white dress with a    slit down the side has buried my pleated green nightmare once and for all.) I can only imagine how taxing  —   financially, spiritually, physically, emotionally  —   that process of trial and error is for the real drag queens out there. ‘Maybe you’re underage. Maybe you’re not out of the closet. Maybe you’re somewhere without a thriving drag scene. My game gives you a way to live out that fantasy.’ Here are some tips to avoid “look[ing] like a car crash” straight from BibleGirl herself: Focus on buying separates so you can mix and match and make exponentially more looks; buy larger sizes and learn to tailor clothes down yourself; clean your wigs; invest in toeless nylons; get to know sites that carry larger shoes like  ; know the words to the songs you perform; accept the fact that you’re probably going to fall down a lot; and watch as many makeup tutorials on YouTube as you possibly can. As for the   queens who download “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” its creator hopes that her game might inspire them to put down the phone, turn off their TiVo’d episodes of “Drag Race”  —   which returns with Season 9 later this month  —   and see what kind of drag shows are going down at their local gay bars. “Maybe you’re underage. Maybe you’re not out of the closet. Maybe you’re somewhere without a thriving drag scene. My game gives you a way to live out that fantasy,” Bible told me. “But there’s a reality to that fantasy that you can actually go out and experience. There’s a drag show every night in New York City. Support your local girls. The budgets aren’t that big for all the girls working, so every head in the room counts. ”",1.0

A study of child injury deaths in New York City revealed a   fact: homicides accounted for nearly one half of the fatalities among   and   .   related killings accounted for 29 of the 62 deaths among the young tots between 2010 and 2014, according to the analysis by the city  . Only 23 were unintentional  —   such as from a car accidents. The cause of death couldn’t be determined in 10 other cases. Over the past year, the city has been shocked by child killings, particularly   allegedly by the hands of his mother’s boyfriend.

Of the total, 61  —   31 percent  —   were homicides. About half of the deaths  —   104  —   were unintentional.   deaths were the major cause. Suicides accounted for 27 percent of injury deaths among kids aged 9 to 12 years (13 out of 49). Black children and kids in high poverty neighborhoods had the highest death rates. “While deaths among the children are rare in New York City, any death of a child is a tragedy,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett. “The continued excess rates in communities of color and among children living in poverty are unacceptable.

"How human beings evolved from this disgusting creature. Meet the Saccorhytus, your oldest ancestor and your newest nightmare. This week a team of paleontologists described a new link in the chain of human evolution  —   and it isn’t pretty. With its “  body,” “prominent mouth” and no anus (it likely excreted waste from openings by its mouth, almost like primitive gills) the Saccorhytus looks like it crawled off the set of “Alien,” but researchers say the   organism is a key early branch off our tree of life. A     fossil of the Saccorhytus was discovered in sedimentary rock in central China, according to a paper published in Nature magazine. The creatures are a primitive example of a deuterostome, a common ancestor to a wide range of animals from starfish to humans. “We think that as an early deuterostome this may represent the primitive beginnings of a very diverse range of species, including ourselves,” University of Cambridge professor Simon Conway Morrisone, who helped author the paper, told the BBC. “All deuterostomes had a common ancestor, and we think that is what we are looking at here. ” The news sent waves of excitement through the field of paleontology. “Finding and describing fossils is a critical way that we understand the history of life, and this is an important find,” Matthew I. Palmer, professor of ecology, evolution and biology at Columbia University, told The Post. “The evolutionary tree is long with lots of branches. This fossil illuminates the base of a branch (on which we happen to sit) but there are lots of branches both below and above it. ” This begs the question: How did we get from that to where we are today? Here, we trace our evolutionary journey from Saccorhytus to Homo sapiens with a few twists in between  …     This   animal  —   a primitive example of a deuterostome, a common ancestor of humans and many other animals  —   was all mouth. It likely lived among grains of sand at the bottom of the sea and inhaled particles into its giant orifice, expelling waste and water through lateral slits in its side (which researchers say may be early gills). The recent fossil discovery, researchers say, illuminates the story of our earliest evolution. They suggest that Saccorhytus had a symmetrical body  —   a trait inherited by many of its descendants, including humans. They also claim the animal had a thin, somewhat flexible skin and muscles, which helped it to wriggle to move around. These prehistoric “ ” fish (their heads and thoraxes were covered with natural armor) are the earliest known species with a modern jaw  —   a huge step forward, because this made them into predators. Placodermi lived in fresh and marine water in all continents except South America. Though most were small, some placoderms reached   long. They are also the first fish to develop pelvic fins, a precursor to legs. The    Ichthyostega was one of the first terrestrial tetrapods, or   vertebrae that amphibians, birds and mammals descend from. It had lungs, gills and digits on each limb that allowed the animal to easily navigate outside the water  —   a place that at the time was safer than the sea because there were fewer predators. It is seen as a transitional fossil that connects fish and other   animals. The Cynodonts  —   described by some researchers as     and covered in fur  —   are the closest relatives of mammals. They had larger brains, a lower jaw and teeth. The Cynodonts survived the greatest mass extinction of all time (which wiped out 70 percent of all marine organisms and 90 percent of all terrestrial animals) and thrived in the aftermath.   The best way to describe these first primates is:  . These     animals lived in Northern America and likely colonized Europe through a land bridge via Greenland. The Plesiadapis had mobile limbs, strong and curved claws, and a long, bushy tail  —   well adapted for climbing trees.   These are the first hominids, or the common ancestor of humans and other great apes. These apes had special adaptations for climbing trees including a stiff lower spine, a wide, flat rib cage, and flexible wrists. Fossils were only recently discovered in Spain in 2004 and the great ape got its name from the village where the remains were found.   The Australopithecus afarensis is one of the most   early humans  —   more than 300 remains have been uncovered, including the famous Lucy skeleton. These humans were spread out in Eastern Africa and survived nearly a million years. Physically they resemble a mix of ape and human  —   with a protruding lower jaw and a small brain, and with long curved fingers perfect for climbing.   Known as the “upright man,” this modern human spread out widely across the globe  —   including in South Africa, Kenya, Spain and China  —   and lived from about 2 million years ago to 100, 000 years ago (overlapping with Homo sapiens). They were about as big as us and had similar limb and torso proportions as well as opposable thumbs. Researchers believe that they walked on two feet and had much bigger brains than predecessors (though only about 60 percent the size of our brains).  Our fellow man showed up around 200, 000 years ago in Africa. Like other humans, we gathered and hunted, but unlike other humans, we had lighter skeletal structures, smaller teeth and much bigger brains. To accommodate such bigger brains our faces changed  —   foreheads flattened and we lost the heavy brow ridges of our forebears. But we’re not done adapting just yet! Time will tell how our dependency on technology will change us even further, as many researchers believe it will.",1.0
"April the giraffe finally had her baby. It’s a boy..

The park plans to hold a   contest shortly after birth, according to Hollywood Life.      April the giraffe gave birth to a calf on April 15 at Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, N. Y.

This is April’s fourth pregnancy, and it was not much different from the previous three until February, when someone reported her live feed to YouTube for “sexually explicit” content. YouTube briefly took the feed down. It became   after being restored, with people tuning in for hours at a time to avoid any chance of missing a birth that was expected first in March, then early April. April’s popularity didn’t go unnoticed. In March, Toys ‘R’ Us started sponsoring the feed and has its logo on the stream, according to Forbes. Animal Adventure Park even has an online destination that sells April the giraffe merchandise, including totes,   and onsies. The park started a GoFundMe campaign in late February, stating that “funds generated will be used to offset their annual care at our facility.  Anything generated, above and beyond the goal, will be dedicated to improvements of the new Giraffe Encounter Deck,” according to the page.

"What we can learn from Bernie Sanders’s Iowa voters.  Bernie Sanders’s strong showing in Iowa  —   where he lost to Hillary Clinton by a hair  —   gives his supporters a lot to be excited about, including the overwhelming support of young voters and evidence that he is a viable candidate for the Democratic nomination.    But experts say little in Sanders’s performance Monday night suggested that he could beat Clinton to the ultimate nomination or that he is   Barack Obama’s 2008 general electoral coalition, said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College. ”I’m sure the Sanders people are putting on a bright face  —   and, from one perspective, they should,” Dickinson said. ”But deep down, if you’re expecting Sanders to replicate the Obama revolution, you have to be disappointed with Iowa.” Sanders’s campaign has banked on capturing enthusiasm for its candidate in the heavily white, heavily liberal states that vote first. Once those primaries punctured Clinton’s sense of inevitability, the idea went, Sanders would be able to expand his support to nonwhite and less liberal voters.    But the first part of this strategy didn’t really materialize in Iowa, in part because he didn’t win outright and in part because voters didn’t really show up for Sanders in the same numbers as they did for Obama in 2008, according to Dickinson.    (In 2008, 239, 000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucuses compared with about 170, 000 last night.) ”Nothing I’ve said precludes the possibility that Sanders will initiate an   revolution, but I just didn’t see it last night,” Dickinson said. ”If you thought he was inciting this revolution, you’d like to see higher turnout.”    Could Sanders be building something more durable than Obama did in 2008? Sanders may not be   Obama’s electoral coalition. But he could be opening up a fundamentally different kind of fault line in the Democratic Party  —   one that cleaves the party along ideological lines. ”What’s distinctive about this campaign, much more than Obama’s, is that Sanders is staking a position further left of any other candidate and using language that’s further left,” said Jedediah Purdy, a Duke University law professor who has written several books on American political identity. Sanders’s embrace of a distinctive ideological message, Purdy said, suggests he can build a political movement that doesn’t have to mirror Obama’s to have real power.    ”The   question  —   the key one for the Sanders campaign  —   is whether people who are supporting him have some picture,   about his language and about socialism and a fair economy,” Purdy says. ”Do they actually represent some potential for a lasting voting bloc? Or are people thinking something about the moment but not consolidating it into their priorities?” There’s evidence that it’s the substance of Sanders’s message that’s resonating with voters. And if that’s the case, Purdy said, Sanders’s insurgent campaign may in a way prove to have even more of an impact than Obama’s in the long run. ”If that’s the case, this campaign has built a lasting constituency whether or not they win this year,” Purdy said. ”Obama didn’t do that, because ultimately that campaign was about his extraordinary charisma and the kind of thinking that it would be possible to become  .” Purdy added that Obama’s 2008 campaign ”was a movement, but ultimately it was a personality movement. It didn’t turn out to have the substance of realignment behind it.” ",-1.0

"In case of apocalypse, Arctic ‘Doomsday Vault’ can regrow food supply. Humanity’s life insurance policy just got upgraded. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, tucked away in the Arctic Circle between Norway and the North Pole, has received a new intake of 50, 000 seeds from all over the world. The building houses an immense number of plant seeds to ensure Earth’s ongoing food security, and as such holds the key to human survival in a potentially   world. The incredible building is buried 425 feet inside a mountain and is designed to protect crop seeds such as beans, rice, and wheat from nuclear war or disease. For obvious reasons, the underground concrete structure is popularly known as the Doomsday Vault. The new batch of 50, 000 seeds is one of the largest single deposits made to the vault since scientists built the structure in 2008. Despite being funded by Norway, the vault is managed by international organization Crop Trust and has designated places for every nation on the planet to provide seedlings of native species. The countries that contributed to the latest addition include Benin, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Netherlands, the United States, Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and the United Kingdom. “Today’s seed deposit at Svalbard supported by The Crop Trust shows that despite political and economic differences in other arenas, collective efforts to conserve crop diversity and produce a global food supply for tomorrow continue to be strong,” said Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust. “Nearly every country has agreed on the importance of conserving crop diversity through Target 2. 5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to conserve agricultural diversity in seed collections,” she added. The vault currently holds nearly a million different varieties of seeds originating from almost every country in the world  —   including North Korea. Seed samples for some of the world’s most vital food sources like the potato, sorghum, rice, barley, chickpea, lentil, and wheat will be deposited at Svalbard in the coming days, bringing the total number of seed samples at the facility to 930, 821. Despite this large collection, the vault is far from capacity. “The Seed Vault has the capacity to store 4. 5 million varieties of crops. Each variety will contain on average of 500 seeds, so a maximum of 2. 5 billion seeds may be stored,”   says. In order to prevent contamination, seed samples are shipped to the island in large boxes, where they are scanned with   to ensure the contents are safe. To protect its assets, the vault comes equipped with five doors with coded locks, which are accessible by only a few people in the world. To further ensure security, the vault is only unlocked for deposits three or four times a year. For optimal storage, the seeds are sealed in     foil packages and are kept near zero degrees Fahrenheit. Thankfully, the location of the vault works as a failsafe for these conditions. “Permafrost and thick rock ensure that the seed samples will remain frozen even without power,” the website reads.

"LIGO Has Detected Gravitational Waves for the Second Time. About 1.4 billion years ago, the universe gave scientists a Christmas present. Two black holes spiraled toward one another, approaching closer and closer until they finally collided. Ripples in spacetime spread from the collision at the speed of light until, for about a second on December 25, 2015 (if you were in the United States), the space holding the atoms that make you up buckled and then relaxed. You didn’t notice, but the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory did. Today, the LIGO team announced its second detection of gravitational waves—the flexing of space and time caused by the black hole collision. The waves first hit the observatory in Livingston, Louisiana, and then 1.1 milliseconds later passed through the one in Hanford, Washington. ",0.0
"The ""road of death"" at the center of the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo.  It’s nicknamed the ”road of death”: a dusty   highway lined with the wreckage of   cars and the shells of blackened, deserted buildings. It’s also the only way into the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo, and the latest desperate attempt at a ceasefire collapsed in part because of a fierce fight over its future.    The highway is called Castello Road, named after a restaurant and resort complex that was shuttered earlier in the    Syrian civil war. It stretches from Turkey to   eastern Aleppo, where 250, 000 civilians are facing shortages of food, water, and medicine. The UN’s top aid official, Stephen O’Brien, recently said the grim situation there amounted to a ”humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed and carnage in the Syrian conflict.”           Under the terms of the ceasefire pact, the Syrian troops who have held the road since July and the rebels who’ve been fighting to take it back ever since were supposed to pull back from the highway, allowing aid convoys to make their way to Aleppo. Trucks holding enough supplies to feed 40, 000 people for a month have been stuck in the Turkish city of Cilvegozu, unable to reach Aleppo’s starving residents. That didn’t happen. Instead, the deal collapsed in acrimony after a dramatic few days that began with a botched US airstrike that killed 62 Syrian troops and ended with Damascus announcing that the ceasefire was over. For Washington and its allies, meanwhile, the continued closure of Castello Road meant the deal had failed even before its formal collapse because the pact hadn’t prevented Aleppo from continuing to starve while aid convoys languished just over the border in Turkey.    The culprit? The continued sparring over Castello Road. Under the terms of the pact, Syrian forces and rebel troops were both supposed to pull back from the highway so the aid trucks could start to roll in. Neither side fully kept up its end of the bargain, leaving the road too dangerous for the trucks to navigate. In the end, none of the aid convoys were able to make it down the highway and into the   areas of Aleppo.    In a statement, O’Brien, the UN human rights chief, said he was ”pained and disappointed” the aid convoys weren’t able to reach the city. Neither he nor senior American diplomats offered any guesses about when that could change.           Before the collapse of the pact, Russian troops  —   who have been in Syria fighting on behalf of the Assad government  —   had began deploying into Syrian military positions along the highway. Those can be dangerous places to be: In a widely shared video, a Russian officer standing on Castello Road began praising the ceasefire, only to have to run for cover when gunfire suddenly rang out.     During Live Russian MoD Briefing from #Aleppo Russian&Syrian soldiers on #Castello road came under fire pic. twitter.   —   Military Advisor (@miladvisor) September 13, 2016  Almost immediately after the ceasefire broke down, the Syrian and Russian militaries began an   bombardment of   areas of Aleppo that has dramatically worsened the humanitarian crisis. The US has threatened to completely walk away from talks with Russia aimed at reinstating the ceasefire if Russia does not stop its bombardment and allow in humanitarian aid. ”We’re on the verge of suspending the discussion because it’s irrational in the context of the kind of bombing taking place,” US Secretary of State John Kerry said at an event organized by The Atlantic magazine.    Russia, however, does not seem to be moved by the threat and has vowed to continue bombing, accusing the US of trying to use a proposed ceasefire to allow the ”terrorists” (what Russia and the Assad regime call the rebels) to regroup. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that Castello Road could not be used for humanitarian aid delivery to Aleppo because of the ”terrorist threat.” And so the bombardment and siege of Aleppo continues, with no hope in sight for the tens of thousands of Syrians trapped inside.

"Donald Trump decides to honor the “One China” policy.  It turns out Donald Trump may not be looking for a fight with China after all.    Just weeks after questioning a cornerstone of Washington’s diplomatic relationship with Beijing, Trump used a Thursday night phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping to say that he would honor the   “One China” policy that has kept ties between the two superpowers on an even keel since 1979. In December, Trump had raised doubts about his commitment to the agreement  —   and infuriated many in Beijing  —   by speaking by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai  . That was a big deal in diplomatic circles because no US president had spoken to a Taiwanese leader in decades due to the One China policy. The policy acknowledges Beijing’s stance that it alone represents China’s national government and that the island of Taiwan is a breakaway province that belongs to China. All of Trump’s recent predecessors had only unofficial diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and Trump’s direct conversation with Tsai broke with that practice. Trump escalated things further when, a few days later, he refused to apologize for the call or back away from his apparent belief that the One China policy wasn’t set in stone.    ”I fully understand the One China policy, but I don’t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,” Trump said.     At the time, Trump also correctly noted that the US sells billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment to Taiwan. China doesn’t like that either  —   but it’s not considered a violation of the One China policy. Beijing pushed back swiftly against Trump, indicating that scuttling One China was a   and declaring that if the policy was ever placed on the negotiating table, talks over all other issues would immediately end.     As the Washington Post notes, it’s hard to say if Trump got anything in return for what amounts to a   after his tough talk on dropping the One China policy. Rhetoric on China’s side was vague as well. “The development of China and the United States can complement each other and promote each other, and the two countries are totally capable of becoming good cooperative partners,” Xi said, according to the state news agency Xinhua. Why Beijing is so committed to the One China policy For the Chinese government, preserving One China wasn’t just about diplomacy, but also about protecting its own legitimacy against nationalists always on the lookout for signs the country is being disrespected or bullied by the US.  Recent statements from Trump’s team have only added to their concern. During his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hinted at the idea of setting up a blockade against China’s navy in the South China Sea, which some nationalists in China interpreted as an invitation to war. And reports have emerged that Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon had predicted the US would go to war with China in the South China Sea as recently as nine months ago.      Needless to say, tensions were on the rise in the run up to Trump’s call with Xi, which had been a long time coming. It was the first conversation between the two leaders since Trump took office, and the 19th world leader that the president has spoken to or met with since Inauguration Day.  The call took place one day after Trump first extended his hand to China, when National Security Adviser Michael Flynn   a letter to China’s ambassador saying the US was looking forward to building “constructive relations” with China.  The White House said Trump and Xi had a lengthy,   talk that was “extremely cordial,” and that both leaders invited each other for a visit. The readout of the call contained no substantive details except this: “President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our ‘one China’ policy. ”  There’s a very good chance that Trump realized that gambling on using the One China policy as a bargaining chip was too risky, given how adamant Beijing was that it could potentially end up causing a severing of ties between them. There’s also the fact that China is extremely large, extremely powerful, and has a huge web of economic ties with the US  —   something that explains why it’s easier to talk about reining in China than it is to do something about it. “Every US president since Nixon has come into office promising to be tough on China, and every single one of them has backed off when they realize the complexity of the situation,” David Kang, a professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, told me during an interview in January. Trump has shown a tendency to be extraordinarily antagonistic with some of the US’s closest allies, like when he gratuitously insulted the prime minister of Australia. But his first call with China showed uncommon prudence and restraint. It’s also the first call in days that wasn’t immediately followed by key details of the conversation leaking to the press. In other words, it was a double win of sorts for a new president desperately in search of a victory. ",-1.0
"Reports of Obamacare’s implosion are greatly exaggerated.  This is the web version of VoxCare, a daily newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate. Like what you’re reading? Sign up to get VoxCare in your inbox here.    Donald Trump has, in recent weeks, laid out a vision of Republicans in Congress not actually needing to repeal Obamacare. Instead, the law will simply collapse on itself.  ”The best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,” he said in late March. ”It’s exploding right now.” He doubled down on the claim the next morning on Twitter: ”ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!”    Since he made these comments in late March, new data has come out making a convincing case that Obamacare’s marketplaces aren’t exploding  —   and that, as recently as last fall, they were actually stabilizing.     Sign up for VoxCare Vox’s daily email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff           Subscribe       By signing up you agree to our terms of use.     For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page.      Kaiser Family Foundation put out new data this morning analyzing individual market performance for the past five years. Insurers did take a hit in 2014, the year Obamacare started. You can see on this chart that their earnings fell precipitously and, in 2015, insurers showed significant losses. But 2016 was the year things seemed to turn around. Insurers climbed out of the red and showed a $13. 54 per member profit.          Separate research from S&P Global finds similar results. They focused on the Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, nonprofit insurers that have come to dominate the Obamacare marketplaces.     S&P looks at something called the medical loss ratio, which is a measure of how much insurers are bringing in as premiums versus how much they are paying out as medical claims. If you have a medical loss ratio of 120 percent, it means you are spending $120 in medical bills for every $100 in premiums. But, perhaps more importantly, it means you are running a health insurance company hemorrhaging money that may soon go out of business. The Blues plans had some pretty terrible loss ratios in 2014. The plan in Arizona, for example, had a 105 percent loss ratio. Vermont was at 104. 5 percent.    But 2016 looks a lot different. The Arizona plan had a 90. 1 percent loss ratio, and Vermont is down to 95. 4 percent. The analysts at S&P say this shows ”that the ACA individual market is not in a ’death spiral. ’” The Obamacare marketplaces aren’t in collapse. But they still face challenges. The S&P report shows that there are still a handful of plans on the Obamacare marketplace that had medical loss ratios above 100 percent in 2016. This helps explain why rates went up a lot last open enrollment; it was these insurers trying to make sure that the premiums they charged could cover the medical bills. There are areas of the marketplace  —   largely those that are rural with small populations  —   that are at risk of having zero health insurers in the marketplace next year. I wrote about those places earlier this week in VoxCare.  Those places are a challenge for the law  —   especially because Obamacare does not have any   plan. But even with those weak spots, the general trend with the marketplaces is toward stability. Insurers seem to be figuring out how to set premiums in the new marketplace at a level that will cover their medical bills.  If there is any uncertainty, it is in part manufactured by the Trump administration. The White House has stayed mum on key policy decisions, and that has insurers skittish about signing on for another year of marketplace coverage. Obamacare’s marketplaces weren’t on the path to explosion when Trump took office. But the president could easily push them in that direction. Most health plans stick around Virginia marketplace Big insurers Anthem and Aetna will continue selling on the Virginia marketplace in 2018, new filings with the State Corporation Commission show. UnitedHealth, however, will leave the marketplace.    Virginia has an unusually early deadline for health plans to file their 2018 plans. Most other states don’t require insurance filings until the early summer.  While the Virginia plans have submitted notice that they will sell Obamacare coverage in 2018, they have not yet submitted their premium rates. Those aren’t due until May 3.  Chart of the Day: Medical marijuana laws decrease prescriptions filled by Medicaid patients            Researchers at the University of Georgia find that Medicaid patients use fewer prescription drugs in states with medical marijuana. They estimate that what seems to be patients substituting marijuana for prescriptions could have saved the public program $1 billion annually in 2014. Kliff’s Notes With research help from Caitlin Davis  ”Lawmakers revisiting requiring those on Medicaid to work” “In a break from past federal policy, the Health and Human Services Department under Secretary Tom Price has already notified governors it stands ready to approve state waivers for ”meritorious” programs that encourage work. Separately, an amendment to the   House GOP health care bill would allow individual states to require work or training for adults, with exceptions such as pregnant women, or parents of a disabled child. Yet a surprising number of   adults with Medicaid are already employed. Nearly 60 percent work either   or   mainly for employers that don’t offer health insurance, says the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ”  —  Ricardo   Associated Press  ”Conservatives’ Goal To Relax Mandatory Health Benefits Unlikely To Tame Premiums” “‘The insurance mandates are a primary driver of [premium] spikes,’” wrote Meadows and Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) in an   in March. But do those benefits drive increases in premiums? And would eliminating the requirement really bring premiums down? Health analysts and economists say probably not  —   at least not in the way conservatives are hoping. ‘I don’t know what they’re thinking they’re going to pull out of this pie,’ said Rebekah Bayram, a principal consulting actuary at the benefits consulting firm Milliman. ”  —  Julie Rovner, Kaiser Health News  ”A New G. O. P. Health Proposal Evokes the Old Days” “In the days before Obamacare, applying for health insurance meant filling out dozens of pages of forms and submitting medical records. It was almost impossible to compare prices. Your premium might be set higher for a large number of reasons, including if your child was overweight. This could be the future in some states under the latest Republican proposal to overhaul the health law. ”  —  Margot   The New York Times  ",-1.0
"A drug company hiked the price of a lifesaving opioid overdose antidote by 500 percent.  In 1971, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first drug that could reverse a heroin or opioid overdose. More than 40 years later, makers of this drug, called naloxone, are cashing in on the nation’s opioid painkiller and heroin epidemic and   consumers.     According to a group of researchers, the cost of one package of Evzio  —   a branded version of the lifesaving injection  —   has quickly risen from $690, when it hit the market in 2014, to $4, 500. Evzio is the first   formulation, which means anybody, not just first responders or doctors, can easily use it to save their own lives or the lives of others.  That’s not all. The researchers, who studied the rising price of naloxone for a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, found price hikes in other formulations of the drug: An injectable by Hospira has increased in price from $62. 29 in 2012 to $142. 49 today, while a nasal spray version of naloxone by Amphastar now costs $39. 60  —   a 95 percent surge since 2014.  Drug overdoses kill more people than car crashes and gun violence in America, and these overdose antidotes have never been more important. But they’re also quickly becoming more unreachable for the people whose deaths they could avert.    Drugmakers do this because they can   Kaleo, the drug company behind Evzio, says the price increases are justified because of its    and   delivery system, as Shefali Luthra at Kaiser Health News reports. But, Luthra adds, the jump in price is “way out of step with production costs. ”      In reality, Kaleo  —   like the EpiPen makers who hiked the price of their injectable by 400 percent since 2007  —   increased its cost because it can.  The US drug pricing scheme is set up in a way that makes it relatively easy for companies to charge what they want  —   unlike countries with   health systems, where governments exert much more influence over the entire health care process. In England, for example, the government has an agency that negotiates directly with pharmaceutical companies. The government sets a maximum price that it will pay for a drug, and if companies don’t agree, they simply lose out on the entire market. This puts drugmakers at a disadvantage, driving down the price of drugs.     The US doesn’t do that. Instead, America has long taken a free market approach to pharmaceuticals. Drug companies haggle separately over drug prices with a variety of private insurers across the country. Meanwhile, Medicare, the government health program for those over 65, which is also the nation’s largest buyer of drugs, is actually barred from negotiating drug prices.  That gives pharma more leverage, and it leads to the kind of price surges we’ve seen with EpiPen and now with these opioid antidotes. “The EpiPen and Evzio situations have a lot of parallels,” said NEJM study author and Yale professor Joseph Ross, “persistently raising prices for a product that makes use of a novel delivery system to provide a decades old,   drug. ”  Unlike EpiPen, though, the naloxone price increases haven’t garnered much attention or outrage, maybe because of the stigma that comes with opioid addiction. In the face of an    opioid epidemic, the outrage better come soon.  ",-1.0

The clip  —   taken by his excited dad  —   shows the   teen sitting on his childhood bed as he opens what most would consider a   email. But Zuckerberg  —   who isn’t known for wearing his heart on his sleeve  —   is almost eerily calm.

"Memo to Congress: Bickering won’t cure Zika.  BACK AT the start of this year, Republican leaders were full of promises that Congress could overcome inaction and partisan stalemate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said, “Some thought the Senate could never be cured of its dysfunction and its gridlock. . . . We believed the Senate could be restored to a place of high purpose again. ” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) declared, “We need to raise our gaze. ” Well, gentlemen, it is now September, a dangerous virus has hit U. S. shores, and all Congress has contributed so far is bickering. Definitely time to raise your gaze  —   and do something constructive.  The Zika virus, transmitted by mosquitoes and by sex, has no effective cure or vaccine. To date, some 1, 080 pregnant women in the United States and its territories, chiefly Puerto Rico, have been infected; the total number of infections is more than 18, 000. For now, most cases involve travelers who brought the virus from abroad. Usually, infection causes a minor illness, but pregnant women are vulnerable because the virus can cause severe fetal birth defects. Florida has already identified two areas of   County where mosquitoes are spreading Zika; local governments are attempting to fight mosquitoes by spraying, but it appears that Zika will not disappear soon. President Obama requested nearly $1. 9 billion in emergency funds in February but ran into partisan delays and sniping. Republicans dithered, then approved a far smaller amount, attaching provisions they knew would be objectionable to Democrats, such as effectively denying money to Planned Parenthood clinics and rescinding some funding for Obamacare. These   have nothing to do with fighting Zika but triggered vigorous objections from Democrats. When Congress returned from summer recess, a $1. 1 billion Zika bill again stalled in the Senate. Now it seems the best hope for action is a Zika measure attached to a stopgap spending bill that could be voted on before the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. The president said Monday after meeting bipartisan congressional leaders that he is optimistic there will be some action. We hope he is right, because so far Congress has done little to justify optimism on this score. In the absence of approval for emergency funding, the administration earlier reprogrammed $589 million from other sources  —   chiefly   money  —   to cope with the immediate cost of combating Zika. In recent days, the nation’s top   officials have warned that the money is running out. Moreover, this is no way to run a railroad. Vaccine development is a   project requiring difficult clinical trials, and to starve it for funds now will postpone the day when an effective vaccine will be ready. This is a political season, and after Congress goes home again in a few weeks, voters will be asked to render a verdict on its performance. So far, the record is abysmal.

"This 27-year-old has become an unlikely literary sensation. Meet one of the youngest, wealthiest and most unlikely literary sensations on the planet. She’s Anna Todd, 27, who scored a fat   publishing package and a huge Paramount movie deal for her breakout fan fiction blog, “After. ” The steamy bestseller, inspired by Harry Styles of the boy band One Direction, “After” is a gargantuan   1   online tome Todd started just two years ago which has since generated 1. 3 billion online reads and 6 million comments. “I love writing, and I am one of the people who can do it and make a living,” the newly minted millionaire told The Post last week on a visit to New York. Todd first published her work on Wattpad, the     venture   free publishing platform with a total monthly audience of 45 million. In the past 30 days alone, more than 200, 000 New Yorkers have visited Wattpad. “After” was picked up by publishing house Simon & Schuster, then became a traditional sensation as a   series. Todd has also scored with subsequent novels, including her recent book “Nothing Less,” part of a spinoff series featuring the Landon character from “After. ” Wattpad does not pay contributors for posting stories. But fame and lucrative side deals have their huge rewards. Todd has made money on these side deals with Wattpad from corporate partnerships and advertising revenue. Todd is a New York Times bestselling author, and her   books have sold 5 million copies globally. “She has sold more books than many of the top writers in the world today, and Anna’s audience is huge,” said Wattpad manager Ashleigh Gardner. A former Waffle House worker, Todd has come a long way without a college degree from her native Dayton, Ohio. Last summer, she and her husband, Jordan, an Army vet, settled in Hollywood  where she’s writing and planning her next career move. “It is kind of   to my parents. They were already happy when we had made our first move, out of Dayton to Fort Hood, Texas,” Todd said, referring to where Jordan, who served three tours in Iraq, was stationed. Todd is rare, though not alone in her success. Another blogger who hit the big time is Melissa Anelli. Through her website, The Leaky Cauldron, Anelli turned her love of the “Harry Potter” book series into a bestselling book, “Harry, a History,” about the Harry Potter phenomenon, and in 2011 founded her event company, Mischief Management. “We create fan conventions that we ourselves would want to go to, placing a high value on content and passion.

The list of targeted countries is Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen  —   all   countries. Trump’s order says that it protects American people from the threat of terrorism.     It doesn’t necessarily do that. But it does show that the new president is serious about putting the Islamophobia that was a central part of his campaign into practice. That’s because none of the perpetrators of the major US terrorist attacks carried out in the name of Islam in the past 15 years have come from the nations on that list. In fact, the country home to the biggest number of terrorists who have carried out successful attacks inside the US is the US itself. Trump picked the wrong countries Set aside the question of whether imposing blanket bans on entire countries’ populations because of the actions of a few evil individuals is justified either morally or on human rights grounds. The bigger problem is that it also isn’t likely to do much to reduce the terrorism threat.    The San Bernardino shooting that killed 14 people was carried out by an   US citizen of Pakistani descent and a lawful permanent US resident of Pakistani descent. The Orlando nightclub shooter who murdered 49 people was an   US citizen of Afghan descent. The Boston marathon bombers, who identified as ethnic Chechen, came to the US from Kyrgyzstan and grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before carrying out attacks that left three dead. The militant who killed four Marines during a shooting spree in Tennessee was a   US citizen whose parents were Palestinian and Jordanian.     Faisal Shahzad, the attempted Times Square bomber, was  . Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the infamous “underwear bomber,” was Nigerian. Richard Reid, whose 2001 attempt to blow up an airplane with explosives hidden in his shoes is the reason we still have to stand barefoot in the TSA line more than 15 years later, was born in the UK to a white English mother and a   Jamaican immigrant father. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009, was born in Virginia to Palestinian parents. And the   hijackers? Fifteen were from Saudi Arabia, two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Lebanon, and one was Egyptian. Osama bin Laden was a Saudi citizen, and his top deputies  —   including the current leader of   Ayman   were Egyptian.    Literally not a single one of those countries is on Trump’s list, and the ones that do show up repeatedly  —   especially Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt  —   aren’t on the list.  Including Iran makes even less sense. The Iranians are most definitely one of the largest state sponsors of terrorism, but they prefer to arm and train Arabs in places like Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and Yemen to do their work for them. The only terrorist attack an Iranian has tried to carry out in the US was a bizarre foiled plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador as he dined at an upscale restaurant in Washington, DC, in 2011.    There was one terror attack in Minnesota in 2016 carried out by a    Somali immigrant, in which 10 people were injured (but no one died). And a few Somali Americans have in recent years been arrested and prosecuted for attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS, but even then, they wanted to leave the US to commit terror attacks, not carry them out here.     And as my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written, the average likelihood of an American being killed in a terrorist attack in which an immigrant participated in any given year is one in 3. 6 million  —   even including the   deaths. The average American is more likely to die from their own clothing or a toddler with a gun than an immigrant terrorist. But we’re not banning guns and   from coming into the country.   Some of the countries on the list are terrorism hot spots  —   but the terrorists there aren’t the ones carrying out the attacks in the US Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya are all embroiled in bloody civil wars and overflowing with jihadists affiliated with ISIS,   and other groups. Some of those groups very much want to attack the United States.  And it’s definitely possible that ISIS could send an American who’d flown to Iraq to fight back to the US to carry out a domestic attack. The US government estimates that, as of March 2015, at least 250 Americans had either joined or attempted to join ISIS overseas. But the primary threat to Americans emanating from those places is not really from the fighters themselves who are on the ground  —   because most of them are too busy fighting in those local civil wars. The leaders are there, but as with most things in life, the leaders rarely if ever do the dirty work themselves. Rather, the threat comes primarily from their propaganda, which they use to spread their ideology and radicalize young men already living in the West. The FBI says that as of September 2016, approximately 1, 000 “potential homegrown violent extremists” were under surveillance across all 50 states.  Why? Because it’s a whole lot easier that way.  If you’re Abu Bakr   the leader of ISIS, why would you take a local Iraqi fighter who is currently defending your makeshift caliphate in Iraq and send him halfway around the world to try to sneak into the United States, acquire weapons in a country where he doesn’t even speak the language, and carry out an attack  —   all without being caught  —   when you could just pump out some propaganda and inspire an American to grab a gun and go shoot up the local mall? Indeed, the Obama administration’s extraordinary decision to kill Anwar    —   a US citizen living in Yemen who was   in the Arabian Peninsula’s top   propagandist  —   in a drone strike in 2011 shows just how seriously the US takes the threat of online terrorist propaganda. A number of terrorists who have launched attacks in the US  —   including the Boston Marathon bombers and the San Bernardino shooters  —   were inspired by Awlaki’s propaganda.      But the bottom line is that adopting extremist views and committing horrendous acts of violence in the name of some ”righteous” cause, be it religion or politics or just plain old hatred, isn’t something that only Muslims, or Arabs, or immigrants do; between 2001 and 2015, more Americans were killed by homegrown   extremists than by Islamist terrorists. Banning people from a few   nations won’t reduce the terror threat. And it definitely won’t eliminate it. ",-1.0
"Sarah Palin, the political mother of Trump.   “I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest. ”  —   Donald Trump   Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. View Archive   Facebook Google+ RSS    “You can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska. ”   —   Sarah Palin   Mark Salter, the longtime John McCain consigliere, was just asked by Politico’s Glenn Thrush whether he believed McCain’s choice of Sarah Palin as his 2008 running mate “opened the door a crack for a   candidate. ”    Remember when   Gov. Sarah Palin told the nation the difference between ”a hockey mom and a pitbull?” Or when she called for President Obama to be impeached? Here are those moments and more from Palin. (Sarah   Washington Post)   “Maybe a little,” Salter said after a pause.  Stuff and nonsense. Salter was being modest. Palin’s nomination didn’t crack the door for Trump. It birthed him. Palin is, politically, the Mother of Trump.  Some of their similarities, such as their curious ways of justifying their knowledge of Russia, are superficial. Trump, asked by NBC’s Chuck Todd where he gets his military advice, said: “Well, I watch the shows. . . . You know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows. ” This had more than an echo of Palin’s reply to Katie Couric in 2008 about which newspapers or magazines she reads: “Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me all these years. ”  But the likenesses go much deeper, between the candidates themselves and among the followers they’ve inspired: The attacks on the media. The demonization of a supposed “establishment. ” The huge and sometimes violent crowds. The prominent platforms given both candidates by Fox News. The racist responses among supporters. The paranoia about taking away guns. The suspicion of science. The scapegoating of Muslims. The portrayal of President Obama as something other than American.  Well before Trump built his national political reputation by questioning the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate, there was Palin. In December 2009, she called it a “fair question” and “fair game” and said “the public rightfully is still making it an issue. ” In 2011, after Trump said he was sending investigators to Hawaii to probe Obama’s birth, Palin responded, “More power to him. ” Before Trump said he would bring back waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse,” there was Palin. Two years ago, she talked about how “if I were in charge, they would know that waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists. ” Before there was Trump talking about banning Muslim immigration (a stance Palin supports) and forced registration of Muslims, there was Palin. “Let Allah sort it out,” was her 2013 response to the Syrian civil war.

"Passenger thrown off flight after confronting Ivanka Trump. JetBlue kicked a Brooklyn lawyer and his Hunter College professor husband off a plane at JFK on Thursday morning  —   after he accosted fellow passenger and future first daughter Ivanka Trump right before takeoff. “Your father is ruining the country!” lefty lawyer and avowed Hillary Clinton supporter Dan Goldstein shouted at Trump, as she sat with her husband, Jared Kushner, and their three kids in the main cabin,  . The plane was heading to San Francisco and the family planned to catch a connecting flight to Hawaii, where Trump has a vacation place, senior transition team sources  . Goldstein had planned to “harass” the    as soon as the couple set eyes on her at the terminal, according to his husband’s own Twitter postings. The   turbulence began with Goldstein’s professor hubby tweeting that “my husband” was “chasing” Trump down at the terminal  —   in order “to harass them. ” “Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5,” Matthew Lasner tweeted before boarding the morning flight, referring to Terminal Five. “Flying commercial,” noted the tweet, from an account which was later deleted. “My husband chasing them down to harass them,” Lasner’s tweet continued, followed by the hashtag #banalityofevil. Later, though, Lasner backed off the harassment mention. “Ivanka and Jared on our flight. My husband expressed displeasure in a calm tone, JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane,” Lasner huffed. Goldstein’s three most recent Facebook posts hyped a trio of failed     escapades: a Change. org petition to encourage the Electoral College to make Clinton president, and two others promoting recounts in North Carolina, Arizona and Florida. As a VIP, Trump and her family had been escorted onto the plane before the other passengers by a contingent of Secret Service and Port Authority cops, sources told The Post. The cops then left. Secret Service agents took seats on the plane with the Trump family, but were not involved in the incident, sources said. Once inside the cabin, Goldstein, who had a child in his arms, began shouting at Trump, demanding to know why she was on the flight and not on a private plane. He also began “jeering” at the kids, a source told TMZ. “Why is she on our flight? She should be flying private,” Goldstein reportedly shouted. One passenger on the flight told TMZ that Ivanka calmly ignored the shouts and tried distracting her three kids with crayons. Both men were escorted off the plane by JetBlue staff and offered “the next available flight,” the airline said. “You’re kicking me off for expressing my opinion?” one of the men griped as they were led out, according to TMZ. The deplaned couple apparently share a staunch   attitude. “The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly,” JetBlue said in a statement issued later Thursday. “If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight,” the airline said. “In this instance, our team worked to   the party on the next available flight. ”",1.0
"Like an ineffective parent, Paul Ryan is just enabling Trump.          Paul Ryan’s empty chastisements of Donald Trump’s failures of leadership remind me of my own periodic bouts of highly ineffectual parenting. With every morally reprehensible, politically dangerous and socially damaging attack Trump makes on decency, constitutionalism and individual people, Ryan produces yet another talk bubble of coddling enablement. Ryan is about to write himself into history as one of those who were asleep at the switch at a pivotal moment of American political decline. On Trump’s comments about how supporters of the Second Amendment should respond to Hillary Clinton, he said: “It sounds like just a joke gone bad. I hope he clears it up very quickly. You should never joke about something like that. ”  On Trump’s attacks on the parents of Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed serving in Iraq: “Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice  —   and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  —   should always be honored. Period. ”  On Trump’s attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel: “I disavow these [comments]. I regret those comments that he made. . . . Claiming a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed. It’s absolutely unacceptable. . . . The way I look at this is if you say something that’s wrong, I think the mature and responsible thing is to acknowledge it was wrong. ” But, of course, Trump didn’t acknowledge that his comments on Curiel were wrong. There have been no consequences from Ryan for crossing Ryan’s bright line on how those who have died for the country should be treated. Trump has not cleared up his comment about the Second Amendment, because few of his comments can ever really be cleared up, dependent as they are on trademark Trumpian innuendo and vagueness. Trump dwells in the realm of the suggestive to land his hits while also maintaining plausible deniability. The         is his basic working method. So now, every time I hear Ryan on another Trump misdeed, I hear my   self talking to my kids. What? You’ve hit your sister again? You know you’re not supposed to do that. Do that again and you won’t get any bedtime stories! Seriously! Another fib? Really, haven’t I told you that’s no good? No more of that, sweetie, or this time there really will be consequences! Ryan can yammer on all he wants. At this point, it’s utterly meaningless and only counts as one more voice in a chorus of Trump enablement. And what precisely is Ryan enabling? Not merely Trump but also a further and especially steep descent of American political culture into a nihilism corrosive enough to imperil the foundations of democracy and constitutional politics.  Ryan has accepted marriage to Trump’s immoral, unconstitutional commitments for the sake of the potential acquisition of power that will permit him to pursue his agenda. This is the act of the proverbial foolish man who built his house on the sand. Constitutionalism and democracy are both nothing more than crystallized, concretized, institutionalized versions of common decency and fairness. If you have been given the opportunity of political leadership but undermine the foundations of democracy and constitutionalism in the process of trying to wield their powers, you will go down in history not as a statesman but as a     sycophant. Put aside Trump’s original supporters from the birther movement, the   movement and the white nationalist movement. Over the past year, he has clearly won a great deal more support among ordinary, decent Americans. During this time, Trump has been leading his supporters to new understandings of what political leadership consists of. Those new understandings  —   with their abandonment of   moral “guardrails,” to borrow a phrase from David Frum  —   are a   danger to our country. They can be countered only by other leaders who repudiate them and seek to rebuild the standards of decency and moral seriousness on which democracy rests. Those repudiations can’t be so many empty words, blowing away with the winds, scarcely keeping up with each new infraction from the child. Only leaders who with their actions set an alternative course are likely to find themselves in the winning column in history’s review of 2016. There is only one action through which Ryan can achieve this. He needs to repudiate Trump. He needs to figure out how to lead at least his own people away from the dismal place we’ve reached. If he can’t stomach Clinton, there is always Gary Johnson.

"House Republicans inch closer to repealing Obamacare.  Suddenly, House Republicans sure seem like they are starting to move again on their previously stunted quest to repeal and replace Obamacare.    Where that movement is actually heading is not yet clear. House Republicans do seem to be inching toward a deal that could get enough votes to pass an amended version of the American Health Care Act. On Wednesday afternoon, in a major breakthrough for the bill, the House Freedom Caucus  —   a bloc of three dozen archconservatives  —   collectively endorsed it.   NEWS: Freedom Caucus announces official position of support for AHCA with MacArthur amendment included —   Alyssa Farah (@Alyssafarah) April 26, 2017    But it isn’t clear if they alone deliver enough votes for the bill to pass. That leaves the AHCA’s fate in the hands of the House’s moderate Republicans.    It comes at a particularly crazy time for Congress. Republicans are floating a new amendment to their health care reform bill the day before the White House reveals more details about its tax reform push  —   all in the same week the government needs some kind of spending agreement to avoid a shutdown. And this is ahead of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days marker on Saturday.     The breakneck pace creates the appearance that Republicans are working very hard and maybe getting close to a deal. That’s what really matters, in the end. But early reviews are much more mixed: Nobody seems sure House Republicans have actually found a compromise that can pass. The new amendment tries to solve political problems, but it might create other ones Text of a reported deal between members of the archconservative and centrist wings leaked on Tuesday night. As Vox’s Sarah Kliff outlined, it would allow states to opt out of some of Obamacare’s insurance rules, which required more comprehensive health coverage while also prohibiting insurers from charging sick people more for insurance than healthy people.    Those parts of Obamacare have been core to the Republican plan’s political problems. The archconservatives, a group called the House Freedom Caucus, wanted them gone. But moderates in the Tuesday Group wanted to keep them and feared the coverage losses that would result from rolling them back. That disagreement stopped the GOP bill in late March, but leaders from both wings have kept talking over the past month. The White House has also kept the pressure on for the House to reach a deal, after being embarrassed by the bill’s initial failure and amid the president’s desire to secure an early legislative achievement before he hits 100 days in office. Reports of a   have occurred again and again this month, but Tuesday’s movement feels the most significant. First, the Washington Post reported that the leaders of the Freedom Caucus were on board with the new compromise:      confirmed by a person close to Freedom Caucus: Meadows, Jordan, Labrador are now supportive of the changed HC bill, have told WH —   Robert Costa (@costareports) April 25, 2017    Then the actual legislative text of the compromise leaked to Politico. It was the first time that the new policy, which has been rumored for some time, was actually put into hard language. More Freedom Caucus members said positive things about the bill, per Axios. But despite this flurry of activity  —   again, just a few days before the   threshold  —   it’s not actually clear that the bill has cleared its fundamental hurdle: the 216 votes necessary to pass in the House. There is still a big gap between the Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group The Freedom Caucus has come around. But then there are the moderates. One health care lobbyist told me recently that, by their count, more moderate Republicans opposed the original bill than Freedom Caucus members. The new deal, which was negotiated on the moderate side by Congress member Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who actually already supported the GOP plan, doesn’t give them much in the way of policy wins. States can opt out of the Obamacare provisions  —   a win for the Freedom Caucus  —   but there isn’t a clear victory for the centrists. Many experts don’t believe that setting up   pools, the   protection to make sure people with preexisting conditions are covered, in a nod to moderate concerns, would be foolproof.  “For the moderates, allowing the state to decide is not quite as bad as the feds, but it’s close enough,” one health care lobbyist told me. “How can they argue they’ve protected lives when they just handed the gun to someone else?”    Not to mention: Many moderates were unnerved by the deep Medicaid cuts in the original bill, and those would remain under the compromise. The other problem: The Tuesday Group doesn’t usually operate as a bloc in the same way that the Freedom Caucus does. So just because MacArthur, who already supported the bill, is on board doesn’t mean that he’ll be joined by his colleagues. If you’re a Republican lawmaker already skittish about the bill, what about the new plan changes your assessment?  “If you promised not to mess with preexisting conditions or cause anyone to lose coverage, how does the MacArthur Amendment get you to yes?” another GOP lobbyist told me. “Plus, MacArthur brings along exactly zero members with him, because that is how the Tuesday Group rolls. ” That aligns with the early public comments from the moderate wing to the new plan.   Rep. Leonard Lance, a moderate Republican opponent of AHCA, tells me he’s still a no despite the   changes. —   Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) April 25, 2017    Other statements from House members on Tuesday night didn’t exactly inspire comments.   . @RepLouBarletta (who isn’t part of a hill GOP group) told me during  votes 2night that no ’yes’ should be taken for granted on health care. —   Lauren Fox (@FoxReports) April 26, 2017    Then it becomes a math problem for Republican leaders and the White House. They can only lose 22 votes to get to 216. By the New York Times’ count, 33 Republicans were opposed to the original version of the GOP bill, and many others were either concerned or hadn’t taken a public position.    So even as the new plan wins over the Freedom Caucus, is it actually winning enough votes? What if more moderates start to drop off because they fear attacks saying they are voting to gut protections for sick people? And even if they somehow manage to get enough votes in the House, what happens in the Senate? A lot seems to be happening on health care, very suddenly. But all it seems to be doing is raising questions.  ",-1.0
"Chemist admits botching crime lab results for nearly a decade. More than 20, 000 drug convictions in Massachusetts will be tossed out after a lab chemist admitted she intentionally botched evidence for nearly a decade. Annie Dookhan pleaded guilty to faking lab results and contaminating samples between 2003 to 2012, casting doubt on 40, 000 cases she handled at the Hinton laboratory in Jamaica Plain, Prosecutors said Tuesday they’ll throw out more than 20, 000 of those convictions in a move that could be unprecedented. “The dismissal of thousands of tainted drug lab cases rightly puts justice over results,” said Martin Healy, the Massachusetts Bar Association’s chief legal counsel. “It is a necessary and   outcome, given our criminal justice system’s responsibility to ensure a level playing field for all, regardless of the offense. ” The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is expected to hand down an order of dismissal this week and affected defendants will be notified. The American Civil Liberties Union, which fought for the dismissals, estimated about 320 cases handled by Dookhan remain. “This was a mistake that comes from the war on drugs,” Dookhan served three years in prison and was released last year.",1.0
"Whatever happened to Bobbie Gentry? In search of country musicâ€™s great vanished star..       It s the third of June. Somewhere in Mississippi, it s another sleepy, dusty delta day. Since the summer of 1967, when the Southern gothic ballad  Ode to Billie Joe, ? set on this day in that place, first hit the airwaves, the song has captivated American pop culture in a way few ever have. Written and sung by an unknown young woman from Mississippi named Bobbie Gentry, it was an eerie,   mystery about an unnamed young woman and her family sitting around a farm dinner table discussing, in elliptical terms, the suicide of Billie Joe McAllister.  It sold tens of millions of copies. It knocked the Beatles off the top of the charts. It spawned a 1976 movie. It made Gentry a hot Vegas star. She kicked around with Elvis and Tom Jones and briefly married casino magnate Bill Harrah.  The song s iconic success also helped launch one of the most enduring riddles in pop: Whatever happened to Bobbie Gentry?  She had a few minor hits after  Ode, ? appeared on early  70s entertainment shows and then went kapoof in the early 1980s. No appearances. No pictures. No interviews.  Over time, she became regarded as the J. D. Salinger of pop music. She made Harper Lee look chatty. She went full Garbo.  It s most often reported that she is living in seclusion in Los Angeles, as if she has morphed into a   Norma Desmond holed up in a creepy mansion on Sunset Boulevard. That isn t true.  And Gentry spoke to a reporter, for this story, apparently for the first time in three decades. We caution you not to get too excited about that. It s one sentence. Could be two.  Then she hung up.    An open secret All Southerners come home, even if it s in a pine box, Truman Capote once opined. That is what the   Gentry has done, hidden in plain sight, known perhaps to a few friends and neighbors, but nobody who ever blabs.   I think, to some, it s an open secret, ? says Tara Murtha, author of  Ode to Billie Joe, ? a 2015 book that s by far the most thorough biography of Gentry s public career. In it, Murtha cites reports from Savannah papers that a  Bobbie Gentry ? lived in the Georgia city in the late 1990s but had since moved. In an interview yesterday, she said she knew where Gentry now lives but had not printed it. She never spoke to Gentry but said she had sent letters through intermediaries that were never answered. The short answer to one of pop s great mysteries: Bobbie Gentry lives about a   drive from the site of the Tallahatchie Bridge that made her so famous, in a gated community, in a very nice house that cost about $1. 5 million. Her neighbors, some locals and some real estate agents know who she is, although it s not clear which of her many possible names she goes by.  We ll be a little more specific in a minute. First: How can someone once so famous vanish so completely? A complicated family history, a stage name, a couple of   marriages and a false birth date on her official PR material helped. Gentry s name at birth, in Mississippi, was Roberta Lee Streeter. But her parents divorced when she was young, and she lived with her grandparents. She moved to L. A. to be with her mom and soon adopted the  Bobbie Gentry ? stage name. She divorced Harrah, then married and divorced country singer Jim Stafford in the late 1970s.  Further, the music studio had shaved a couple of years off her actual birthday.  Gentry s family didn t talk, and she had cut off nearly all her friends in the music business. When reporters reached out through intermediaries, there was never a reply.  I think it s simpler than it seems, ? Murtha said.  She apparently didn t like the music business, went on to other businesses and never missed the spotlight. ?    Gentry in London in 1969. (AP  )  Hot on the trail Stafford and Gentry had a very small wedding in 1978, but they did allow a reporter from the Memphis Commercial Appeal to attend the ceremony on their   horse farm in Somerville, about 45Â miles east of the city.   It s wonderful to stand on your own land, where you plan to live and raise a family, ? Stafford is quoted as saying at the time.  Today, computer databases clearly show that perhaps the nation s most reclusive pop star lives in an    house with a great pool not all that far from the old homestead. Real estate agents confirmed it.  So, yesterday, I found myself looking at a phone number on my computer screen for several seconds. No reporter, to the best of my knowledge, has spoken to Gentry in decades.  I punched the numbers.  After a few rings, a pleasant woman s voice said:  Hello. ? I introduced myself and my newspaper. I said I was looking for the person whose name appears on the property owner s record. There was a dead pause of several seconds. My fingers clenched open and closed.  There s no one here by that name, ? she said, finally.  I apologized and started to read back the number, to make sure I had dialed it correctly, and she hung up. But there isn t really any doubt.  I talked, for about 13 seconds, to Bobbie Gentry.  Some mysteries can be solved. What Billie Joe and his girlfriend threw off the Tallahatchie Bridge? No. That can t.

"Why the UN wants to circumcise 25 million adult men. In an episode of “Sex and the City,” Charlotte’s   boyfriend gives the following assessment of the pain of adult circumcision: “On a scale of one to five, I’d give it a 72. ” To get a little more scientific, a 2013 article from the Journal of Urology, titled   said “Pain is mild to moderate after circumcision   …     Severe pain is rare and mostly related to complications. ” But even if severe pain is rare, what’s the point of opting to go through any kind of discomfort in one of the most sensitive regions of the body? Mainly because it could save lives and help end a global health crisis. In June this year,   that they intended to end the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030. One aspect of smashing the disease was accelerating prevention, specifically by aiming to, by the year 2020, “reach 25 million young men in high HIV incidence areas with voluntarily medical male circumcision. ”  (WHO) studies have shown male circumcision can reduce the risk of getting infected by   in heterosexual men by as much as 60 percent. Still, the prospect of blades and bleeding from that part of the anatomy makes adult circumcision a hard sell to even the most sensible of men, which is why PrePex has been such a revelation in   Africa. Requiring no injected anesthesia, surgery or stitches, PrePex is a method of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) that can be administered by a nurse in a clean  —   but not necessarily sterile  —   environment, in a matter of minutes. In broad strokes, a nurse  —   who can be trained to perform the procedure in three days  —   inserts a rigid ring inside the foreskin at the site of the circumcision, then a rubber ring is released on the exterior of the penis, over the inner ring. The rings sit in for around seven days, cutting off blood and oxygen flow to the foreskin, during which time the man can go about his daily life as per usual (although the company notes that, “discomfort while wearing the device” can occur). At the end of the week, a nurse removes the rings and the necrotic foreskin, using a pair of dull scissors. The removal of the inner ring can involve “brief pain,” although PrePex has testimonials from people who say they felt no pain at all. Manufactured by Israeli company Circ MedTech Ltd, the whole procedure costs between $15 and $20 and is being offered to adult males in a number of   nations free of charge. Associate Professor Andrew Vallely, of the Kirby Institute at University of New South Wales, told News. com. au that while, “there’s no real consensus as to the fundamental mechanism by which male circumcision works,” a workable suggestion as to why the procedure helps prevent infection in heterosexual males has been put forward. “One of the early hypotheses is that the inner foreskin is fundamentally different to the outer foreskin,” Vallely says. These differences were thought to be in the inner and outer foreskins’ epithelial structure. The difference makes it easier for   to infect a man’s body. “When the penis is erect, during sex, that inner foreskin is exposed and it exposes an area that is more susceptible to HIV infection. ” It’s also important to note that VMMC is not being held up as the key to ending   with the WHO saying it, “provides only partial protection,” and that people in   areas should participate in testing and counselling, and practice safe sex by using both male and female condoms. And while circumcision may help to prevent    contraction of the virus,   “Studies of whether circumcision of males reduces HIV transmission to their female sex partners overall indicate no protective effect. ” While the WHO has made circumcision a priority in   Africa, it’s a region with high incidence of the   disease. By comparison, experts have set Australia the ambitious yet achievable target of  . As such, Vallely says Australians don’t really need to consider circumcision for the purpose of   prevention. “But circumcision has also been associated with reduced risks of other infections, STIs, and there’s good evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of Human Papilloma Virus,” he says. “I guess it depends on your rationale, as well as religious and other sociocultural reasons as well. ”",1.0
"What Senate Republicans need to do right now.  With the House’s passage of the American Health Care Act, House Republican leaders have handed their Senate counterparts the biggest legislative weapon they have held in their entire careers. At this point, Senate Republicans should learn from a bit of wisdom often attributed to one of the wittiest and most   Founders, Ben Franklin: “We must, indeed, all hang together,” he supposedly told the Continental Congress in 1776, “or most assuredly we shall all hang separately. ” If the 52 GOP senators agree to stay together and maneuver through the next month together, they could bring about a huge breakthrough for the country and a rejection of the gridlock that has consumed the Senate for years.  The Senate GOP should begin their part of the legislative process with a sort of Republican Hippocratic Oath: “First, do no damage in your statements and press appearances. ” Stake out no   demand no specific changes, stash the posturing at the town halls. Duck all questions on specifics. Smile and say “no comment. ” Just stick to a message of “We are working together as a caucus toward a common goal of saving American health care from Obamacare and advancing other critical goals. ” Ask Senate leaders to keep you in the loop, but to avoid leaks don’t loop in anyone from your staff. Shut up and sit down, in other words  —   unnatural acts for senators, I know, but crucial right now. Save us your wisdom until after the deal is done or falls apart. Of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) Majority Whip John Cornyn (Tex.) and Republican Conference Chair John Thune (S. D.) the other 49 GOP senators should demand that they bring back from negotiations with Democrats a “majority keeper and majority builder”: a bill or a group of bills that addresses Obamacare’s many deficiencies as well as a reversal of the sequester’s limits on defense spending, a commitment on moving judicial nominees forward, and tax reform. This would both do good for the country and lay the groundwork for expanding the GOP majority in the 2018 midterms. Republicans will need both a carrot and a stick to get Democrats to the table. To keep Democrats from dragging their feet, Republicans can threaten   approval of the AHCA via the reconciliation process, which prohibits filibusters. A pledge from all 52 GOP senators to go that route if necessary is the hammer that should make the Democrats step up to the table to negotiate the numerous problems facing the country and left behind by President Barack Obama. For Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N. Y.) to sit down and deal with McConnell, though, the Democratic leader needs more than just threats. He needs some genuine wins for his base. There are several options here: tweaks to the new   regime, immigration reform that allows the “dreamers” and millions more who haven’t broken any laws since illegally entering the country to stay and work (but not to vote) and of course infrastructure spending. With the last option in particular, there is mutual interest that can mean dollars for every state (and every imperiled Democratic senator standing in 2018). Republicans can score a win by requiring that those dollars be spent by the state and local governments  —   preferably the local governments  —   and not by Washington. Loading the agreement with a good bit of spending  —   with ending the defense sequester as top priority  —   will make it all go much easier for all concerned. If the 52 Republicans can sign a letter to Schumer threatening speedy approval of the House’s bill absent serious negotiations and an   comprehensive “big deal,” then those Republican senators with qualms about the AHCA can get their fixes embedded in the final   bill, and those with needs outside of the AHCA can work through the leader to obtain them, and the bill or bills can pass with bipartisan support. What can’t work is 52 Republicans demanding 52 amendments. House Republicans realized the consequences of their earlier failure to stay united on this issue and got most of the Freedom Caucus’s most intractable members back on board to work out a deal. Now the Senate GOP needs to do the same. It has to work together, and through its leadership, or it will be back to the minority despite the very unlevel playing field of the 2018 elections. If the 52 senators stick together now, so much is possible. Don’t blow it, Republicans.   Read more:   Jennifer Rubin: Did Republicans just score a win on health care  —   or lose?

"Is the D.C. mayor losing control of her city?.  Mayor Muriel E. Bowser is struggling to stand up to an aggressively liberal D. C. Council, which in the past six weeks alone has legalized assisted suicide in the nation’s capital and guaranteed new parents two months of paid time off. A moderate Democrat whose roots are in the   African American neighborhoods of Northeast Washington, Bowser increasingly finds herself at odds with a council infused with the leftist tendencies of the District’s millennial newcomers. Heading into her third year in office, the mayor appears to be losing ground, sidelined as lawmakers advance a wish list of progressive policies without her cooperation, and sometimes despite her opposition. The outcome could determine whether the city focuses on the national priorities of the political left  —   such as   programs and business regulation  —   or Bowser’s more conventional urban agenda of schools, crime and homelessness. The latest display of the mayor’s predicament came last week, as council members gave preliminary approval to a $250    program that will tax local businesses to provide   workers with some of the nation’s most expansive   and   benefits. Citing its expense and disproportionate benefits to commuters from Virginia and Maryland, Bowser has repeatedly said she does not want to carry out the plan, which creates a new agency with a budget larger than that of the Department of Public Works. But in a sign of her waning stature at city hall, it seems she will have little choice: The bill passed the council on its first reading with the supermajority necessary to override a veto. “The dynamics are different, because the entire shape and political bent of the council have changed dramatically in just two election cycles,” said Adams Morgan neighborhood activist and former council candidate Bryan Weaver. “This really does sort of show it’s a new era. It will be tough for the mayor. ” Bowser’s defeat on paid leave could portend other struggles as she tries to counteract what some criticize as the   ways of the council’s ascendant newer members. Even in overwhelmingly Democratic big cities, mayors  —   whose duties include fighting crime and fiscal stewardship  —   sometimes act as a check on expensive or provocative impulses from legislators. But Bowser will have few immediate tactical advantages as she tries to fulfill that role. When newly elected council members are seated next month, the bloc of four allies she relied on when she took office last year will shrink to one  —   Brandon T. Todd, her chosen successor for her old Ward 4 seat. Some fear that the combination of a weakened mayor and an inexperienced,   council could mean trouble as the city seeks to preserve its   fiscal stability, with major investments in its transit system required over the next several years and questions about the future of federal funding under   Donald Trump. “With so many new people on the council, there’s a lot to learn about our unique fiscal situation,” said longtime District political activist Marie Drissel. At present, she added, the mayor “really doesn’t have the kind of support” she would need to put the brakes on fiscally reckless legislation. City hall’s political equilibrium will be further unsettled by the return of former mayor Vincent Gray, who continues to command respect and influence despite a 2010   scandal that threatened to end his career. Gray, a relatively centrist Democrat who was elected to the council in November to represent Ward 7, is a potential ally for the mayor from an ideological standpoint. But many question whether they can overcome the ill will that took root during the bruising 2014 mayoral campaign, which Gray lost to Bowser. In an interview, Gray said he hoped to “work constructively” with the mayor despite their history, particularly on issues important to his constituents in the city’s poor easternmost neighborhoods. “I would hope that she and I can find common ground,” he said. Gray will join a group of legislators whose relationships with the mayor and her staff have frayed, most recently in the conflict over family leave. Council member David Grosso (  Large) attacked the mayor in a news release Dec. 5, the eve of the vote, saying she “cannot summon the courage to take a position” on paid leave herself and was instead working to gut the bill through Council member LaRuby May (  8) one of her outgoing allies. Such barbs are not particularly sharp by the standards set in recent showdowns at the John A. Wilson Building. In May, during a debate over city homeless shelters, a livid Bowser called Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) “a        liar” during a tense exchange that found its way into news reports. “I don’t think that’s helpful,” said former council member Sekou Biddle. Especially when a politician does not command natural allegiance from colleagues, he said, it is crucial to leach the venom from personal relationships in city hall. “It’s important to have a generosity of spirit,” Biddle said. “You have to, as much as possible, assume a positive intent from other people. ” Bowser declined an interview request. Her spokesman, Kevin Harris, said the mayor had been “incredibly effective” at moving her agenda through the council. “One vote on one issue doesn’t change an extensive track record of passing legislation and budgets that have put the District in much better standing then when she took office,” Harris said. Council member Elissa Silverman (  Large) a progressive who has served on the council since last year, said the mayor had done little to find common ground with opponents in areas where there is broader agreement, such as homelessness and education. “My hope is the mayor looks to do more   with the council in the future,” Silverman said. “I think these past two years has been more of an    ‘if you’re not with me you’re against me’ approach, which has limited our ability to work together in areas where we naturally agree. ” Silverman disputed what she said was a caricature of a runaway D. C. Council squandering taxpayer money. She said the council’s priorities have been similar to those in cities with similar demographics  —   such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York  —   and largely within the bounds of Democratic Party orthodoxy. “Paid leave is in the Democratic Party platform,” she said. “We’re not being crazy leftist radicals here. ” There are many nuances to the political roles and power dynamics inside D. C. city hall. One of the District’s progressive coups this year  —   a plan to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15  —   was led by Bowser, not the council. Nor has the mayor been wholly ineffective in combating the leftward drift of city policy. Bowser has defended the District’s legalization of marijuana, enacted through a 2014 ballot measure by the same voters who put her in office. But she drew the line early this year when the council sought to allow “clubs” where pot smokers could gather. Responding to her appeals, council members dropped the idea. Even on the landmark family leave bill, the extent of victory for the progressive council members is not clear. The bill is scheduled for a final vote Dec. 20, leaving Bowser time to lobby for amendments before it passes. The council has a vested interest in securing even grudging support from the mayor, who will be responsible for the program’s implementation.  Meanwhile, the breakneck pace of the city’s progressive agenda could be slowed somewhat by Mendelson, who is advocating a   moratorium on further workplace regulations to ease the effects of the   law’s tax on businesses. Veteran D. C. activist and government watchdog Dorothy Brizill said the mayor and council could be forced to take up an   common cause if the District faces meddling from the   federal government that will assume power in about a month. The new Congress and presidential administration  —   which have final authority over the city’s budget and legislation  —   could take aim at local laws and policies over which the District’s elected officials have no disagreement, such as gun control or   funding under the Affordable Care Act. “No one knows what a Republican in the White House, in the form of Trump, is going to mean for the District of Columbia,” Brizill said. “I think the mayor and the council are going to have a number of issues on their hands. ” ",-0.5
"Donald Trump wins Georgia Republican primary.    Donald Trump has won the Georgia primary, according to Fox and NBC News. This wasn’t a surprise, as recent polls showed Trump with a   lead.    Losing Georgia is bad news for Marco Rubio Georgia should have been Marco Rubio territory. Atlanta, Savannah, and their surrounding suburbs are full of the kind of suburban professionals that have been most receptive to Rubio’s message. A recent rally in Kennesaw, a suburb of Atlanta, attracted 7, 000 people, according to Politico, compared to just 1, 200 for a nearby Ted Cruz rally. But Trump bested them both, holding a rally in Valdosta, in the South of Georgia, that drew 10, 000 supporters. The rally attracted controversy after 30 black students said they were ejected from the rally without provocation. The loss is also a disappointment for Ted Cruz. He scored his first primary victory in Iowa with the strong support of evangelical voters, who made up 62 percent of the Republican electorate in that state. Evangelicals made up 68 percent of the vote in Georgia, so Cruz might have expected to do well here.    Trump is riding a nationwide wave of popularity We won’t know the full results from Tuesday’s votes until Wednesday morning, but all signs suggest that  —   with the exception of Texas and perhaps one or two other states  —   Trump will prevail in a rout. Polls ahead of Tuesday’s vote showed Trump with   leads in at least seven of the 11 states holding primaries on Tuesday. No matter how well he does on Tuesday, Trump won’t yet have enough votes to clinch the Republican nomination.

"Chipotle is quietly paying out to E. coli victims.  has agreed to financial settlements with more than 100 customers who   lawyers for the consumers said, as it attempts to move on from a string of   problems. The burrito chain’s strategy of resolving claims out of court, which has not previously been reported, shows it wants to avoid   public battles over foodborne illnesses that battered the company’s stock price and reputation. Terms of Chipotle’s settlements with customers were confidential, lawyers representing them said this week. Chipotle has been working to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella linked to its restaurants sickened more than 500 people last year and drove away customers. On Tuesday, activist investor William Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund had purchased a 9. 9 percent stake in the company, saying it was undervalued. When asked about reported settlements, Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company “does right by our customers and simply wanted to make things right for people who were affected by any of those incidents. ” He did not disclose details of settlements. Chipotle’s use of    settlements is similar to the way burger chain Jack in the Box handled claims following a deadly E. coli outbreak in the 1990s, said Bill Marler, a lawyer for Marler Clark specializing in   cases. He represented clients sickened in both incidents. Both   companies also overhauled their   practices and hired consultant Dave Theno to help. Marler said he had one claim over foodborne illness still to resolve with Chipotle after bringing the company about 100 individual cases related to last year’s outbreaks. The claims, settled over the last six months or so, involved people whose illnesses were verified by medical tests, Marler said. Most were never filed in courts. “The way that Chipotle has been handling the legitimate claims has been ” Marler said. “They’ve taken responsibility. ” Resolving customers’ claims privately allows Chipotle to “try and move forward from a disappointing and embarrassing issue,” said Lonny Sweet, chief executive officer for The Connect Group, a marketing agency focused on food. “The last thing that they want is a battle in the courtroom over paying these people money because that keeps it in the news,” said Howard Penney, a managing director for research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, who follows Chipotle. After settling claims from some customers, Chipotle still faces a federal criminal probe into   matters and a civil lawsuit over allegations it misled investors about its   controls.",1.0

"Can You Spot the Idioms in These Photographs?. A picture is worth a thousand words, as the cliché goes, but not all words create the most precise pictures. A test your professor promises will be a “piece of cake” is great, unless you’re imagining something with buttercream. A mechanic who totes a “bag of tricks” might fix your car, but he can’t exactly perform magic. These expressions are idioms, meant to be interpreted figuratively. Photographer Gabriel Zimmer thinks it’s much more fun to do so literally. In his series Polysemantics, he takes the quirkiest English phrases at their word. “It makes you think about the way we use language,” he says. Not that Zimmer considers himself a wordsmith. Growing up in New York City, he turned to crayons and eventually cameras precisely because he isn’t one (nevermind that his work has appeared in The New Yorker). Art, he says, “fills in the gaps where language fails me.” He started Polysemantics in 2016, leaving no stone unturned in his hunt for peculiar idioms, phrases, and words. Turns out, they’re a dime a dozen, with an estimated 25,000 idioms alone in the English language. Many have origins in actual events or legends: History, for instance, is peppered with military leaders drawing actual “lines in the sand” for their bravest men to cross. But as vivid as they are, Zimmer learned not all idioms make for great photos. He tried “splitting hairs” with an ax and his own tresses, but the effect was more horrifying than humorous. A brain he sculpted from ground beef and stuck in his freezer (“brain freeze”) came out “looking, literally, like shit.” He photographed the best in his Brooklyn studio against jewel-toned seamlesses, illuminating them with two or three speedlights, each capped with a thin sheet of colored plastic for a dramatic gradating effect. The results are fun and pithy, sort of like emojis, and they highlight how people are always talking with images. Words and pictures don’t compete so much as keep each other company—like peas in a pod.",0.0
"Homelessness in the Living Rooms of the Rich. When photographer Jana Sophia Nolle moved to San Francisco three years ago, she met a lot of people. Some inhabited multimillion-dollar houses with pristine Victorian architecture and fancy furniture. Others lived in cardboard boxes. The contrast between their dwellings plagued Nolle, who hails from Kassel, Germany, where income inequality is less stark. While San Francisco boasts the highest density of billionaires per capita in the world, the Bay Area hosts the country's third-largest population of people experiencing homelessness. The government shelters only a third of them. “I’d never seen so many people living on the street in a country as rich as America,” Nolle says. “I was shocked.” So, when an unhoused man she knew suggested, jokingly, that she invite him into one of her wealthy friends’ homes, it sparked an idea: What if, instead, she pitched his tent there? This provocative vision inspired her series Living Room, sending Nolle on a quest to photograph the scrappy DIY shelters of the poor inside the immaculately styled parlors of the rich. “They’re implants in rooms where they don’t belong,” she says. The patchworks made of boxes and newspapers are reproductions of shelters she saw riding her bike through neighborhoods like South of Market, Potrero Hill, and the Mission. Many included a plywood base with wheels attached so that they could be rolled away from city workers, who like to dismantle them. Nolle spent hours chatting with the owners, who’d lived on the streets anywhere from a few months to 20 years, after getting out of prison or losing jobs or falling ill. Some even drew reference sketches of their structures and told her where she could find similar materials. She purchased ropes and tarps at hardware stores, asked places like U-Haul if they had extra boxes, and borrowed shopping carts from unhoused people who had one to spare. Nolle even traded new items for the originals when she couldn’t find something, like one woman’s Justin Bieber blanket. Nolle then erected the shelters in 15 living rooms across San Francisco neighborhoods like Haight-Ashbury, Cole Valley, and the Presidio. She met some homeowners through her then-boyfriend’s family, who recommended their own friends. One, a board member of a local foundation, invited her to symphonies, fundraisers, and other philanthropic events to meet potential participants. After explaining the project over coffee or tea, some declined, citing worries about privacy or bed bugs. Others insisted they weren’t rich. “They would say, ‘I’m more upper-middle class,’ though from my perspective I would definitely put them in the upper class,” Nolle says. The homeowners watched as she moved furniture, carried in materials, and photographed them on Kodak Portra 400 film. For Nolle, the crux of the project was to stimulate rich conversations about wealth and inequality. One family even involved their kids. The parents said, ‘We don’t think our children are really aware of how privileged they are, and this would be a great way to have a real conversation about it.”",0.0
"Cabin's Bump-Canceling Bunk Beds Promise Supersmooth Bus Rides. If you are, say, over the age of 3, chances are someone has told you not to climb into a van, parked in an alley, with a bunch of strangers. But this was for science, mom, and the very nice trio that beckoned a reporter within turned out to be rather entrepreneurial spirits, who just want to create a good night’s sleep. A good night’s sleep in any context, really, but especially for the 23 passengers they hope to pack into a bus rollicking down a California freeway. Inside, Cabin CEO Gaetano Crupi grabbed the wheel, CTO Tom Currier grabbed a jumper seat, and PR rep Ashley Thompson folded herself into what, truthfully, looked not unlike a coffin. But this long, thin box—an open box, to be fair, and one complete with a mattress, a water bottle, a sleep mask, a fleece blanket, and a whole mess of springs and wires on its underside—is what Crupi calls the key to hacking the long-haul bus market. It was time to hit the potholed highways of San Francisco. A graph of WIRED's 6-minute demo ride shows that Cabin's tech reduced the peak force/acceleration felt over the really harsh bumps of San Francisco by 88 percent. (The red line represents the passenger and the bed, and the blue line is the vehicle, in this case a van, but in the future a bus.) Cabin used off-the-shelf components, like a cheap Raspberry Pi computer and the electric motor from a hoverboard scooter, to move the bed up and down quickly enough to cancel out the lumps and thumps in the road.

"Gerrymandering is the biggest obstacle to genuine democracy in the United States. So why is no one protesting?.      Brian Klaas is a Fellow in Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics and author of The Despot’s Accomplice: How the West is Aiding & Abetting the Decline of Democracy. There is an enormous paradox at the heart of American democracy. Congress is deeply and stubbornly unpopular. On average, between 10 and 15 percent of Americans approve of Congress  —   on a par with public support for traffic jams and cockroaches. And yet, in the 2016 election, only eight incumbents  —   eight out of a body of 435 representatives  —   were defeated at the polls. If there is one silver bullet that could fix American democracy, it’s getting rid of gerrymandering  —   the now commonplace practice of drawing electoral districts in a distorted way for partisan gain. It’s also one of a dwindling number of issues that principled citizens  —   Democrat and Republican  —   should be able to agree on. Indeed, polls confirm that an overwhelming majority of Americans of all stripes oppose gerrymandering. In the 2016 elections for the House of Representatives, the average electoral margin of victory was 37. 1 percent. That’s a figure you’d expect from North Korea, Russia or Zimbabwe  —   not the United States. But the shocking reality is that the typical race ended with a Democrat or a Republican winning nearly 70 percent of the vote, while their challenger won just 30 percent. Last year, only 17 seats out of 435 races were decided by a margin of 5 percent or less. Just 33 seats in total were decided by a margin of 10 percent or less. In other words, more than 9 out of 10 House races were landslides where the campaign was a foregone conclusion before ballots were even cast. In 2016, there were no truly competitive Congressional races in 42 of the 50 states. That is not healthy for a system of government that, at its core, is defined by political competition. Gerrymandering, in a word, is why American democracy is broken. The word “gerrymander” comes from an 1812 political cartoon drawn to parody Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry’s   senate districts. The cartoon depicts one of the bizarrely shaped districts in the contorted form of a   salamander. Since 1812, gerrymandering has been increasingly used as a tool to divide and distort the electorate. More often than not, state legislatures are tasked with drawing district maps, allowing the electoral foxes to draw and defend their henhouse districts.      The process of   district lines to give an advantage to one party over another is called ”gerrymandering”. Here’s how it works. (Daron   Washington Post)   While no party is innocent when it comes to gerrymandering, a Washington Post analysis in 2014 found that eight of the ten most gerrymandered districts in the United States were drawn by Republicans. As a result, districts from the Illinois 4th to the North Carolina 12th often look like spilled inkblots rather than coherent voting blocs. They are anything but accidental. The Illinois 4th, for example, is nicknamed “the Latin Earmuffs,” because it connects two predominantly Latino areas by a thin line that is effectively just one road. In so doing, it packs Democrats into a contorted district, ensuring that those voters cast ballots in a safely Democratic preserve. The net result is a weakening of the power of Latino votes and more Republican districts than the electoral math should reasonably yield. Because Democrats are packed together as tightly as possible in one district, Republicans have a chance to win surrounding districts even though they are vastly outnumbered geographically. These uncompetitive districts have a seriously corrosive effect on the integrity of democracy. If you’re elected to represent a district that is 80 percent Republican or 80 percent Democratic, there is absolutely no incentive to compromise. Ever. In fact, there is a strong disincentive to collaboration, because working across the aisle almost certainly means the risk of a primary challenge from the far right or far left of the party. For the overwhelming majority of Congressional representatives, there is no real risk to losing a general election  —   but there is a very real threat of losing a fiercely contested primary election. Over time, this causes sane people to pursue insane pandering and extreme positions. It is a key, but often overlooked, source of contemporary gridlock and endless bickering. Moreover, gerrymandering also disempowers and distorts citizen votes  —   which leads to decreased turnout and a sense of powerlessness. In 2010, droves of tea party activists eager to have their voices heard quickly realized that their own representative was either a solidly liberal Democrat in an overwhelmingly blue district or a solidly conservative Republican in an overwhelmingly red district. Those representatives would not listen because the electoral map meant that they didn’t need to. Those who now oppose President Trump are quickly learning the same lesson about the electoral calculations made by their representatives as they make calls or write letters to congressional representatives who seem about as likely to be swayed as granite. This helps to explain why 2014 turnout sagged to just 36. 4 percent, the lowest turnout rate since World War II. Why bother showing up when the result already seems preordained? There are two pieces of good news. First, several court rulings in state and federal courts have dealt a blow to gerrymandered districts. Several court rulings objected to districts that clearly were drawn along racial lines. Perhaps the most important is a Wisconsin case (Whitford v. Gill) that ruled that districts could not be drawn for deliberate partisan gain. The Supreme Court will rule on partisan gerrymandering in 2017, and it’s a case that could transform  —   and reinvigorate  —   American democracy at a time when a positive shock is sorely needed. (This may hold true even if Neil Gorsuch is confirmed to the Supreme Court, as Justices Kennedy and Roberts could side with the liberal minority).      White House adviser Stephen Miller appeared on the Sunday morning television circuit on Feb. 12, saying, ”the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned,” on CBS’s Face the Nation. (Reuters)   Second, fixing gerrymandering is getting easier. Given the right parameters, computer models can fairly apportion citizens into districts that are diverse, competitive and geographically sensible  —   ensuring that minorities are not used as pawns in a national political game. These efforts can be bolstered by stripping district drawing powers from partisan legislators and putting them into the hands of   commissions that are comprised by an equal number of   and   voters. Partisan politics is to be exercised within the districts, not during their formation. But gerrymandering intensifies every decade regardless, because it’s not a politically “sexy” issue. When’s the last time you saw a march against skewed districting? Even if the marches do come someday, the last stubborn barrier to getting reform right is human nature. Many people prefer to be surrounded by   citizens, rather than feeling like a lonely red oasis in a sea of blue or vice versa. Rooting out gerrymandering won’t make San Francisco or rural Texas districts more competitive no matter the computer model used. And, as the   divide in American politics intensifies, competitive districts will be harder and harder to draw. The more we cluster, the less we find common ground and compromise. Ultimately, though, we must remember that what truly differentiates democracy from despotism is political competition. The longer we allow our districts to be hijacked by partisans, blue or red, the further we gravitate away from the founding ideals of our republic and the closer we inch toward the death of American democracy.",-0.5

The final episode will air Nov. 9. “We loved making that show, but unfortunately it never resonated with audiences like we hoped. And that’s on me,” Simmons said in a release. The Oct. 26 episode of the   program  —   featuring   from the worlds of sports and entertainment  —     with just 82, 000 viewers in its initial run. It had peaked with a mere 362, 000 viewers for the second episode June 29.

"Biden pledges to be available to Pence ’24-7′.      Vice President Biden and his wife, Jill, hosted Vice   Mike Pence and his family for lunch at the Naval Observatory on Wednesday, a gathering that culminated in Biden pledging to be “available to him  ” after leaving office. The   which included Pence’s wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, featured a tour of the house and grounds that the Pences will occupy starting Jan. 20. Afterward, Pence told reporters he had received a “Cook’s tour” of the residence and appreciated the Bidens’ hospitality. Biden, for his part, said he was not worried that Pence and   Donald Trump would dismantle the legacy he and President Obama had forged over the course of eight years. “No, I’m not worried about it,” the vice president said. “Look: They ran on a platform they’re gonna try to move. I think there’s a lot of things that were done where [people] can reach some accommodation.   …     It’s a whole new world. ” In the wake of Trump’s victory, Obama has privately and publicly lobbied the New York businessman to consider backing off some of his campaign pledges to undo the administration’s landmark policies. Biden, who said he and Pence discussed foreign policy matters during their time together, has now adopted the same stance. “I also said although I had been a senator for 36 years, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for a decade, in the end I had been [on the] national security apparatus for a long time, there’s a lot in town here that I’m aware of,” he said. “So I plan on being available to Mike as senior staff for him as he moves,” Biden added. “He’d be smart to reject most of my ideas, but I think he’ll listen. ”",-0.5
"A Robot Does the Impossible: Assembling an Ikea Chair Without Having a Meltdown. And just like that, humanity draws one step closer to the singularity, the moment when the machines grow so advanced that humans become obsolete: A robot has learned to autonomously assemble an Ikea chair without throwing anything or cursing the family dog. Researchers report today in Science Robotics that they’ve used entirely off-the-shelf parts—two industrial robot arms with force sensors and a 3-D camera—to piece together one of those Stefan Ikea chairs we all had in college before it collapsed after two months of use. From planning to execution, it only took 20 minutes, compared to the human average of a lifetime of misery. It may all seem trivial, but this is in fact a big deal for robots, which struggle mightily to manipulate objects in a world built for human hands. Over at UC Berkeley, engineers have taught Brett the robot to teach itself to master a children's game by failing over and over. As far as imitation learning is concerned, a startup called Kindred is helping picker robots learn to manipulate products in fulfillment centers.

"Trevor Noah: a very serious conversation with a very funny man.  Trevor Noah, the host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, is funny. Very funny. Professionally funny.    But what surprised me when I sat down with Noah for a recent episode of my podcast is just how serious he is too. In a conversation that ranged from what America could learn from South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission to why the Obama era has worsened racial polarization to how tragedy gets absorbed into partisanship, Noah didn’t crack many jokes. He didn’t destroy or eviscerate anyone. But he made a lot of good points  —   points, in many cases, that I’m still thinking about, weeks after our discussion. You can listen to our full discussion by streaming it here or by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes. What follows here are edited excerpts from a very serious conversation with a very funny man. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. For the full conversation, subscribe to my podcast!    What Obama’s presidency didn’t change about race in America         Ezra Klein: You had a great line that I’ve been thinking about since I read it a number of months ago where you said, ”If you’re black in the United States, even after two terms of President Obama, you still feel black.”  Do you feel like, watching the Obama presidency go forward, it has also shined light on what hasn’t changed?  Trevor Noah: Yeah. It came with the illusion that everything would change. It came with the illusion that everything would become different.    Ironically, what happens with every single black person is that black people are black people until they achieve a certain level of excellence, and then they become their name. I’ll give you an example  —   Will Smith. Is Will Smith black, or is he Will Smith? He’s Will Smith. Tiger Woods was Tiger Woods  —   yeah, black golfer, but he was Tiger Woods.    I find it strange that the bad apples in the black community will be used to tarnish the black community as a whole, but then the stellar performers will be somehow given a name that is outside of race. They will be given a position that is somehow precluded from race. So it’s almost like Barack Obama, yes, that man has become the first black president. But in terms of black people, in terms of the country as a whole, people felt like that would extend everywhere. I know this because the anticipation and the excitement spread into Africa. EK: So if you get arrested, you’re the example that proves the rule, but if you get out, you’re the exception that proves the rule. TN: Exactly. That’s what often happens. That’s why they always say in black families everywhere that you have to be twice as good. Because you genuinely do. You have to be good for yourself, and you have to be good for the community as well, because if you fail, the community fails.    It becomes, ”Ah, you see! Black man can’t get a job,” ”Black man can’t get his shit together,” ”Black man can’t look after his kids,” you know? But then if you do well, it’s like, ”Oh, wow, look at that. A black man who does look after his kids,” as opposed to, ”Oh, black men do well.” EK: How exhausting is it to have these expectations and fears in your head all the time? TN: Black people are always living race. When you are driving or walking down the street and you hear a police siren, I do not know a black person who does not have a feeling, just for a moment, of, ”This could change my entire day.” I’ll be driving in my car, a police siren goes off behind me, and in that instant, I go, ”I don’t know what’s going to happen.” Then it drives past me and I’m like, ”Oh, okay.” And everything is fine, I have my driver’s license, I have no problems, I have a car that’s licensed  —   but that sound could signal a change forever in my life. That is being black. You live with it at all times. You know that at any moment, it can happen to you by mistake. And that’s a scary place to live in. EK: This seems like a reality we have trouble getting at in journalism. We can cover the big things, like the Fergusons, but we don’t really have a way to talk about that moment of fear when the sirens turn on. TN: Imagine if you come from a world where you have no interactions with the police other than good interactions. You only know the police to be protecting and serving. You even know the police maybe by name. You live in a community where these are never issues for you. For somebody to come and tell you that a policeman would go out of his way to harm another person, I do not blame someone for thinking that is a complete lie. Why would the police ever do something like that? It makes no sense. But as a black person, you feel crazy when people are like, ”You just can tell the officer they don’t have the right to do that.” You say, you know, ”I wish I had your guts. I can’t believe you can just say that.” And they’re like, ”Yeah, you say, ’I need to see a warrant. You have no right! ’”    It’s like, man, we don’t live in the same world. We genuinely don’t. Should America have a South Africa —  style Truth and Reconciliation Commission? EK: I saw you’re writing a book. TN: I am. It’s just me writing a few stories  —   and how they pertain to the world today, growing up in apartheid South Africa with my mom, and living in a   society that was forged through racism. EK: What do you mean when you say a ”  society”? TN: That’s what South Africa aspired to. It’s sort of the same thing America aspired to, South Africa, to a certain extent, has done that. It’s moving to a place where most of your issues are not pinned back to race. Right now in America, a lot of the issues really do center around race. Over time, I think, in South Africa that became less and less [the case]. They were still dealing with the effects of that government, but it’s becoming less and less so. Now it’s more about income and inequality. EK: It’s interesting the way you say over time there, because apartheid in South Africa  is both more extreme and ends much later than Jim Crow.  So it doesn’t seem intuitive that you would have a quicker path to a society where these issues do not pin back to race. TN: I think we are moving faster, yeah. One of the factors is that we had a Truth and Reconciliation Commission  —   we sat down, as a country, to come to grips with everything that had been done during the most oppressive time in our history. It was the oppressors and the oppressed sitting in a room together, with the whole country watching, and talking through everything that had happened. And it wasn’t about punishing the people; it was about exactly what the name suggests  —   truth and reconciliation.    It left us in a place where no one could deny what had happened. I see that in America where people ask questions like, ”Oh, was slavery that bad?” ”Does slavery really have effects?” and ”What is the worst thing that happened?” There’s some people who don’t even believe half the stories of lynchings or police brutality. It’s still an issue of, ”Well, I don’t know if that’s all true.” I think the Truth and Reconciliation Commission really helped us do that, so we’ve progressed. It’s a different country, in that black people are the majority so the minority was oppressing the majority, as opposed to America’s history. EK: I’m gonna expose the vast acreage of my ignorance here and say that I don’t know that much about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. So when you say that everybody was watching, what were they watching? Were you watching this on television as a kid? TN: It was more than news. It was primetime television. Imagine if Americans sat down and said, ”We are going to have a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.” You would sit down with all of those who had instigated slavery or who had implemented Jim Crow  —   all of the people who ran police departments where they specifically set out to abuse minority groups. You sit down with those people  —   even white extremist organizations like the KKK  —   and you sat with them and you said, ”Listen, whatever you say now will be not held against you. If you tell the complete truth, it will in essence be forgiven, but the truth will be out there. Everyone out there will know what has happened, and you will talk through it. People will talk about how they set up housing so that black people couldn’t live in good areas. They set it up so that loans couldn’t be given to people of color; they set it up so that police departments would specifically target people of color for infractions that didn’t exist.” And that’s what you’d have to do as a country, and everyone would be watching that  —   and because it is the perpetrators who are confessing, and there’s really no reason to lie. The truth is essentially what sets you free, and that’s what we had to do.    EK: Is there a story that you remember striking you with force?  TN: There was one member of the police force who told us the story of how he would train his dogs on actual black people who had been arrested. And so he would get the dogs to basically eat the black people in front of him. He would set them loose in a field, and the black people had to run. And the dogs had to chase them down, like Ramsay Bolton in Game of Thrones. The way he talked about this, and the way they couldn’t defend themselves  —   and the way the person would try to fight the dog and he would beat them or he would shoot them. Over and over and over again. And that’s how they trained their dogs. I remember that story stuck with me because the imagery was something I could almost see. I feel like I saw the actual event taking place. How The Daily Show tries to turn tragedy into comedy            EK: Something that I’m feeling acutely lately is the gruesomeness of the news cycle. This is a very depressing election, and of course we recently had a maniac drive a truck through dozens of people in France.  Covering this stuff even in a fairly straightforward way takes an emotional toll. What does it take to go out and be funny about it? TN: You know, what I’ve come to realize in almost a year of doing The Daily Show now is that it’s not about what you find funny in the situation. I use comedy now as a pressure release valve. So I dive in; I explore what is happening, I respond to the true emotion of it, and then I use comedy as my release valve, because that’s all I can do. Sometimes I use comedy as a catharsis that just helps me get through the anger, the pain, the dismay, the disappointment that I have in what’s happening. But it’s less and less about finding the funny.    One of the things that broke my heart the most after this truck incident was the fact that it feels like every time these attacks happen, it feels like these people [the Islamic State] are winning  —   not because they’re winning in terms of a body count or in terms of a war, but because they are successfully making us turn on each other. An attack happens, and within 15 minutes, maybe even 10, people online are fighting with each other? It’s like, ”Really, guys?” Is this the time? Is this really what’s gonna move us forward? It’s now as though we are waiting for these attacks to help us prove a point  —   as opposed to working together to find a way to preserve human life. It’s just a tool that we use to be right or wrong in an argument. EK: I’d love to hear about this in a very operational way. Walk me through a joke that you’re particularly proud of having appeared on air and how it went from you seeing a news story to you expressing something that felt true and made people laugh.  TN: One was when we were talking about the shootings that were happening  —   Alton Sterling and Philando Castile  —   and it was around the notion that these cops’ body cameras at the moment of the altercation both became dislodged. ”Oh, they both became dislodged in the scuffle.” I had said during the morning meeting, ”I call bullshit on that, because I’ve seen white people cameras and they never come off.” And then we just played a trailer of those GoPro ads, where people are falling down mountainsides and snowboarding and crashing through waves and mountain biking, and in every video they come out on the other side and the camera is perfectly intact and people are cheering and screaming. And that was one of those moments where you get to inject comedy in the right way, aiming at the specific thing you’re trying to comment on, while at the same time not taking away the gravity of your argument. EK: It’s become very clichéd to say that The Daily Show and places like it are the only outlets able to tell the truth about what’s going on. Without backing that sentiment, I feel like there’s this very interesting exception to the structure of opinionated versus objective journalism that has emerged within comedy. You can say things that are clearly quite pointed, but they evade a normal set of defenses, so you can say things that don’t really have a place elsewhere in the media but often need to be said.  It always felt to me that that has to be a somewhat tricky thing to balance  —   the balance between what is the best joke or what is the funniest joke tonight, and what do I want to say that feels important with that platform? Is that a tension you feel? TN: I’ve come to the realization that the most important thing for my show is for me to tell the truth. That’s honestly it. For me to tell the truth. It’s the same thing you’re trying to do at Vox. It’s what you’re saying to your writers.    If you cannot be critical to yourself or to the side you say you support, then how can you expect the people you are arguing against to do the same? That is a big problem that I notice, especially in American politics  —   both sides gloss over their problems and then quickly pivot and turn to the other side. Ask Paul Ryan if he supports Donald Trump and what he’s saying, and Paul Ryan will within a few sentences pivot and say, ”I think the bigger question we have to ask ourselves is, ‘Will Hillary stick to conservative values and will Hillary represent conservative voters? ’” And it’s like, we didn’t ask you that. We said, ”Do you think Donald Trump will be a good president? Do you think Donald Trump represents your views?” And both sides do it. Both sides do the exact same thing. People aren’t critical of their own sides. You saw it with the Bernie Sanders movement. If you dared question the numbers of Bernie’s campaign, if you dared question his policies on trade, you would enter into a war where you would dread the day you ever mentioned his name. And yet you were going, ”But I thought we were all working in the same space. I like Bernie Sanders. But doesn’t that mean I should hold him to a high standard?” It’s the same thing essentially that goes for the police. If you are   wouldn’t you want to hold them to a higher standard? Wouldn’t you want them to be beyond reproach or as close to that place as possible? Because you are a fan of what they do, you respect the position of what they hold  —   why wouldn’t you want that? The best advice Trevor Noah got was from Dave Chappelle         EK: What’s the best advice you’ve received? TN: The best piece of advice was probably from Dave Chappelle. It was before I started the show, and he said to me, ”Whatever you do, don’t let them steal your joy.” And that I have applied not just to my show but to life. Don’t let people steal your joy. Don’t let people convince you that you are not happy. Don’t let them try and bring you into a world where you are miserable with them.    EK: How are you able to do that? TN: Just by remembering. Going home, talking to friends, realizing that a lot of the time these are champagne problems. If I have a problem with a TV show in the United States of America, that’s a champagne problem to have. Twenty years ago my problem was the fact that I didn’t have a flushing toilet. That was a problem.   years ago my problem was the fact that I couldn’t be seen in the streets with my mom or my dad, because one of them would be arrested and I would be taken away to an orphanage. That was a problem. So for me, it’s reminding myself of the level or the degree of problem. I go, ”Oh, man, these are not things for which I will allow someone to steal my joy.” Someone tweeted me something horrible, it’s like, yeah, whatever. I would worry more if the real people in your world were saying horrible things and Twitter was saying nice things. Then you should worry. But in my world, real people are good people and Twitter people can be whatever they want. ",-1.0
"Judicial originalism as myth.  “It is simply   to conceal something as fundamental as the nature of constitutional    —   especially if concealment is motivated by the fear that the citizenry wouldn’t stand for the practice if it knew the truth. If the Court can’t admit what it is doing, then it shouldn’t do it. ”  —  Paul Brest, 1981    The doctrine of originalism, whereby judges purport to identify and then rely on the original meaning of the United States Constitution to resolve constitutional cases, is more ingrained in our national consciousness today than at any other time in our history. Six years ago, one of our most liberal justices, Elena Kagan, stated during her confirmation hearing that “we are all originalists. ” Prominent professors are proudly proclaiming in our most elite law reviews that “Originalism is our Law. ”  President Donald Trump promised to nominate an originalist justice to the Supreme Court, and then followed through on that promise with Judge Neil Gorsuch, who   as an originalist. At his confirmation hearing, the term “originalism” will no doubt be uttered by every GOP senator trying to win points with his constituency and establish the nominee’s bona fides as the heir apparent to the late Justice Scalia. This genuflection toward the original meaning of the Constitution is, however, at best misleading and at worst a sham. What the words of the document meant to the people living at the time is just one of many different factors judges use to decide constitutional cases.   original meaning almost never drives the results in litigated cases but instead is used by judges to justify results they reached on other grounds. As Judge Richard Posner has written, “there has never been a time when the courts of the United States behaved consistently in accordance with the ideal” described by originalists.    There are strong reasons why judges have never consistently used originalism to decide hard cases. For one thing, if the original meaning of the framers of either the original Constitution or the Reconstruction amendments were taken seriously by today’s judges, we would live in a much different and much worse society. Segregated schools under the law and official governmental discrimination against women, gays, and lesbians would be permissible.     Originalists’ embarrassing attempts to make Brown v. Board of Education fit their theory For example, Brown v. Board of Education, one of the most important cases of the 20th century, would have turned out the other way if the justices had accepted originalist principles. The lawmakers and people who ratified the 14th Amendment, the   War amendment that granted equal protection under the law to black citizens, did not universally embrace segregation, but they indisputably understood it to be constitutionally permitted.  Criticism of Brown today would make any federal court nominee toxic and unconfirmable, so originalists have had to come up with remarkably contorted arguments to escape this obvious conclusion. Some, like Stanford’s Michael McConnell, have made unpersuasive arguments that the people living in 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, and shortly thereafter, would have thought segregated schools to be illegal. (McConnell, strangely, places special emphasis on the debates leading up to the Civil Rights Act of 1875, highlighting   arguments  —   and downplaying the widespread segregation of schools in 1868.)     Judge Robert Bork, a hero to originalists, made several arguments about Brown. In a 1971 law review article, he argued that the 14th Amendment “was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against government discrimination. ” In short, he created an abstract ideal, opening the door to arguing that what “equal” meant in 1868 is different from what it meant in 1954 (and today). But of course, once that move is made for “equal,” why not for “due process,” “establishment,” “cruel and unusual,” and other vague constitutional language that Bork thought liberal judges and scholars abused? A true originalist (or textualist) might also have to conclude that the entire Bill of Rights, including its protections for free speech, freedom of religion, and criminal procedure would be inapplicable to the states.  After all, the First Amendment only limits the power of “Congress. ” The great Chief Justice John Marshall held that none of the Bill of Rights limited state power. Whether or not the 14th Amendment changed that analysis as an historical matter is hotly contested. While over time the justices have concluded that most of the protections in the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, others think that result is not justified by either the text or history of that provision. As Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California Irvine, has pointed out, a serious    approach (as opposed to a lip service one) would mean the end of judicial protection “for liberties such as the right to marry, the right to procreate, the right to custody of one’s children, the right to keep the family together, the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children, the right to purchase and use contraceptives, the right to abortion, the right to refuse medical care, [and] the right to engage in private consensual homosexual activity. No longer would women be protected from discrimination under equal protection. ”                  Of course, no constitutional theory should be judged by outcomes alone. But most of the rights mentioned by Chemerinsky are utterly uncontroversial today. Although some forms of modern originalism might not be inconsistent with all of these rights, and some originalists might say that stare decisis concerns  —   that is, the imperative to follow precedent  —   would lead them to approve some of them, it is still startling how many basic rights we take for granted would be endangered if a majority of the court employed originalism in good faith. As early as 1939, a law scholar identified the flaws in originalist thinking The belief that originalism does not and should not drive judicial decisions is not new. In 1939, Professor Jacobus tenBroek of the University of California at Berkeley demonstrated that what he called “original intent” (but today we call original meaning) constituted “one of the fundamental fallacies of the Supreme Court of the United States. ”  The arguments he made in support of this conclusion, made in a remarkable   series in the California Law Review, are all but unanswerable as a description of how the Court decides constitutional cases. His work is as important today as it was then; all the reasons he gave for rejecting originalism as both a descriptive and normative theory apply with equal force to the modern Court. Long before the debate between the originalists and   living constitutionalists of the 1980s, tenBroek’s series showed with surprising clarity how misleading it is for judges and academics to suggest that original meaning either does or should play a significant role in constitutional interpretation. In the first four parts of his series, tenBroek showed  —   through a detailed historical analysis of judicial decisions  —   that the Justices sometimes used historical sources to support their legal conclusions but often did not. In important   cases ranging from the validity of a national bank to the constitutionality of congressional efforts to limit slavery to the permissibility of Congress printing paper money, the justices selectively used historical sources including the Federalist Papers, the actions of early Congresses, and the opinions of the Founding Fathers. It was hard to conclude, tenBroek summarized, that the judges weren’t simply selecting evidence in order to justify the results they preferred. A modern example of this selective originalist interpretation by judges is the landmark Second Amendment case District of Columbia v. Heller, of 2008, in which Justices Scalia and Stevens canvassed what each thought to be the relevant historical sources only to come to completely different conclusions as to whether the amendment protects an individual right to own guns. Serious historians have not treated either opinion kindly, and of course both men, like the justices discussed by tenBroek, reached the conclusions that you’d expect given their values writ large. In the series’ fifth and most important article, tenBroek added to his detailed historical analysis two normative assumptions that he said the justices claimed to adhere to when resolving constitutional questions: 1) judges should “abandon” contemporary perspectives in deference to the “vantage point” of the people living when the Constitution was adopted; and 2) the original meaning of the Constitution does not change.     Most modern originalists, including the late Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, would agree with tenBroek’s description of originalist assumptions. Scalia spent years touring the country telling audiences that the Constitution, far from being a living document, was “dead, dead, dead. ”   “New Originalists” like Georgetown University’s Randy Barnett, who, unlike Scalia, concede that originalism often runs out in hard cases before “constitutional construction” begins, also believe that the meaning of the Constitution doesn’t change. In Barnett’s words, “an originalist simply could not accept that the Supreme Court could change the meaning of the text from what it meant as enacted and still remain an originalist. ”  TenBroek demonstrated, however, that the original meaning of the Constitution in fact changes all the time in the hands of judges and justices (as it should, to keep up with modern conditions).  In the space of just a few years, tenBroek observed, minimum wage laws for women were first held to be unconstitutional as being beyond the police power of the state and then upheld as rationally related to legitimate economic concerns. Pointing to the reversal of numerous important cases by the   Deal Court, tenBroek observed that these “changes in the meaning of the Constitution did not result from altered judicial views as to the original intent; they came rather from a different prevailing attitude in the Court with respect to economic, social, and political policy. ” Modern originalists have signed on to many doctrines that are not justifiable on originalist grounds  Modern originalists might respond that the justices who upheld significant economic regulation after the initial rejection of many New Deal programs misread and changed the scope of the commerce clause and other sources of federal power. Strikingly, however, doctrinal changes are often agreed to by   originalist justices who vote for   interpretations (without admitting it).             For example, for many years the Supreme Court gave little or no judicial protection to commercial speech rights of corporations or the desires of state governments to be immune from direct congressional regulation (commandeering). Recently, however, with Justices Scalia and Thomas agreeing, the Court has changed its mind on both issues with little regard to the original meaning of the relevant constitutional provisions.  In fact, as I have argued elsewhere, the list of   results advocated by these two justices is quite long and cuts through large swaths of constitutional law including affirmative action, takings, campaign finance reform, standing, and sovereign immunity. Many of these changes overturned prior Supreme Court cases. Judge Posner is right: No Supreme Court Justice, including Scalia and Thomas, has ever employed originalism on a consistent basis    Some   “New Originalist” scholars argue that even though the meaning of the constitutional text does not change, that meaning will inevitably be applied by judges to new conditions, a process that will produce evolving constitutional decisions. As noted earlier, Randy Barnett calls this “constitutional construction. ” If a case cannot be decided by way of the original meaning of the text, Barnett says, judge should look to the “spirit” of the text. He describes the search for this “spirit” as an empirical inquiry and contends (implausibly) that this search is less   than theories of constitutional interpretation advanced by  . A “new originalism” has emerged that reads the Constitution through a libertarian lens But this is an originalist argument in name only. Professor Barnett’s “constitutional construction” is just another form of “living constitutionalism,” given that identifying the “spirit” of vague constitutional provisions with contested histories allows judges and scholars to advocate for just about any and all results.  In Barnett’s hands, for example, our Constitution’s “spirit” is overwhelmingly libertarian, and would bar much economic regulation that we now take for granted. That “spirit” also justifies a strong Second Amendment and even allows judges to use the historically ignored Ninth Amendment to find and enforce fundamental rights. It is no coincidence that all of these ideas are consistent with Barnett’s personal worldview, as I argued in a review of his latest book. In recent years, numerous   new originalists have reached the remarkable conclusions that, based on originalism,   marriage is required under the 14th Amendment while affirmative action is barred under the same provision even though there are no strong arguments that the people who ratified the 14th Amendment would have agreed with either conclusion. These scholars want to don the originalism mantle while at the same time avoid being locked into the specific results that the original ratifiers of our Constitution and its amendments would have expected. In other words, they want to argue they are using originalist arguments at the same time that they disavow the obvious consequences of originalism for many modern problems. We all agree that specific constitutional requirements, such as there must be “two” senators from every state or the president must be “35,” must be enforced strictly and without regard to changing facts. But if words and phrases like “equal protection of the laws,” “due process of law,” and “freedom of speech” can lead to different judicial conclusions at different times because of different modern conditions (which Barnett and other new originalists have conceded) then there is no difference between originalists and   for any case likely to be litigated. This conclusion is consistent with tenBroeks’s study showing judges will reach the results they think best whether or not they are justified by the original meaning of the Constitution. On March 20, when the confirmation hearings are scheduled to begin, Judge Gorsuch and the United States Senate are going to play an elaborate trick on the American people (just as Justice Scalia did for years). They will pretend that the original meaning of the Constitution is what judges both use and should use to resolve hard constitutional questions. Gorsuch has said, “Judges should   …     strive (if humanly and so imperfectly) to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be. ”    But Gorsuch does not make decisions like that now, and he will not make decisions that way if he makes it to the Supreme Court. The confirmation process will have been a sham because, as tenBroek demonstrated almost 80 years ago, the justices don’t decide cases that way, and they shouldn’t decide cases that way. The original meaning of the text, if there even is such a thing in hard cases, is but one small factor in a complex assessment of how an ancient document should govern modern times, and original meaning pales (and should pale) as a determinant of decisions, compared with the politics, morals, and values of a majority of the justices on the Supreme Court.

"How Hyperinflation Destroys Much More Than Just Currencies. In November 1923, there were 4,210,500,000,000 German marks to the dollar. 4.2 trillion. In lay economics, 1 : 4.2 trillion equals worthless. Such a ruinous currency devaluation exacts steep psychic tolls. Like a startup expensively acquiring users on a thin promise of future monetization, Germany had one operating principle during World War I: hubris. Pumping fiat money into circulation, the government insisted that the resources it was about to win would wipe out its debts. When the Central Powers surrendered on November 11, 1918, not only was the nation’s credit maxed, it had reparations to pay. ",0.0
"A fitting final chapter to 2016’s sleaze sweepstakes.  As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom, remember this: When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001, they took some White House furnishings that were public property. They also accepted more than $190, 000 in gifts, including two coffee tables and two chairs, a $7, 375 gratuity from Denise Rich, whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton’s final hours. A Post editorial (“Count the Spoons”) identified “the Clintons’ defining characteristic: They have no capacity for embarrassment. Words like shabby and tawdry come to mind. They don’t begin to do it justice. ”  Today, Hillary Clinton strives to live again among some White House furnishings that she and her helpmeet were compelled to disgorge. Her campaign flounders because when she was secretary of state some of the nation’s business might have been melded with the contents of a computer that is pertinent to an FBI investigation of a former Democratic congressman’s alleged sexual texting with a female minor. Ransack the English language for words to do this justice. During the recent welter of reports about the Clintons’   through their charity that has been very charitable to them, the New Yorker, reporting her plans to uplift the downtrodden, quoted her aspiration: “I want to really marry the public and the private sector. ” This would solve the Clintons’ problem of discerning the line between public business and private aggrandizement: Erase the line.  So, herewith the United States’ choice. Restore the House of Clinton. Or confer executive powers  —   powers that President Obama by his audacity, and Congress by its lethargy, have proved to be essentially unlimited  —   on another competitor in the sleaze sweepstakes, Donald Trump, who shares his opponent’s disinclination to disentangle the personal and the political. Into this political maelstrom, FBI Director James B. Comey injected an announcement that intensified the chaos without providing a scintilla of news that voters can use: An unknown number of emails of unknown provenance and unknown content might be “pertinent” to an investigation that already has established, beyond peradventure, that   Clinton was “extremely careless” with sensitive material.         Add the FBI, and the Justice Department to which it belongs, to the carnage of institutions that is a byproduct of bad judgments by the political class that have voters asking Casey Stengel’s question. In 1962, Stengel, manager of the New York Mets, an expansion team en route to a record of 120 losses, looked down his dugout at his woebegone players and wondered aloud, “Can’t anybody here play this game?”  It is grimly hilarious to hear it said that the Justice Department, by not holding Comey to established protocols concerning discussions of ongoing investigations, and concerning pronouncements close to elections, has tainted itself. Obamacare would not have passed if Justice Department lawyers had not conducted what a federal judge declared a corrupt prosecution of Alaska’s Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, costing him reelection. The department has enabled, by not seriously investigating, the IRS’s suppression of political advocacy by conservative groups. Or of the IRS’s subsequent destruction of subpoenaed emails pertinent to this. So, unsurprisingly, the most intrusive and potentially punitive federal agency continues to punish conservative groups for being conservative, according to Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer for political groups who confirms there are indeed conservative organizations who were targeted by the IRS and have still not received their   status. In 2013, President Obama professed himself “angry” about “inexcusable” IRS behavior, before he decided there was not a “smidgen” of IRS corruption. He claimed to have learned about the IRS behavior from the media. Now he claims that he learned from the media about Clinton’s email abuses, although they had exchanged emails using her private server. Perhaps. The defining scandal of the Obama era has been the media’s lackadaisical consensus that Obama’s administration has had no serious scandal. This, although with the Justice Department protecting the IRS, the administration has (in the words of Richard Nixon’s White House counsel John Dean) used “the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies. ”  Clinton, the ultimate author of her current agony, resembles no one so much as Nixon in her paranoia and joyless pursuit of joy. Her government career began with the House committee preparing Nixon’s impeachment.   years earlier, he had saved his career by addressing a supposed scandal with his nationally broadcast “Checkers speech,” which was mawkish, abasing and effective. How fitting it would be for a Clinton “Checkers speech” to end our long national nightmare that this campaign has been.  Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.

"The financial costs of America’s culture wars are skyrocketing.  The culture wars are getting very, very expensive. Once upon a time, politicians could use wedge issues to score cheap political points, emphasis on “cheap. ” Put a gay rights issue on the ballot, or pass an antiabortion bill, and you could turn out the base at   prices. Even better, with minimal risk to the public fisc, you might be able to distract voters from other, thornier problems. Facing a public education crisis? Take a page from North Carolina, and pass a law regulating where and when people can pee. Is your state so broke it’s shaving days off the school year? Copy Kansas, and implement some draconian antiabortion legislation.   The Supreme Court struck down Texas’ widely replicated regulation of abortion clinics June 27. Lieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick called the ruling a ”a devastating blow to women’s safety and health.” (AP)   Have the highest uninsured population of any state? Look to Texas, and pass even more draconian antiabortion legislation. Are your constituents unhappy with declining economic opportunities? Check out Indiana, Arkansas and Georgia, among others, and introduce legislation to make it easier to discriminate against gay men and lesbians. Has your state’s credit been downgraded nine times? Is your governor facing a sex scandal? Have you become the nation’s tragicomic punchline? Find role models in New Jersey, Alabama and Florida, respectively, and join the crusade against Planned Parenthood. It all sounds relatively inexpensive. Lately, though, the ammo required in these culture wars has proved costlier than politicians, or their constituents, may have counted on. In North Carolina, legislators last week voted to transfer $500, 000 from the state’s emergency response and disaster relief fund to pay for litigation of the   bathroom bill. Good thing there are never any hurricanes in the Tar Heel State, and there’s no chance of a Zika crisis in its   coastal tourism areas. Legal fees are likewise mounting in states that have attempted to bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds (which often turns out to violate federal Medicaid law) to implement constitutionally dicey restrictions on abortion access, or both. Alabama, for example, recently had to pay $51, 000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit over the state’s brief attempt to cancel Planned Parenthood Southeast’s Medicaid contract. In recent years,   Kansas has spent more than $1 million  defending its suite of antiabortion laws, including one that’s now on hold after the Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas law. Texas, for its part, spent $1 million defending that doomed law.  In the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling, at least seven other states are facing renewed legal challenges. And of course in some cases, such legal expenses are peanuts compared with the broader economic costs of these   laws. After North Carolina passed its   bathroom bill,   musicians such as Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts, companies such as PayPal and Deutsche Bank withdrew plans to expand in the state, and events and trade shows were called off . The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimated that the law could cost the state nearly $600 million in   economic activity through 2018. Another $4. 8 billion in federal grants and contracts is also at risk, primarily in funding for schools, colleges and universities, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, a think tank that studies   policy issues. Needless to say, an expensive fight can still be a worthwhile and even morally righteous one. I may believe some of these particular battles are misguided, or motivated by fear and bigotry, or by politicians’ cynical attempts to capitalize on voters’ fear and bigotry. But I can certainly imagine other social issues I’d want my elected officials to defend even if the fight proved long and costly. That said, politicians ought to be transparent about what they’re sticking taxpayers with when they choose to wage such culture wars. Economic impact estimates are often more art than science, but minimum litigation costs at least are easier to estimate. Particularly when a state is considering a policy that has already come under serious legal challenge elsewhere. And especially when a state is considering a measure that courts have already repeatedly struck down, as with attempts to   welfare recipients, or to bar patients from seeing the qualified and willing Medicaid provider of their choice if that provider is Planned Parenthood. So here’s an idea: Any time legislators pass a law already facing a major legal challenge in another state, they should have to set aside funding for its defense. It’s time to remind voters that in the constitutionally fraught culture wars  —   as in everything else  —   there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

"The charges against anti-Planned Parenthood filmmaker, explained.        In a surprise move, Texas authorities leveled criminal charges against the   activists behind a series of undercover videos targeting Planned Parenthood, which sparked fiery debate last year nationwide and on Capitol Hill. Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson, a Republican, said David Daleiden, the director of the Center for Medical Progress, faces a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count related to buying human tissue. Sandra Merritt, one of his employees, also was indicted on a charge of tampering with a governmental record. Arrest warrants have been issued for activists, with a bond amount of $10, 000. They can be arrested in any state. The grand jury, meanwhile, cleared Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast of any wrongdoing. By way of background, Daleiden’s team posed as biomedical employees and wore body cameras to secretly shoot video of Planned Parenthood clinics and employees. They recorded officials discussing the logistics of donating fetal tissue from abortions to researchers, who use human organs to develop new medications. Daleiden claimed the footage proved Planned Parenthood was illegally selling fetal tissue for profit  —   a charge the organization has denied. Although Planned Parenthood has apologized for the casual tone its employees took in the videos, the organization said it will continue to donate tissue to scientists. It will no longer, however, collect fees to cover the cost of transfering the tissue, which ranges between $25 to $50 per donation. Initially, the grand jury set out to investigate Planned Parenthood. But on Monday, it instead returned charges against Daleiden. Harris County prosecutors declined to explain the charges. But Josh Schaffer, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood in Houston, says this is what it all means: Charge: Tampering with a governmental record Daleiden has admitted to putting together a fake company he dubbed Biomax Procurement Services. His group assumed aliases and claimed to provide fetal tissue to researchers. The fake IDs used by Daleiden and Merritt, which look like California licenses, triggered the felony charge,  Schaffer said. The IDs appeared in Harris County court documents. Daleiden went by Robert Sarkis.    Courtesy of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office  Merritt operated under the name Susan Tennenbaum.    Courtesy of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office  They used the cards to get into a Planned Parenthood center in Houston, Schaffer said, which prompted state officials to open an investigation into the clinic after the video was released in August. “They presented those to security at the Planned Parenthood office to gain access to the facility for the meeting they’d scheduled with the intent to defraud or harm Planned Parenthood,” he said. “They secretly videotaped meetings and edited the tapes to be taken out of context. ” Intent to cause harm is what elevated the possession of fake IDs to a more serious felony charge than, say, a    trying to buy a   would receive, Schaffer said. Under Texas law, the charge carries a penalty of two to 20 years in prison.    Planned Parenthood announced on Jan. 14 it is suing the Center for Medical Progress, the group responsible for heavily edited and secretly filmed videos claiming the abortion provider illegally sells fetal tissue. Here’s what they want. (The Washington Post)   Charge: Attempting to buy human tissue  Using his false identity, Daleiden emailed Planned Parenthood in June, asking to buy fetal tissue for $1, 600, Schaffer said. The email was included in court evidence, the lawyer said, but cannot be released to the public during an active case. Whether Daleiden actually intended to buy tissue doesn’t matter in the eyes of Texas law. The inquiry alone could have spurred the misdemeanor charge. Authorities don’t need to see evidence of a deal or interest from another party to pursue the charge. Planned Parenthood, Schaffer said, never responded to Daleiden’s email. “He probably didn’t know he was breaking the law,” Schaffer added. The charge is a misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of up to one year in county jail. Shortly after the charges were announced, Steven Ertelt, the editor of LifeNews. com, sent out a petition asking people to “help David Daleiden. ” “Instead of prosecuting Planned Parenthood for selling aborted baby parts, Daleiden was indicted for buying them,” he wrote. “If convicted, Daleiden faces 20 years in prison while Planned Parenthood officials face no legal consequences for their actions. ” In a statement Monday evening, the Center for Medical Progress said it “uses the same undercover techniques that investigative journalists have used for decades in exercising our First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and of the press, and follows all applicable laws. We respect the processes of the Harris County District Attorney, and note that buying fetal tissue requires a seller as well. Planned Parenthood still cannot deny the admissions from their leadership about fetal organ sales captured on video for all the world to see. ” Planned Parenthood applauded the grand jury’s decision and said Daleiden’s work used deceptive edits to unfairly implicate them in a crime. “These antiabortion extremists spent three years creating a fake company, creating fake identities, lying and breaking the law,” said Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “When they couldn’t find any improper or illegal activity, they made it up. ” The videos reinvigorated the debate over the use of fetal tissue procured through abortions and became the subject of a   investigation into Planned Parenthood on Capitol Hill. Republican presidential candidates have also seized on the footage, calling for Congress to defund the organization, while Democratic contenders argue that women’s health and access to abortion should be protected. Several states  —   including Florida, Indiana, Missouri and Washington  —   opened investigations into Planned Parenthood last year but found no evidence the organization sold tissue for profit. None sought criminal charges against the creators of the viral videos, which garnered millions of views and provided fodder for Republicans who oppose abortion.  *A previous version of this article missed the “n” in Steven Ertelt’s name.",-0.5
"The arrow of history.  How do you distinguish a foreign policy “idealist” from a “realist,” an optimist from a pessimist? Ask one question: Do you believe in the arrow of history? Or to put it another way, do you think history is cyclical or directional? Are we condemned to do the same damn thing over and over, generation after generation  —   or is there hope for some enduring progress in the world order?  For realists, generally conservative, history is an endless cycle of clashing power politics. The same patterns repeat. Only the names and places change. The best we can do in our own time is to defend ourselves, managing instability and avoiding catastrophe. But expect nothing permanent, no essential alteration in the course of human affairs. The idealists believe otherwise. They believe that the international system can eventually evolve out of its Hobbesian state of nature into something more humane and hopeful. What is usually overlooked is that this hopefulness for achieving a higher plane of global comity comes in two flavors  —   one liberal, one conservative. The liberal variety (as practiced, for example, by the Bill Clinton administration) believes that the creation of a dense web of treaties, agreements, transnational institutions and international organizations (such as the U. N. NGOs, the World Trade Organization) can give substance to a cohesive community of nations that would, in time, ensure order and stability. The conservative view (often called neoconservative and dominant in the George W. Bush years) is that the better way to ensure order and stability is not through international institutions, which are flimsy and generally powerless, but through the spread of democracy. Because, in the end, democracies are inherently more inclined to live in peace.   President Obama called for an end to nuclear weapons in a solemn visit to Hiroshima to offer respects to the victims of the world’s first deployed atomic bomb. (Reuters)   Liberal internationalists count on globalization, neoconservatives on democratization to get us to the sunny uplands of international harmony. But what unites them is the belief that such uplands exist and are achievable. Both believe in the perfectibility, if not of man, then of the international system. Both believe in the arrow of history. For realists, this is a comforting delusion that gives high purpose to international exertions where none exists. Sovereign nations remain in incessant pursuit of power and  . The pursuit can be carried out more or less wisely. But nothing fundamentally changes. Barack Obama is a classic case study in foreign policy idealism. Indeed, one of his favorite quotations is about the arrow of history: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. ” He has spent nearly eight years trying to advance that arc of justice. Hence his initial “apology tour,” that burst of confessional   abroad about America and its sins, from slavery to the loss of our moral compass after  . Friday’s trip to Hiroshima completes the arc. Unfortunately, with “justice” did not come peace. The policies that followed  —   appeasing Vladimir Putin, the Iranian mullahs, the butchers of Tiananmen Square and lately the Castros  —   have advanced neither justice nor peace. On the contrary. The consequent withdrawal of American power, that agent of injustice or at least arrogant overreach, has yielded nothing but geopolitical chaos and immense human suffering. (See Syria.)  But now an interesting twist. Two terms as president may not have disabused Obama of his    idealism (see above: Hiroshima visit) but they have forced upon him at least one policy of hardheaded, indeed hardhearted, realism. On his Vietnam trip this week, Obama accepted the reality of an abusive dictatorship while announcing a warming of relations and the lifting of the U. S. arms embargo, thereby enlisting Vietnam as a full partner in the containment of China. This follows the partial return of the U. S. military to the Philippines, another element of the containment strategy. Indeed, the   Partnership itself is less about economics than geopolitics, creating a Pacific Rim cordon around China. There’s no idealism in containment. It is raw, soulless realpolitik. No moral arc. No uplifting historical arrow. In fact, it is the same damn thing all over again, a recapitulation of Truman’s containment of Russia in the late 1940s. Obama is doing the same, now with China.          Obama also visited Hiroshima, the Japanese city where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in 1945.    Caption   The president arrived in Japan for the Group of Seven summit, where the leaders of the seven advanced economies are meeting for two days.

"House turns into battleground over LGBT rights.      The House floor is turning into an emotional, and at times ugly, battleground over LGBT rights, as Democrats accuse Republicans of promoting bigotry and discrimination over proposals GOP leaders say are intended to protect freedom of religion from government overreach. The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal, authored by Rep. Sean Maloney ( . Y.) appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a    vote. Outraged Democrats shouted “shame” and accused Republican leaders of abusing chamber rules by holding the vote open until they could twist enough arms to kill the amendment.   How can a 2 min vote become an 8 min vote? When you need to work for 6 mins to keep discriminating vs #LGBT. Watch: https:  .   —   Jim Himes (@jahimes) May 19, 2016  “They literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality,” Maloney said. “We won this vote. ” Maloney told reporters that when he saw House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( .) “personally twisting arms on the floor,” he asked him to let the vote conclude only to be told to “to get back on my own side” of the aisle. In protest, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( .) took to the microphone to rail against Republicans as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( .) walked around the Democrats’ side of the floor waving a red vote card and urging her members to vote no on the underlying military construction and veterans programs spending bill so that Republicans “get the message. ” The spending bill subsequently was passed on a    vote, with 57 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. The House fracas comes as a national debate is underway over LGBT rights. The battle has reached a fever pitch in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a measure to ban transgender individuals from using a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. Corporations boycotted the state after the measure was enacted, and the federal government and North Carolina have now slapped competing lawsuits against each other. [North Carolina, Justice Dept. file dueling lawsuits over transgender rights] Tensions over the issue in the House surfaced in recent weeks when a provision was added to the annual defense policy bill by Rep. Steve Russell ( .) that would exempt religious organizations that contract with the federal government from certain parts of civil rights law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Democrats and some moderate Republicans decried the proposal, but earlier this week GOP leaders blocked them from holding a vote to strip the language from the defense bill when it was on the floor. The battle then moved to Thursday when the chamber considered one of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which historically have been allowed to have a more   amendment process. The vote on Thursday is just one chapter in a fight that promises to occupy Congress in the coming weeks as both Republicans and Democrats plan further legislative measures to force the House to take a stand on the divide over whether certain policies, such as those concerning hiring practices and public bathrooms, amount to LGBT discrimination or protections for freedom of religion. When and where the fight will be waged remains murky. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) on Thursday declined to say whether Republicans would bring up measures to curtail the Obama administration’s efforts on LGBT rights, which include his recent directive to schools to accommodate transgender students in the bathrooms of their choosing. Ryan told reporters only that that such matters “should be left up to the states. ” But Ryan “is engaged in understanding” how the House will try to push back on the transgender bathrooms issue, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions ( ) said. “We’ve encouraged him, I’ve encouraged him, he’s been encouraged,” he added. One option may be a new bill from Rep. Luke Messer ( .) which seeks to block President Obama’s executive order on transgender bathrooms by preventing the administration from withholding federal funding from schools that don’t comply with the order. Messer said Thursday he is looking for   vehicles as potential avenues for the legislation, such as appropriations bills. “I can assure you we’ll try to do something in appropriations on this issue for sure,” said Rep. Tom Cole ( .) a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and a close ally of its chairman and the Speaker. According to a new   poll, the country is divided almost evenly with 46 percent of all people answering that transgender people should use the bathroom corresponding to the gender with which they were born and 41 percent believing they should use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender with which they identify. There is a stark partisan divide, however:   of Republicans and 66 percent conservatives say that transgender people should use the restroom corresponding to their gender at birth, while 60 percent of Democrats and 71 percent of liberals say they should be able to use the restroom with which they identify. As Republicans cue up measures to push back on the president’s   orders, Democrats said to exploit any divisions within the GOP  —   or short of that, expose them. “These things are going to be remembered,” Maloney said of the Republicans who switched their votes, likening the act to being on “the wrong side of the march toward Selma” and “standing in the schoolhouse door” to prevent the integration of schools. He said these lawmakers would “have this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers. ”",-0.5
"Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on Maps, AI, Ads, and Ambient Navigation. The future of Google Maps is one in which algorithms are drawing buildings, AR is helping you decide what to eat, and Google Maps technology exists more broadly outside of the actual Google Maps app. That's all according to Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company. In an interview with WIRED on Wednesday, Pichai said that Maps in particular has been a fertile testing ground for the ""AI-first"" approach he started pushing for when he became CEO of Google in 2015. Pichai's statements come just as Google Maps is celebrating its 15th birthday—the service launched on February 8, 2005. To coincide with the anniversary, Google is releasing a global update to the Maps app. It's not a dramatic redesign, but it moves some of the more hidden features of the apps, like a Contributions tab and an Updates tab, into the main page of Maps. It also makes one of the app's newer augmented-reality features more readily available. Pichai's remarks on Maps also come as Google endures intense scrutiny from regulators over its digital advertising business. Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the US Justice Department is studying the market dominance of the company's DoubleClick platform. Maps is not a significant source of revenue for the company, but it is one of the Google products that does serve up advertising. When asked about the current investigation, Pichai says the company plans to ""constructively engage"" in conversations on these matters. ""We provide platforms, and we provide them in many different contexts,"" says Pichai, who recently took on an expanded role as CEO of all of Alphabet. ""I've said this before: I think with scale, it makes sense that things are looked at. Our goal is to show what we are doing, and I think we go to great lengths to make sure the DoubleClick platform is done in a way in which the majority of revenue through those platforms goes to publishers ... to the extent there's feedback on something that needs to be done differently, we've shown we will incorporate that."" The Maps redesign is intended to showcase the company's more ambitious map functions, and, according to Dane Glasgow, VP of product at Google Maps, it comes in response to the evolving needs of Maps users. In its earliest days, Maps was mostly a digital representation of an atlas. The perfect storm of GPS-enabled smartphones, Street View technology, and user-generated data helped the platform rapidly evolve. And as it gained more and more features, that bloat got stuffed behind a hamburger menu in the top corner. This new redesign is supposed to simplify things. The app icon itself is getting overhauled: Instead of a mini map, it's now a Googly-colored pin. The main screen of the app now shows five new tabs: Explore, Commute, Saved Places, Contribute, and Updates (for the latest buzz about nearby goings-on). Other options in the app present themselves to the user based on context. ""As we introduce things like more data about restaurants, for example, they're gonna ask, 'What's the best pizza place to go to?'"" Glasgow says. ""Increasingly, people are recognizing that they can ask more and more information about the world."" Commute and public transit options are getting an update. If you're plotting out a trip to work, additional settings will pop up during route selection that include factors like accessibility, security presence, and temperature of a train car. In some markets, women-only transit cars will be identified. These factors are assessed, Waze-like, from information provided by other Maps users. Google first added crowdedness predictions to Maps last year. The newer screening options are slated to roll out in March, though that will vary based on region. Immediately available, however, is Google's reemphasized augmented-reality mode. The company first showed off Live View at its software developer conference in 2018 and started rolling it out in 2019. The feature itself hasn't changed much—hold up your phone and arrows appear within the camera view to point you in the right direction. But now, AR will be available in Maps without starting navigation. People can search for a nearby store or museum, and Live Mode will be ready to activate with a single tap, instead of requiring the user to launch the directions feature first. This seems simple enough from the description, but augmented reality requires a staggering amount of data behind the scenes to function properly. It's built on top of existing Street View data, which is gathered by the sensor- and camera-laden cars that Google started to deploy way back in 2007. Live View also scoops up data from users' cameras as they're tapping into the AR feature. A GPS signal isn't enough to determine exactly where you're facing, so Live View uses machine learning to compare the scene captured by your camera to the billions of Street view images and other user contributions. ""Overall, I think computing should work in a way where it's much more intuitive to the way people live and not the other way around,"" Pichai says. ""AR and Maps is really in the sweet spot of that, because as humans we're walking around the world, perceiving a lot, trying to understand a lot."" Pichai says he sees a future in which Maps users are walking around and an AR layer of information is popping up in Maps, showing them vegetarian menu options at nearby restaurants. That doesn't mean AR in Google Maps works like magic now—or will in the near future. ""We talk about the double-edge sword of AR,"" says Alex Komoroske, director of product management at Maps. ""If you get it exactly right, it's extremely intuitive. But if we get it wrong, it is actively confusing. It's worse than showing nothing."" To keep up with its own grand Maps vision, Google has come to rely on these kinds of machine-learning programs to decipher complicated infrastructure at a global scale. Through test cases in India and Nigeria over the past couple of years, Maps engineers have used ML models to map out roadways and determine building outlines based on satellite imagery. Pichai says that in the last year alone, Google has mapped as many building exteriors as it did cumulatively in the 10 years prior. He also says he sees AI being deployed horizontally across Google Maps features, not just in assigning street names and outlining buildings. Those examples range from showing people the popular dishes people are eating at a restaurant when you look up directions to that spot, to predicting much more critical situations—earthquakes, hurricanes, heavy rainfalls, or floods. ""Obviously, there's a lot of work to be done in those areas,"" Pichai says, but he believes those predictive models could be in Google Maps in as soon as three to five years. In addition to spending billions on its own mapping data, Google relies heavily on user contributions to contextualize the glut of new information. It's one thing to map a spiderweb network of dirt roads in the mountains of India, but quite another to know what they're named. Google says users provide 20 million bits of content every day, but there's always a need for more. Hence the prominent new Contribute tab on the Maps main screen. The increasing emphasis on personal interaction loops within the Maps—users voluntarily adding images and street names, detailing live updates of their travels, reviewing restaurants, uploading videos of their surroundings to Google's servers—underscores that the success of Google Maps depends heavily on whether people keep using Maps, and not, say, opt for the much more private Apple Maps instead. Google Maps is gleaning data from its users whether they're actively contributing critical information, navigating in the app, or simply tapping to access the new Live View feature. (And remember that Google has gotten into trouble for tracking some users' locations even after those users have asked it not to.) For the past several years, the Google Maps experience has largely involved opening up a discrete app, especially on mobile phones. Pichai envisions a future in which the information from Google Maps is much more ""ambiently"" available. He says he believes Google's Maps API, or, the communication protocol that allows different apps to connect to one another, will be used in more apps that have nothing to do with mapping—but might require navigation in a non-obvious way. A retail store or an entire mall could offer a unique shopping experience, he cited as an example, and the information is presented by that brand, but the navigation technology is provided by Google. (When I asked about what this means for Google's dominance in ads, Pichai pointed out that Google offers an API licensing model that doesn't require ad hosting.) ""So [Maps] becomes more than just always being a destination. It's about getting the right experience, and I think it needs to get more intuitive, more natural,"" Pichai says. That naturally raises questions about the future of Maps as they might exist on non-smartphone devices, like AR glasses—something that Google was early on but hasn't had tremendous success with. On that, Pichai declined to comment.",0.0
"Did a Woman Get Coronavirus Twice? Scientists Are Skeptical. What could be worse than getting the pneumonia-like illness now known as Covid-19? Getting it twice. That’s what Japanese government officials say may have happened to a female tour bus guide in Osaka. The woman was first diagnosed with Covid-19 in late January, according to a statement released by Osaka’s prefectural government Wednesday. She was discharged shortly after, once her symptoms had improved. A subsequent test came back negative for the virus. Three weeks later she returned with a sore throat and chest pain and tested again. For a second time, she tested positive for Covid-19. Read all of our coronavirus coverage here. News reports detailing the case raised the possibility that people may not be developing immunity to the new coronavirus, even after they’ve recovered. But several infectious disease specialists say there’s not enough data to support that conclusion. Another possibility is that the virus subsided and flared up again. (Some viruses tend to do that.) Or the test was simply wrong. “The question is really: How good is the proof?” says Donald Burke, an international health expert at the University of Pittsburgh. “And we’re a long way away from anything solid. What we need is the sequence of the virus.” The only way to differentiate between a relapse—meaning the same coronavirus seemed to go away and came back—and reinfection, in which a second strain of coronavirus swooped in just as the first cleared out, is a full viral sequence. The tests currently available for diagnosing Covid-19 are based on a method called RT-PCR, which picks up some pieces of the virus’s genetic code, but not everything. It’s designed to grab only the chunks that are unique to the new coronavirus, but stable enough that they won’t disappear if it mutates. Thanks to some specialized fluorescent dye, the more viral bits there are, the brighter the genetic material glows, creating a pattern of light that signals for the presence of the virus. In theory, if doctors completely sequenced the virus in a patient’s nose or mouth swab at the time of each positive diagnosis, they could compare each genetic letter using genome-reading software and determine if the person had the same strain of coronavirus or a new one. Without that kind of data, says Burke, there’s no way of knowing for sure. But others think the more likely scenario is that the virus can just linger in some people’s bodies longer than expected. “I suspect this is in fact a continuation of the original infection,” says Susan Kline, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. For one thing, she says, just not enough time has elapsed for reinfection. In the case of the other coronaviruses people catch, like the ones that cause the common cold, people tend to develop immunity following an infection. But it doesn’t last forever. The body produces antibodies that are protective against subsequent exposures, and then over time that immune response wanes, says Kline. That process usually takes longer than three weeks. “It’s too soon,” says Kline. “This entire outbreak has only been going on for two months. I would be very surprised if people are getting reinfected in that time span.” So why then, did the Japanese woman test negative? Kline says there are a few potential explanations. One is that the test wasn’t sensitive enough to pick up traces of the virus. The RT-PCR tests currently in use for diagnosing Covid-19 require a fair amount of genetic material to work well. If the coronavirus is actively making more copies of itself, there will be lots of RNA for the test to detect. But if the viral load goes down, the test can give false negatives. That can happen because the patient’s immune system is mounting a strong response. Or it could be that a treatment is slowing down the coronavirus’s self-replication spree. Another possibility is that the sample was just bad—the swab didn’t pick up much virus in the first place. Other viruses are known to exhibit similar dynamics. HIV, for example, starts out with a burst of viral replication before the immune system is alerted to its presence. Once the body starts to mount a response, the amount of viral genetic material drops, sometimes below detectable levels. Then as HIV attacks the body’s immune cells and patients get sicker and sicker, it becomes detectable again. During the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, there were reports of people who were given steroids to clear up their pneumonia. Those treatments caused the SARS virus to drop off, before coming back again later. The Osaka case, which was first reported by Reuters, is the first time anyone in Japan has been reported to have—maybe—caught the coronavirus more than once. But similar cases have also been reported in China, which is still the epicenter of an outbreak that has infected more than 83,000 globally and killed 2,858, according to the World Health Organization’s latest numbers. Last month, a Chinese physician warned that it was possible for recovered patients to contract the virus again. Speaking at a Chinese National Health Commission briefing on January 30, Zhan Quingyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, said that while Covid-19 patients all seem to generate antibodies against the coronavirus, in some individuals the antibodies don’t appear to last for very long. “For those patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse,” Zhan said. Burke says he’s keeping an eye on this, and any other data that emerges suggesting people are relapsing from Covid-19 or catching multiple strains. Both could have potentially huge consequences for the public health response to the outbreak. “If there were an appreciable number of genuine relapses, I would be concerned about how you decide when it’s safe to take a person out of containment,” says Burke. Health workers would need to adapt monitoring strategies to make sure people aren’t reactivating and becoming infectious again once they’ve recovered and are back in their communities. And the spectre of reinfection raises a host of other potential problems. “If the natural infection doesn’t give you solid immunity, then we would start to worry about the effectiveness of a vaccine,” says Burke. Of course, at this point, all of that is just speculation. For now, the best advice anyone has to offer is the same thing the Japanese government told its own citizens in Osaka: Wash your hands, and practice good cough etiquette.",0.0
"The Trump strategy for success? Fire everyone..  If there has been one unifying theme to Donald Trump’s campaign, it’s probably this: Throw the bums out. Unfortunately, that is not exactly a concrete set of policy proposals, nor is it a coherent governing philosophy. Despite what you may learn watching “The Apprentice,” you can’t just fire your way to success. Still, Trump seems to think there is no problem that can’t be solved through layoffs. At Wednesday night’s    Forum, for example, NBC’s Matt Lauer asked the Republican nominee about his declaration that within his first 30 days in office, his “top generals” would submit a plan for “soundly and quickly defeating ISIS. ” What use would that serve, Lauer asked, when Trump has said that he already knows more about the Islamic State than the generals do? “Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you,” Trump retorted, later adding that current personnel have led to “the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy. ” At no point did Trump provide guidance on what he’d be looking for in new military advisers  —   other than, of course, a public endorsement of Trump  —   or what his or their secret master plan for defeating the Islamic State should look like.  Just a few weeks earlier, Trump suggested he might soon be cleaning house in the country’s intelligence agencies, too. On Fox News, he said he didn’t trust the U. S. intelligence community and planned not to use “the people that are sort of your standards. ” It’s not just the national security apparatus that deserves to be purged, in Trump’s view. As president, he would also cleanse the entire executive branch of career civil servants appointed during President Obama’s tenure.  “As you know from his other career, Donald likes to fire people,” Trump adviser and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said while explaining the plan  —   which would require changing federal civil service law  —   during a   donor meeting at the Republican National Convention, according to Reuters. (On this objective, Trump could get beaten to the punch; if a January government survey is to be believed, 1 in 4 federal employees would consider voluntarily resigning if Trump were elected.) Trump’s pitch to voters is a broader application of this “fire everyone and don’t ask questions about their replacements” philosophy. Your lives suck, he tells voters, which means the whole system deserves to be burned down, and replaced with . . . something terrific. “Look at how much African American communities are suffering under Democratic control,” he said last month. “To those I say the following: What do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?”  In Trump’s pitch, establishment equals bad, new guy equals good  —   regardless of what that new guy stands for.   At least Trump practices what he preaches. Within his own campaign, he fired and replaced two campaign managers over two months, each time in an apparent response to declining poll numbers. As proof of Trump’s claim that he hires only “the best people,” the latest   lineup includes an accused sexual predator and the man who presided over the leading forum of the racist  .  But, hey, better the devil you don’t know than the devil you do, right? That’s the Trumpian worldview. Truly, I get the     impulse. It makes intuitive sense to look at disappointing outcomes and decide that something, and someone, needs to change. But smashing an unsatisfactory status quo without thinking deeply about who or what will succeed it is hardly a recipe for success.  Life would be easier if clearing out the dead wood were the same thing as planting new seedlings, if trimming the fat were the same as building muscle, if firing your defensive coordinator were the same as having a dominating NFL defense. But, sadly, that’s not how life works.  Schools can make it easier to fire bad teachers, but that doesn’t solve the problem of figuring out how to attract more good ones. Failing companies can ax their   staffers, but they still need to come up with a product people want to buy. And voters can replace an entire cadre of   establishment politicians with tea party novices, but that doesn’t mean those novices will render Congress any less dysfunctional.  Trump may well be right that the American people deserve something better than the current economic and political state of affairs. But “something better” is not the same thing as “something else. ” By all means, voters may have motive to throw the bums out; still, we ought to careful about what kind of new bums take their place.

"Former Obama and Bush CIA and State officials: Trump’s travel ban “undermines” national security.  A group of former CIA and US Department of State officials who worked under Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton on Sunday filed a legal brief against President Donald Trump’s immigration order, arguing that it “undermines the national security of the United States. ”    The brief, which officially opposes the order that halted refugee intake into the US for 120 days and travel from seven   countries for 90 days, was signed on to by mostly Democratic administration officials, including Obama and Clinton Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright. But it also includes one notable Republican official: Michael Hayden, the former CIA director who served under Bush and who has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s national security policies. It comes at a pivotal moment for the future of the controversial ban, which was put on hold on Friday by Judge James Robart of the Western District of Washington, barring its enforcement nationally, and kept on hold by a federals appeal court. The next step is for the lower and higher courts to consider whether the hold should be left in place or extended  —   particularly if Trump’s immigration order is deemed unconstitutional. The brief mixes a narrow counterterror argument  —   that it will boost ISIS and make American Muslims less likely to work with US military and law enforcement officials  —   with a broader assertion that it is a violation of fundamental American values:     [T]he Order disrupts thousands of lives, including those of refugees and visa holders all previously vetted by standing procedures that the Administration has not shown to be inadequate. It could do   damage to our national security and foreign policy interests, endangering U. S. troops in the field and disrupting counterterrorism and national security partnerships. It will aid ISIL’s propaganda effort and serve its recruitment message by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam. It will hinder relationships with the very communities that law enforcement professionals need to address the threat. It will have a damaging humanitarian and economic impact on the lives and jobs of American citizens and residents. And apart from all of these concerns, the Order offends our nation’s laws and values.    Furthermore, the brief states, there’s no evidence it will do anything to help national security (which has been explored at length by my colleague Jennifer Williams): Since September 11, 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order. Very few attacks on U. S. soil since September 11, 2001 have been traced to foreign nationals at all. The overwhelming majority of attacks have been committed by U. S. citizens. The Administration has identified no information or basis for believing there is now a heightened or particularized future threat from the seven named countries. Nor is there any rational basis for exempting from the ban particular religious minorities (e. g. Christians) suggesting that the real target of the ban remains one religious group (Muslims).    The brief fleshes out these arguments further, repeatedly emphasizing that the order will likely be seen as an insult to Muslims around the world in a way that could end up helping terrorist organizations.  It provides several examples: The order will make it easier for ISIS to claim that America and the West are in a deliberate war against Islam and Muslims  —   which is a key part of ISIS’s recruiting message. It will also make intelligence sources less willing to work for Americans, since they may no longer have an assurance that if something goes wrong in their home country, they can find safe refuge in the US. And it will alienate Muslim communities at home, making it harder for law enforcement to get the kind of cooperation they need to get in front of potential terrorist attacks. “To the extent that the Order bans travel by individuals cooperating against ISIL, we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message to those citizens and all Muslims,” the brief claims.    Pundits and politicians have made these types of arguments in the past few weeks against Trump’s immigration order, but this comes with a bit more weight since it’s coming from veteran national security officials who largely spent their careers in intelligence and defense roles, not in partisan politics. As they note, together these officials have “decades to combatting the various terrorist threats that the United States faces in a dynamic and dangerous world” with “the highest security clearances. ”  And with Hayden at the helm in particular, the brief also has a bipartisan sheen to it, suggesting this isn’t a solely Democratic concern. With that experience, the officials make their point clearly: Not only is Trump’s order unnecessary, it could very well endanger Americans  —   and the courts should prevent that.

"Trump supporters unwittingly wave Russian flags at CPAC.

"Kubo and the Two Strings is a gorgeous stop-motion homage to Kurosawa and the power of stories.  ”If you must blink, do it now.” So begins the gripping and gorgeous story of Kubo and the Two Strings, the latest film from the     animation studio Laika and an early comer for the best animated film of the year (and one of the best films of the year, period). A quintessential hero’s journey set in a dreamy, folkloric Japan, Kubo is a story about stories, told with a sophistication that never gets in the way of its straightforward earnestness or its stunning visuals.    It’s also fully  : The film knows that blinking is the last thing you’ll want to do while watching it.     Rating  4. 5                  Kubo and the Two Strings is the story of a young boy, Kubo (voiced by Game of Thrones’ Rickon Stark, Art Parkinson) who has a very special ability: the powerful inherited gift of   storytelling. The stories Kubo weaves for the spellbound audience in his small village and the magic he culls by playing his   shamisen are wondrous, but Kubo knows little about the extent of his powers. Instead, he spends most of his time caring for his convalescent mother, who never fully recovered from the death of Kubo’s father years ago, in an accident that cost Kubo one of his eyes.    Kubo doesn’t know what parts of the stories his mother tells him of his past, and of his mysterious family origins, are real  —   or why she insists that he never be caught outside of their tiny house after sundown. Soon he finds himself being pursued by his grandfather, the sinister Moon King, and his malevolent aunts, who slink through the sky like   kabuki ghosts.    To help him escape, his mother awakens the magic of a charmed snow monkey (Charlize Theron) and sends him on a journey to find a magical suit of armor that once belonged to his samurai father. A giant talking beetle, voiced by Matthew McConaughey of all people, is a surprisingly endearing, if mostly useless, addition to their troupe. But this is just the superficial quest. The real quest, the heart of Kubo’s journey, is a search for family, and perhaps even more, to find the truth behind every story. In this way, as well as in its nods to legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, Kubo is a Rashomon for the whole family: a tale that examines its own multiplicity and gently reminds us that every story looks different depending on who’s telling it.    Laika has gained a cult following over the past decade for its painstakingly wrought   animation and the vivid storytelling of its popular films Coraline and ParaNorman (and its less popular, but still excellent, The Boxtrolls). The studio’s CEO, Travis Knight, who served as lead animator for those films, makes his directorial debut with Kubo, working with a story by longtime industry artist Shannon Tindle and a script by Marc Haimes and ParaNorman writer Chris Butler. Knight’s direction lends a fluid grace to Kubo’s story, which weaves seamlessly back and forth between magical realism and pure fantasy. Under his deft touch, feudal Japan comes to life in bold strokes of color and light. But the stellar achievement of Kubo is the animation itself. Kubo took five years for the studio to perfect; animators and sculptors essentially handcrafted the film’s universe from scratch. Featuring intricate set design and a coterie of puppets, including the largest   puppet ever built, and a mix of old and new technology, Kubo feels vivid and alive. Shadows have teeth and pulse with raw danger. The gilded armor Kubo seeks sparkles and glitters like jewelry you could touch. An underwater sequence featuring an eerie eyeball garden is as unnerving as it is rich with beauty.    Kubo, perhaps more than any other animated film in the Western canon, has infused emotion into the animation itself. The yearning, the desire for connection, that drives Kubo on his journey is almost palpable in the somber, gorgeous sweep of deep hues that cover his village during the annual lighting of the floating lanterns, a real ceremony for the dead still practiced today in Japan. Dario Marianelli’s lavish, light score echoes the emotive properties of the art, doing its best to channel the refined aesthetic of Hayao Miyazaki’s longtime collaborator, composer Joe Hisaishi, without ever losing the dynamic, lively sensibility of a Kurosawa samurai epic. Knight has called Kubo a ”Kurosawa myth in miniature,” and there’s hardly a better way to describe how the film invokes heroic samurai tales of yore, even as it leaves you wondering what real truths lie behind Kubo’s quest. In this film, it’s easier to make origami folding paper take flight, easier to conquer a terrifying giant, than it is to make sense of familial loss and dysfunction. In its quieter moments, Kubo owes almost as much to legendary Japanese director Yasujirō Ozu, whose postwar anxieties expressed themselves through the silences that exist between mother and son, father and daughter. Kubo’s lush silences, too, often speak louder than its script. However, it’s difficult to ignore the fact that the primary creative team around Kubo isn’t Japanese. This is partly because the story itself feels fundamentally driven by Kurosawa’s own cultural borrowing of  ’  Westerns for its plot conflicts and character dynamics. It’s also because the main voice cast consists mostly of famed white celebrities; the    interjection of George Takei’s most famous catchphrase mostly just serves to distract from the story and highlight what small roles he and the other Japanese actors in the cast have.    This is a shame, not only because of the missed opportunity for a more authentic voice cast but because the film’s characterizations, in comparison to the sumptuous artistry of the rest of its elements, are Kubo’s weakest point. We know almost as little about Kubo and his family at the end of our journey as we did when we started. Kubo’s mother is wholly defined through her relationship to each of the men in her life, while her two terrifying sisters are essentially puppets for their father’s will. Kubo himself is as much a typical boy as you could expect from a   magical lute —  playing genius  —   but we’re never really sure, in the end, how he’s grown from his adventure. Of course, Kubo and the Two Strings is beautiful enough, and the story compelling enough, that such complaints feel like quibbling. Laika has once again set a new standard for animation, particularly for the blending of CGI and more traditional   animated effects. The result is a sumptuous array of visual delights, enough to do justice to traditional tales of knights in shining armor, runaway princesses, lost boys, and talking monkeys. Whether or not you leave the theater believing in Kubo’s story, you’ll surely wind up believing, as Kubo does, that a world without myriad stories  —   not to mention a world without myriad animation styles  —   is no world to live in at all.

"The problem with “don’t eat alone with women”: good character is better than strict rules.  Several years ago, a male colleague and I left a meeting on one side of campus at the university where we both teach to return to our offices, a   walk away. Since I had driven my car to the meeting, I asked my colleague if he’d like a ride back. After an almost imperceptible hesitation, he politely thanked me and said no.     Walking to my car, I suddenly realized I’d just had my first encounter with the “Billy Graham rule,” a concept highlighted in recent news as a result of reports of Vice President Mike Pence’s longstanding principle of not having meals alone with a woman or attending events serving alcohol unless accompanied by his wife.  The rule, famously articulated by the evangelical minister Billy Graham, is basically a guideline that says men and women should not meet alone, whether in offices, or cars, or other places in order to avoid illicit temptations or appearances of impropriety. It’s been adopted by other evangelical pastors and leaders (a history of its origin is here): The late founder of the evangelical university where I work was known for saying that he’d pass by a female member of his church walking in the rain if he were alone in his car to avoid the appearance of impropriety.       Related    Some congressmen won’t be alone with women staffers. They don’t know how damaging that is.  Once I realized why my colleague had turned down my offer, I felt a twinge of embarrassment and awkwardness, as though I’d invited him to a game of strip poker instead of a   ride to the other end of campus. Besides, I thought in an imaginary retort, “I’m just not that into you. ”    But the good part of this story is that despite working for nearly two decades at an evangelical university, I’ve had only two or three such encounters with the Billy Graham rule. While I have tremendous respect for men who place their marriages before their work, such a rule befits the world of Mad Men more than the   work world where women are to be treated as equals. But even more importantly, good character is even more trustworthy than the most   rules.    Virtue ethics is better than the Billy Graham rule. Virtue ethics relies on moral character that is developed through good habits rather than rules or consequences for the governing of behavior. Aristotle defined virtue as the mean between two extremes, one of excess and one of deficiency. It is a habit of moral character, which, because it is a habit, becomes a kind of second nature. As Aristotle explained, it does not depend upon rules.     Despite decades of working at evangelical institutions, I haven’t encountered the Billy Graham rule all that often Although I had grown up evangelical, I had never heard of the Billy Graham rule until well into my 30 years of professional life, most of it   and  . I’ve spent a lot of time around a lot of men in educational, political, and church contexts, some of that time one on one: discussing a book proposal over lunch, talking politics over coffee, traveling overseas to meet with foreign leaders, and having many   meetings with male colleagues, male bosses, male students, and men under my supervision.  In fact, my first secretary was a man. I was an administrator in a   school, and we spent a lot of time in close proximity, our two desks jammed into an office that had been built to hold just one person. Our little office was a busy place where a steady stream of students, parents, and teachers, flowed throughout most of each day. Still, we spent a lot of time alone together, man and woman, each of us married to other people. Somehow we managed to do our jobs without having an affair, falling in love, or (speaking for myself, at least) feeling one passing moment that even closely resembled lust.  And yet as soon as I type these words, I am checked by a sense of undue pride in my own   remembering that it is exactly such that goes before a fall.    While most Vox readers are at least passingly familiar with Billy Graham (and now his “rule”) many may not know about his grandson, Tullian Tchividjian, once a Presbyterian minister like his grandfather, but now disgraced after a series of extramarital affairs involving women under his ministerial care. The distance between the rule and its fall is, apparently, just one generation  —   and perhaps one dose of a sense of invincibility.  The real tool for avoiding workplace romance: the virtue of prudence Of course, one need not look far to find myriad examples of such failures and betrayals. If these don’t give us pause, then we are imprudent indeed. Prudence, in fact, is what seems to be missing from the conversation about the vice president’s “rules. ” And I don’t mean prudence in the way that some supporters of the Billy Graham rule are using the term. Prudence as properly understood is a virtue, not a rule.  It is the virtue most applicable in the context of guarding against workplace romances, the habit of making right decisions. Prudence, which literally means foresight, is the mean between cunning and negligence. It is wisdom in action. While prudence does not rely on rules, it doesn’t shun them either. Failure to acknowledge this would be as foolish as praising the federal Title IX regulations out of one side of the mouth while mocking Pence’s personal protections against sexual misbehavior out of the other. I would be unable to serve half of my students if I had a rule not to meet with a man alone, and the same would be true of my male colleagues and their students. On the other hand, because of this necessity, my school (like most) has windows on all office doors and a rule that those windows are not to be covered. This is prudent. The lack of any guiding principles is a deficiency, specifically the vice of negligence. The opposite vice, the excess of prudence, is cunning. Cunning in this context manifests itself in a particular way. Cunning foresees too much of sex too much of the time. It anticipates and plans excessively. As many critics have pointed out, excessive attempts to avoid potentially sexualized situations only sexualizes them further. Like my offer of a ride to my colleague: It wasn’t sexual  —   until it was.  While boundaries are not only good but necessary, they will shift from time to time, person to person, and situation to situation. After all, rules about no closed doors, lunches, or car rides were made many years before the internet became the most ubiquitous form of infidelity. Only moral character can guard against some things. Rigid,    all rules tend toward the excess of cunning, which is a vice.    In all things, moderation It’s interesting, but no great wonder, really, that we elected to our highest office, together, a   sexual predator and a sort of Pollyanna purist. As Charles Dickens once said of another revolution (not the sexual one) “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ” In other words, it was, and is now, an age of immoderation. We humans are creatures prone to immoderation. This is why virtue ethics is so crucial to human flourishing. The proper response to excess isn’t excess in the opposite direction (both of which are vices)  —   it’s virtue. If Pence’s guardedness toward his marriage and his heart seems excessive, the response to it ought not to be excessive. For example, it’s not rape culture, as one writer proclaims, to live a life that acknowledges the fact that people are sexual and that sexual attraction is heightened in some circumstances more than others, and to guard against that reality. On the other hand, there are a lot more reasons in my workplace for me to meet alone with a man than to plan my spouse’s surprise party or a funeral, as one public figure tweeted in response to the controversy. It is prudent, too, not to get too bent out of shape over one man’s   efforts to guard his marriage wisely. If our shared goal is equality for women in the workplace and protection of marriages and families, we cultivate the virtues in ourselves  —   and model them for others who are struggling to do so along with us  —   for the good of all. In all things, moderation  —   even in our responses to those we wish were more moderate.

"Former Va. Tech students indicted in killing of Blacksburg middle schooler.  A grand jury indicted two former Virginia Tech students on   murder and other charges Tuesday in the   killing of    Blacksburg resident Nicole Lovell, a prosecutor said. The Montgomery County, Va. grand jury returned the indictments against David Eisenhauer of Columbia, Md. and Natalie Keepers of Laurel, Md. both 19, after hearing a little more than an hour of testimony about the January slaying. Authorities allege that Eisenhauer and Keepers hatched a plan to kill Lovell and that Eisenhauer lured Lovell from her Blacksburg home on a cold January night and stabbed her in a wooded area. Prosecutors allege that Eisenhauer and Keepers then dumped Lovell’s body.  [Va. Tech freshman charged with killing Nicole Lovell]  Authorities have not disclosed a motive in the case, but two law enforcement officials previously told The Washington Post that Eisenhauer had an inappropriate relationship with Lovell. A friend said Lovell had hoped to run away with Eisenhauer and start a family. Lovell’s disappearance on Jan. 27 prompted a major search and generated headlines across the nation. Her body was discovered Jan. 30 in an area not far from the   Carolina border. Prosecutors have said the freshmen engineering majors carefully plotted details of Lovell’s killing over the course of January, even discussing it at a local restaurant. Authorities said Lovell and Eisenhauer met online, and a neighbor told the New York Times that Lovell showed her messages on the app Kik and said she was sneaking out that night to meet someone named David.  After Lovell vanished, prosecutors said detectives combed through her social media accounts, where Lovell had sought solace from bullying at her Blacksburg middle school. They discovered that Lovell had exchanged messages with Eisenhauer around 12:40 a. m. on the day she disappeared. When confronted by authorities, Eisenhauer initially denied killing Lovell, but he later admitted his role in her slaying. Prosecutors said Keepers’s role in killing Lovell was particularly chilling because she did not know the girl. At an earlier court hearing, one said Keepers was “excited to be part of something secretive. ”  [Keepers was ‘excited to be part of something secretive’]  Eisenhauer was a standout runner in high school, and Keepers had dreams of working for NASA. They had become close friends at Virginia Tech. The grand jury indicted Eisenhauer on counts of abduction and   murder in Lovell’s killing and added a charge of concealing a body. Keepers was indicted on charges of being an accessory to   murder before and after the fact, as well as improperly disposing of a body. Their trial dates were set for next March.  An attorney for Eisenhauer did not immediately return a call for comment. Keepers’s attorney declined to comment. Both could face up to life in prison if convicted on all charges. Both are being held without bond.  ",-0.5
"Mitch McConnell says the legislative filibuster is safe. Should we trust him?.  Last week, Republicans in the Senate invoked the   “nuclear option,” which immediately allowed President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, to be confirmed with a simple majority of the votes, rather than the previous   threshold. But what about the   impact of the rule change?    As Vox’s Jeff Stein noted, that senators have used such apocalyptic rhetoric to describe this rule change shows how important institutional procedure is to many of them. “This is a body blow to the institution,” Sen. John McCain ( ) told reporters on Wednesday. “I think we’re on a slippery slope. ” (And yet McCain was one of the 52 Republican senators to cast a   vote in favor of the change.)  On this episode of The Weeds, Matt Yglesias and Sarah Kliff are joined by Vox policy and politics editor Jim Tankersley to discuss the implications of the rule change and whether it could signal further changes in Senate procedure. They also touch on the looming battle over tax reform and a new white paper in the American Economic Review about the impact of gender quotas in Swedish government.

Also, be sure to get tickets for the Weeds live taping on April 18, and join the new official Facebook group for Weeds fans  —   those who join the group have the opportunity to win two tickets to the live taping.     Here’s Sarah on what invoking the nuclear option for Supreme Court nominees might signal about further rule changes:  One of the things I’m curious about is how much of [the opposition to changing the legislative filibuster] is influenced by the current legislative context, and if there will be a willingness to revisit this six months or a year down the road. Right now I think [Matt is] right  —   it really advantages the Senate to blame health care on rules, because they don’t actually want to get behind the thing that the House might pass. And they really like being able to say, “Well, with 50 votes, we can only deal with budgetary things. Sorry, guys, it’s our weird Senate rules. They’re just what they are. ” And it’s a great crutch to not be the ones who get blamed for millions of people losing insurance. The thing I wonder about is if you do get to the point where they have a bill that they actually like  —   I don’t know if it’s tax reform, or infrastructure, or something else that they actually really are enthusiastic [about] and really do want to move it through. I think now that they’re inching in this direction, it’s a lot easier to see McConnell going back on his remarks.  It’s hard for me to see it as a   commitment given the change we’ve seen to Senate rules over the past decade or so. I could very easily see Mitch McConnell, someone who wants to get his members elected, saying that “Democrats are being obstructionists on an important bill. We need to pass it,” and getting rid of [the filibuster] at some point in the future. Maybe it’s only with certain types of legislation, like it happened with nominations, as you inch further and further in that direction. It’s really hard to see how the filibuster continues to be compatible with the deep polarization we have right now.

"Tesla's Autopilot Fight, Uber's Bikes, and More Car News This Week. This week, we learned the future of the car is not owning one—at least not if Uber gets its way. The ride-hailing giant came out with twin announcements: On Monday, it said it would acquire the bike-share company Jump, in a deal worth $200 million. On Wednesday, it announced a move into car-sharing and public transit ticketing, too, inking deals with the startup Getaround and the British mobile payments company Masabi. The goal: Making it much, much easier to live car-free, and maybe take a few UberX rides along the way. Meanwhile, Airstream rolled out an adorable and very practical new trailer that is, perhaps, too small to share with too many honies, and the Silicon Valley–based lidar startup Luminar shared its newest tech with transportation editor Alex Davies. The National Transportation Safety Board has officially removed Tesla from its investigation into a fatal Autopilot crash, alleging the carmaker violated an agreement with the government panel by releasing data on the incident. Tesla, because it’s Tesla, hit back: “It's been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they're more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety,” it said in a statement. Senior writer Jack Stewart puts the fight in context—this is not the first NTSB v. Tesla showdown, and it's about way more than sharing data. Uber acquires the bike-sharing company Jump Bikes. The company isn’t new—it’s been around and running programs in cities since 2011—but its newer, sleeker, electric-pedal-assist bicycle threatened ride-hail’s shorter trips by offering a faster, cheaper alternative. One $200 million purchase later, Uber has neutralized the threat. If you can't beat 'em, buy 'em. Bikes are just the beginning: Uber announced Wednesday it’s getting into even more forms of mobility, by allowing San Francisco users to rent cars through its app, and eventually helping customers across the globe buy public transit tickets there, too. I write that it’s all part of a grand pivot. Now that the company sees it won’t own the ride-hailing business, it might as well make it easier for urbanites to get rid of their personal cars and keep them in its app as much as possible. Jack had the tough job this week of checking out Airstream’s new Nest, its smaller, petite-r, impeccably designed, $45,900 trailer. Compared to the $139,900 Classic, it's a steal! Jack spilt the tea (and then didn’t spill the tea) while testing out Clearmotion’s fancy new suspension, which smooths the ride over rough potholes. Why fix crumbling roads when you can turn your car into the equivalent of a hovercraft? Defense contractor Raytheon rolls out new low-power radar tech that could help officials track low-flying drones—and, as contributing writer Eric Adams points out, flying cars. Alex gets the lowdown on startup Luminar’s newest lidar, an extra-powerful sensor that can “see” farther, for cheaper, and is now rolling into serious production. I tackle why self-driving cars will never be “finished”. Like most software-enabled products, they’ll be updated constantly, and perfection will elude them. Porsche lets its engineers ignore all the rules that make cars legal for driving on the street, or even the race track, and the result is the 919 Evo—a hybrid that beat Lewis Hamilton's Formula 1 record at Belgium's famed Spa-Francorchamps racetrack. Jack breaks down the engineering of this new wonderbeast. This week was an Uber-palooza! It unveiled a new version of its driver app, with added transparency and a touch of gamification. Will the update totally heal the ride-hail company’s fraught relationship with drivers? Maybe not. The company also rolled out a slew of new safety features, including more frequent driver background checks and a way for riders to call 911 from within the app. In Seattle, the city council resolved to consider raising Uber and Lyft fares to ensure drivers are paid more. In Philadelphia, a district court judge ruled that UberBLACK drivers are independent contractors and not Uber employees. He wrote that he was the first federal judge to rule on the issue of ride-hailing apps and labor classification. East Asian ride-hail company Grab’s CEO does that Tusken Raider thing where they lift their spears and hoot in victory re: Uber’s exit from the region. Tesla plans to start production on the Model Y, a smaller, more affordable crossover, in November 2019. Because everyone knows the best time to start a new project is when you're desperately behind on whatever you're doing at the moment. The Volkswagen board, frustrated with the pace of change at the German carmaker, ousted CEO Matthias Müller in favor of Herbert Diess, who previously headed up the VW brand. Diess is known for his aggressive restructuring tactics; he has long been called “Mr. Cost Killer.” Fiat Chrysler, accused of illegally using software to game emissions standards on more than 100,000 American diesel vehicles, is close to a settlement with the Department of Justice and the California Air Resources Board. Because I know you were waiting for it: Here’s the transportation angle on Monday’s FBI raid of Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. ",0.0
"How social media is destroying the lives of teen girls. Slut pages. Sink shots. Yik Yak. Finstas. Kik. Snapchat. Revenge porn. Tinder food stamps. If that reads like a different language, chances are you’re not an American teenager on social media. It’s this world  —   a chaotic mix of nude photos,   and dysfunctional relationships  —   that author Nancy Jo Sales ventured into when researching her new book, “ ” (Knopf). Sales has been studying the lives of American teenagers since the 1990s. During her 2½ years of research for “American Girls,” she was alarmed, though not shocked, by what she found. (Most adult readers will be shocked, as Sales points out, by how wildly the adult experience of social media differs from that of a teen. An adult might be on Facebook and Twitter, but they probably haven’t even heard of most of the apps that teens use, let alone how they use them.) “What’s being expressed on social media has been percolating in our culture for decades,” Sales tells The Post. “But I was really troubled by the sexual harassment of teenage girls. It’s something that happens online on a daily basis  —   sometimes an hourly basis. And it’s so common, it’s become a regular part of teen culture. You’ll read an article about ‘sexting rings’ but what these articles miss is that it’s not at just one school. It’s happening at every school I researched. It’s become so common. ” “For most American girls, social media is where they live. ” Other aspects of teen culture Sales discusses in the book: slut pages, where nude photos of a girl, originally sent to one boy, are distributed to others  —   i. e. a sexting ring  —   and then posted on Instagram accounts like “[Name of School] Hotties” or “[Name of Town] Hos” for everyone to view and comment on, often dismissively. This is typically followed by a kind of schoolwide shaming (of the girl  —   never the boy) that calls to mind the tarring and feathering of Puritan New England, as was with a case from Boca Raton, Fla. which Sales details in the book. Recounts    Julie: “[My sister’s friend] was having a hard time, she was acting out. She’s a senior in high school and she was caught giving head to a boy  —   it was at a party and somebody walked in and took a picture and it went all over social media. And so many people were hating on her in the school and she literally had no friends left except my sister. She was being called a slut and it got to her really badly, cause she suffers from anxiety and depression, and she wanted to kill herself. ” A finsta: A fake Instagram account created under a different name, so that parents won’t know what their teens are up to online. “Especially if it’s like   girls posting pictures in their bras. Or like they use them to talk crap about each other,” clarifies    Kayla from Boca Raton in the book. Tinder food stamps: Using the dating app to exchange sex for free meals and other items, a sort of soft prostitution that has become normalized by social media. “Some sugar babies have Amazon Wish Lists where they tell their sugar daddies what they would like to have,” Sales writes. “Everything from jewelry to silverware to furniture to magazine subscriptions. ”   A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on  The sink shot: When a girl takes a selfie in a bathroom mirror, often in a thong, and poses with her behind propped against the sink, so that it will appear larger. Not surprisingly, Kim Kardashian popularized this sort of shot, also known as a “belfie,” or butt selfie. Revenge porn: When a couple breaks up and the boy passes around nude photos the girl sent him in confidence. Yik Yak and Kik: just two of the seemingly countless anonymous messaging apps that allow users to communicate with each other. Kik was the app cited in the January   in Blacksburg, Va. The day before she died, Nicole showed neighbors Kik messages she had exchanged with an    boy she was to meet that night. Two Virginia Tech freshmen are currently  . What Sales makes clear is just how prevalent social media is in the life of an American teenager. It’s not an occasional hobby, and most of the teens Sales spoke to told of how they were “addicted,” “obsessed” and “couldn’t stop” looking at their phones. “For most American girls, social media is where they live,” writes Sales, who spoke to over 200 girls ages   from Manhattan to Florida, Arizona, Texas and Kentucky. “While young women might have a tougher time on social media, it’s up to parents of both genders to take an active role in talking to their teens about what’s going on. ” “We’re on it ” a    girl in Montclair, NJ, told the author. “It’s all we do. ” And while teenagers have certainly always had sex, experimented with drugs, bullied each other and gotten into trouble, Sales is concerned by the way that social media magnifies these existing tendencies and makes young women matter less  —   they have less agency, less inclination to speak up about the online behavior that has become so prevalent. “We’ve evolved to communicate face to face. Our communication occurs more with nonverbal cues, body language,” says Sales. “There are studies showing that kids now are less able to have a conversation and make eye contact. So how does this affect girls? Well, whenever you have a situation in which people are dehumanized, women and girls suffer more. We are already more objectified. It becomes easier [for boys] to see someone as a thing, rather than a person. ” Case in point: the widespread demands for nude photos, sometimes by a crush or boyfriend, but often just from a random guy at school. (“Snapchat me that p —  y if it’s cool” goes the refrain in the Yo Gotti song “Down in the DM [Direct Message]” wherein a man messages another man’s girlfriend requesting nudes after seeing a photo of her BMW on Instagram.) “They have conversations with boys who [ask for nudes] and they think, ‘Maybe this is how I have a relationship,’ ” Sales says. “And one of the girls told me that if you respond by saying, ‘How dare you?’ or get angry, they say you have no chill. ” As    Sophia explains to Sales in the book: “‘They judge you if you don’t send nudes like you’re a prude. But if you just laugh, then they’ll be aggravated, but they won’t do anything bad to you . . . [such as] start rumors. Pretend like you sent them a naked picture they got off the Internet and it’s not even you.’ ”) In a chapter called “Thirteen” (all of the book’s chapters are named for the age of the girls discussed therein) Sales describes Riley, Sophia and Victoria coming out of middle school at the end of the school day in Montclair. The girls are all crowded around Riley’s phone, which displays a screenshot of a Snapchat from a boy at school named Zach, asking her for nude photos. This, it turns out, had been happening almost daily after Riley’s   Danny, had spread a rumor that she had given him oral sex. The rumor was untrue, started by another girl who had told Danny that Riley was flirting online with other guys. The girl had clearly hoped to cause a breakup, and did  —   after which Danny took to social media. “He called me a slut,” Riley said, “and everyone thought I was a slut and everyone started to hate me about that on social media. Like on Ask. fm. ” Ask. fm is a popular    website and app where teens go, as a 2013   put it, “to escape the   accountability of Facebook. ” It allows anyone to post comments and questions to a user’s profile. “Want to know more about your best friend or your crush? Looking for good advice on how to handle life’s little challenges? Just want to ask an inspiring person you’ve never met on the other side of the world about their lives? Go for it! Others will ask you in return, about anything,” claims the official Ask. fm FAQ section. Unfortunately, it’s also become the perfect forum for   and harassment. The app has been linked with at least seven teen suicides, according to an   organization called No Bullying, including a    named Hannah Smith from Leicestershire, England, who was routinely taunted by anonymous commenters who said things like “every[one] will be happy if u died,” “drink bleach” and “go die. ” Hannah hanged herself in August 2013 after receiving vile messages from Internet trolls for months. However, it has been reported that Hannah possibly sent many of these messages to herself and that she engaged in    a phenomenon best described as the virtual equivalent of cutting. Her parents have since become vocal advocates for the regulation of anonymity online. Sales, who lives in the East Village, has a    daughter who helped focus her research for the book. “She clued me in to a lot of stuff that was happening,” Sales says. The experience of researching and writing the book impressed upon her the necessity of having a conversation with her daughter  —   not just one, but an ongoing conversation about what was happening on social media. “I never lost my sense of what it is to be a teenager, I’m not sure why,” Sales says. “Some of these things are painful. One thing that’s important to do as a parent is remember what it felt like and tap into that. They’re just coming of age, they’re experiencing these things for the first time. There needs to be a great deal of compassion when you try to put yourselves in their shoes. I try and think, ‘She’s telling me this story, and how would I feel if this were happening to me?’ So instead of coming at it from a point of judgment or alarm [as a parent] I try to get rid of the fear of what you’re hearing and just listen. “People keep saying, ‘What am I supposed to do, take away her phone?’ No, that’s not what I’m saying in the book. Talk to [teens] about what they do on their phones and how much they’re on them. “It’s a challenging landscape, much of it unprecedented in our experience. And I feel we all have a responsibility to guide our daughters and sons through it. ” While young women might have a tougher time on social media, it’s up to parents of both genders to take an active role in talking to their teens about what’s going on. While some teens have stepped out of the social media loop altogether  —      Instagram star Essena O’Neill made headlines in the fall by quitting the app, saying, “social media is not real”  —   most don’t. “I spoke to girls who said, ‘social media is destroying our lives,’ ” Sales says. “ ‘But we can’t go off it, because then we’d have no life.’ There’s this whole perception that [teenage girls] love social media, but in many ways they hate it. But they don’t stop, because that’s where teen culture is happening. ”",1.0
"Ron Howard talks branded entertainment at Cannes Lions. Imagine Entertainment founder Ron Howard was in Cannes on Friday to advance a plan with marketers to create branded entertainment. He said investment company Raine Group, run by Joe Ravitch and Jeff Sine, had helped the firm broaden its business plan beyond making movies and TV series. “We have occasionally done some   business, but we haven’t done it as a business,” Howard said. Howard, of course, was just tapped to be director of the latest installment in the endless “Star Wars” franchise, the    Han Solo project. Sources told On the Money that Howard had a full slate of meetings in Cannes to get to know the advertising community and people who run successful Web businesses like Refinery29. Howard is currently working on Season 2 of “Mars” for National Geographic, chronicling NASA’s big push to reach the Red planet. “It was fueled by Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Yuri Milner,” he said. The NASA project got a lot of support from the Obama administration.",1.0
"Is it worth trying to ""reframe"" climate change? Probably not..  The danger of climate change does not arouse much public passion, certainly nothing like what the facts would warrant. This drives climate campaigners crazy. Always has.    So how to get people’s attention? One strategy might be to talk about climate change differently  —   to ”frame” it differently, in the current jargon. Over the years, climate scientists, campaigners, and policymakers have returned to this strategy (or, rather, this hope) again and again. And again. The alternate framings are familiar by now: global warming as an economic opportunity, a way to spur technological innovation, a national security threat, a way of reducing local pollutants, a religious or moral imperative.    These other ways of describing climate change are more visceral than     incremental risk (zzz  …    ). It seems like they ought to be more effective in getting people to pay attention and support action.    But are they? The research on framing effects has thus far been inconclusive, to say the least.             Testing frames, scientifically A letter published in Nature Climate Change in 2016 attempted to settle the question. Researchers Thomas Bernauer and Liam F. McGrath, political scientists at Switzerland’s Center for Comparative and International Studies, set up experiments in which people (drawn from different demographic and ideological backgrounds) were randomly assigned texts that framed climate change in different ways.    One was ”climate risk reduction,” the standard frame. The other three were ”economic   community building, and health benefits.” At the end, subjects were tested on three different measures of willingness to support action on climate change, ranging from personal action to policy action. Long story short: None of it worked. The researchers found that different framings had no consistent or statistically significant effects on subjects’ willingness to support climate action.    ”In summary,” Bernauer and McGrath write, ”we do not find any robust empirical evidence for alternative framing (justification) of climate policy being able to increase public support for GHG mitigation —  whether in the sample as a whole or amongst particular groups of participants (such as climate sceptics).”  So why don’t these frames seem to work? Magic words in politics In 2005, cognitive linguist George Lakoff released a book called Don’t Think of an Elephant! and became ”the father of framing,” as the New York Times put it. His ideas became extremely popular on the left, particularly during the    2000s heyday of the ”netroots.” Lakoff’s academic work is great  —   I read and loved one of his books back in school  —   but by the time framing reached the broad public, it had, shall we say, lost some of its rigor. Lots of people became convinced that words have a kind of magic power, that anyone can be convinced of anything given the right turn of phrase. Worse, a lot of people thought, ”Hey, I can do that!” And overnight, the internet was flooded with newly expert framers, including Lakoff himself, coming up with one ”elevator pitch for liberalism” after another.          George Lakoff. Not pictured: a frame.  All this mainly served to establish that knowing about framing does not make you good at framing. What people often forget is that changing the way an issue is framed, especially on any broad public scale, is incredibly difficult, for three reasons.    People’s lives and identities have great inertia Human beings are not freestanding reasoning machines. They are situated in the world, inheritors of particular socioeconomic conditions, worldviews, dispositions, and interpretive filters. They come complete with a strong set of overlapping, mutually reinforcing frames. To a great extent, those preexisting social and psychological commitments  —   which are outside the scope of any conceivable climate communication campaign  —   are going to determine how people assess a specific phenomenon like climate change. Bernauer and McGrath put it this way: ”[A] large amount of research shows that climate policy preferences are strongly shaped by factors that cannot be affected or offset through climate change communication per se (for example, political ideology, income, gender, general social norms, weather or climatic conditions, economic conditions of the respective country).” A lifetime of baggage carries a lot of weight and momentum. Comparatively, a single exposure to a bit of framing is nothing, like blowing on the sails of a giant ship. Or to switch metaphors: People exist within a matrix of   frames. Getting inside that matrix and tweaking just the climate change frame is no simple matter. It’s attached to other things.             The best that could be hoped for is to nudge people to a nearby framing, one that’s amenable to their priors, like getting conservatives already suspicious of government to think of inheritance taxes as ”death taxes.”    People seek out reinforcing frames Making things even more difficult, people’s preexisting dispositions and tribal ties largely determine what messages they will be exposed to in the first place. ”Existing research shows that people usually select information lining up with prior beliefs and attitudes,” Bernauer and McGrath write, ”to preserve their existing worldviews,   and   or to sustain beliefs that are in line with prevailing values, ideologies and beliefs in their social network.” It’s easy these days to live in an information bubble, to find nothing but confirmation of your priors everywhere you look. A bit of framing that’s contrary, or even just novel, is likely to be passed over by people mainly seeking identity reinforcement. Source and repetition matter more than cleverness Even if you can create a controlled environment in which everyone is exposed to your framing (and not other, contrary framings simultaneously) there’s still no guarantee it will stick. People often seem to think that clever wordsmithery is the key to good framing, but it’s not even really necessary. Two things make a message stick. First, it comes from a trusted source, which generally means someone within the tribe in question, however it is defined. If the audience is people who are generally hostile toward cultural elites, they’re probably not going to listen to a bespectacled Harvard scientist, even if he is framing things just so.    And second, messages stick when they are repeated. As conservative pollster Frank Luntz once famously said:  You say it again, and you say it again, and you say it again, and you say it again, and you say it again, and then again and again and again and again, and about the time that you’re absolutely sick of saying it is about the time that your target audience has heard it for the first time.  People are bombarded by messages all day long. It’s hard to break through.             Breaking through, reaching an audience, has little to do with cleverness and a lot to do with power, money, access to media, and a willingness on the part of messengers to exhibit heroic message discipline. It’s time to abandon the idea of wholesale climate reframing To sum up, the frames that reach people and actually make a difference are a) resonant with their existing dispositions and affiliations, b) delivered by a trusted source, and c) repeated often enough to penetrate the pervasive information buzz. That’s a heavy lift, to say the least. Changing the way global warming is framed in the popular imagination would require an enormous,     campaign, and there’s no guarantee it would work, even if the climate community could pull it off.    So maybe they should stick with the frame they’ve got. That’s what Bernauer and McGrath conclude. As they note, the ”time, money, political capital, and public attention” required for such a campaign ”are very much limited.” Spending them on a framing campaign, the effects of which are unclear to say the least, is an enormous risk. ”[O]n the basis of what we know so far,” they write, ”policymakers should keep a strong focus on climate risk reduction as the dominant justification” for action on climate change. That’s the frame ”into which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific community as a whole, and most governments and civil society have invested in very heavily over the past decades.” I’ve gone back and forth on this over the years, but I more or less agree. The one frame for climate change that’s broadly accepted, frequently repeated, and widely understood is that it’s dangerous and we should do what we can to avoid it.             That also turns out to be, objectively speaking, the most important reason to address climate change  —   the future of humanity and all that.    This isn’t to say that other frames can’t work for particular audiences at particular times. Entrepreneurs could be (and have been) taken by the notion that climate is an enormous business innovation opportunity. Conservatives could be (and have been) taken by the notion that renewable energy offers energy independence. Disadvantaged or polluted communities could be (and have been) taken by the notion that climate mitigation also mitigates   pollutants. And so on. ”Know your audience and speak to them in a way that resonates” is a fairly old bit of counsel, around long before cognitive linguistics, and it’s as true as ever. But in terms of any     concerted effort to change the way people think and talk about climate change? Meh. It’s the kind of thing that forever appeals to funders, but it’s a huge undertaking with dubious chances of success at a fairly late stage in the game. Climate change is what it is. The thing to do is just keep plugging away at it. ",-1.0
"The Neat Engineering VW Used to Smash the Pikes Peak Record. If you had any remaining doubts about the performance and power of electric cars, then you should spend eight minutes (ok, just under eight minutes) watching the Volkswagen ID R smash the Pikes Peak Hill Climb Record yesterday.

"J.J. Abrams loves mystery almost to a fault. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, he gets it exactly right..  Until recently, the existence of 10 Cloverfield Lane, produced by J. J. Abrams, was a closely guarded secret.    Like its predecessor, the 2008   monster movie Cloverfield, the movie was produced entirely without fanfare or   marketing. No plot details or character descriptions were leaked; there were no set photos, no interviews with stars, no advertisements or media of any kind. The release of 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn’t announced at all until the middle of January, in a surprise trailer attached to 13 Hours, barely two months before its debut.   Related Review: 10 Cloverfield Lane is a   thriller that’s worthy of the secrecy surrounding it   Viewers weren’t the only ones who didn’t know it was coming. Even the cast of 10 Cloverfield didn’t know they were making a   to Cloverfield. As David Ehrlich reported in Rolling Stone, star Mary Elizabeth Winstead learned the title of the film, and its relationship to the original, just an hour before the surprise trailer went online. There are secret government programs with a bigger public footprint than this movie had until the last couple of weeks before its debut. Secrecy has been a hallmark of Abrams’s work throughout his cinematic career. It’s been a marketing choice as well as a narrative choice, and we see both at play in 10 Cloverfield Lane, which doles out its revelations, big and small, with devastating skill and precision. It’s a movie that shows the cinematic power secrets can hold when they’re used effectively.     10 Cloverfield Lane smartly keeps both its characters and the audience guessing 10 Cloverfield Lane is built on secrets. Throughout most of the movie, which was directed by Dan Trachtenberg from a script by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stucken, and Damien Chazelle, viewers don’t really know what’s going on. And the way it keeps viewers in the dark is by keeping its characters in the dark  —   in particular, the protagonist, Michelle, played by Winstead.    When we first meet Michelle, she’s fleeing her apartment to escape a troubled relationship. The details are vague  —   something about an argument  —   but they don’t matter. We know enough, which is that she’s trying to get away and start life anew. But as she drives out of the city, she’s involved in a horrific wreck. And when she wakes up, she’s chained to the wall in an underground bunker, held against her will by an apparently disturbed man named Howard (John Goodman) who insists there’s been some sort of attack, that the air above ground isn’t safe. The movie generates suspense through Michelle’s uncertainty: She doesn’t know Howard, doesn’t know what, if anything, happened above ground. And Howard seems like a potentially dangerous crank: He carries a gun and a knife, is prone to violent outbursts, and speculates that Martians might be responsible for contaminating the atmosphere. A fellow resident of the bunker, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) attests to some of Howard’s basic story, but even he knows very little in the way of solid information.    Most of the movie, then, is a process of discovery  —   about Howard and who he really is, about Michelle and how she ended up in the bunker, and ultimately about what’s really happening in the outside world. It’s remarkably tense, a feeling that stems from the basic fact that Michelle  —   and by extension, the audience  —   doesn’t have any idea what’s going on. The movie is told entirely from her point of view, and even the camerawork, which hovers close to her face to show her feelings of confusion and pans widely around the cramped bunker space to let us see it as she does, often seems to mimic her vision and state of mind. We know only what she knows. Using secrets in this fashion doesn’t just create suspense. It draws us closer to the characters who are trying to figure them out, making us identify with them as we see the world through their eyes and creating a shared set of experiences. They become an extension of the viewer.    The way mysteries are handled can make or break a film 10 Cloverfield Lane saves its biggest surprises for last. I don’t want to spoil anything, but I’ll just say this: You really don’t know what you’re getting into, and you don’t want to know. In a way, then, the movie’s marketing mirrors the structure of the movie itself, withholding crucial information in order to build suspense and excitement. That’s par for the course for Abrams, who tends to build mystery and deception into the marketing for a lot of his work: The television show Lost, which he helped create, was an extended tease about a mysterious island. The original Cloverfield (which, like this one, Abrams produced but didn’t direct) was announced with a trailer that didn’t even reveal the movie’s name and only vaguely hinted at the giant monster the film would eventually unveil. The   Star Trek Into Darkness withheld the name of its main villain, Khan, a callback to the antagonist from   Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, giving him the fake name of John Harrison in promotional material. His Mission: Impossible III relied on a mystery MacGuffin  —   the ”rabbit’s foot”  —   whose true nature was never revealed at all. These mystery maneuvers are part of what define Abrams as a filmmaker and cinematic impresario, but they don’t always work. In some cases, as with Cloverfield, they’re just marketing gimmickry, designed to generate attention through surprise. In other cases, as with M:I —  3, they’re essentially a narrative shortcut  —   a way of suggesting the possibility of something truly revolutionary without ever having to explain what it is. Many of Lost’s big mysteries worked this way too, engaging and enraging viewers by refusing to make clear what was actually going on. And in still other cases, as with Star Trek Into Darkness, it’s a bit of both  —   a way of teasing fans (many of whom suspected that Khan might play a role in the film) and referencing a beloved franchise character without doing the work of truly developing him as a character. (Abrams has since expressed regret for Into Darkness’s handling of Khan.) But the mystery works in 10 Cloverfield Lane because it’s built into the story, growing organically out of the characters’ experience and creating a connection between the protagonist and the audience.    That connection is strong enough that when things go truly nuts at the end, you’re already bought in. You accept what you’re seeing, because Michelle does. The mystery isn’t designed to frustrate viewers, or to cheat them, or to tease them with possibilities that are never paid off, but rather to draw them more deeply into the film’s world. And that’s the real secret to using this sort of cinematic trickery and deception: The mystery is only as good as the story it tells. ",-1.0
"Colombia: 193 dead after rivers overflow, toppling homes.  BOGOTA, Colombia  —   An avalanche of water from three overflowing rivers swept through a small city in Colombia while people slept, destroying homes, sweeping away cars and killing at least 193 unsuspecting residents. The incident triggered by intense rains happened around midnight in Mocoa, a provincial capital of about 40, 000 tucked between mountains near Colombia’s southern border with Ecuador. Muddy water and debris quickly surged through the city’s streets, toppling homes, ripping trees from their roots and carrying them downstream. Many of the residents did not have enough time to climb on top of their roofs or seek refuge on higher ground. According to the Red Cross, 400 people were injured and 220 believed missing. President Juan Manuel Santos declared a state of emergency on Saturday and said the death toll will likely rise but warned against speculating how many people are dead.  “We don’t know how many there are going to be,” he said of the fatalities when he arrived at the disaster zone to oversee rescue efforts. “We’re still looking. ”        Eduardo Vargas, 29, was asleep with his wife and    baby when he was awoken by the sound of neighbors banging on his door. He quickly grabbed his family and fled up a small mountain amid the cries of people in panic.  “There was no time for anything,” he said. Vargas and his family huddled with about two dozen other residents as rocks, trees and wooden planks ripped through their neighborhood below. They waited there until daylight, when members of the military helped them down. When he reached the site of his home Saturday, he found nothing but rocks and mud.  “Thank God we have our lives,” he said. As rescuers assessed the full scope of the damage, many residents in Moncoa continued a desperate search for friends and relatives. Oscar Londono tried in vain throughout the night to reach his wife’s parents, whose home is right along one of the flooded rivers. He decided it was too dangerous to try to reach them in the dark. So he called over and over by phone but got no answer. Once the sun began to rise he started walking toward their house but found all the streets he usually takes missing. As he tried to orient himself he came across the body of a young woman dressed in a   and black blouse. He checked her pulse but could not find one.  “There were bodies all over,” he said. When he finally reached the neighborhood where his   live he found “just mud and rocks. ” Rescue workers with the military oriented him toward the mountain, where he found his relatives camped with other survivors.  “To know they were alive,” he said, “it was a reunion of tears. ” Santos said at least 22 people were seriously injured and being airlifted to nearby cities, as the small regional hospital in Mocoa struggled to cope with the magnitude of the crisis. Herman Granados, an anesthesiologist, said he worked throughout the night on victims, cleaning wounds. He said the hospital doesn’t have a blood bank large enough to deal with the number of patients and was quickly running out of its supply. Some of the hospital workers came to help even while there are own relatives remained missing.  “Under the mud,” Granados said, “I am sure there are many more. ” The Red Cross planned to set up a special unit in Mocoa Saturday afternoon to help relatives search for their loved ones.  “In this moment, it’s chaos,” said Oscar Forero, a spokesman with the Colombian Red Cross. “There are many people missing. ” Santos blamed climate change for triggering the avalanche, saying that the accumulated rainfall in one night was almost half the amount Mocoa normally receives in the entire month of March. With the rainy season in much of Colombia just beginning, he said local and national authorities need to redouble their efforts to prevent a similar tragedy. ___ This story corrects the population of Mocoa to 40, 000.

"Sweden’s deputy prime minister trolled Trump with a feminist photo op.  A photo of President Donald Trump in the Oval Office signing a series of executive orders  —   including one that would dramatically restrict women’s access to health care around the world  —   surrounded by nothing but white men sparked anger and ridicule on social media last week, with many pointing out the irony of the situation:      As long as you live you’ll never see a photograph of 7 women signing legislation about what men can do with their reproductive organs pic. twitter.  —   Martin Belam (@MartinBelam) January 23, 2017      If you’re wondering what patriarchy looks like: A group of white men watch as Trump reinstates the #GlobalGagRule pic. twitter.  —   Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 23, 2017      “We’ve got your best interests at heart, ladies. Believe me. ” pic. twitter.  —   Greg Greene (@ggreeneva) January 23, 2017    On Friday, Sweden’s deputy prime minister and climate minister, Isabella Lövin, tweeted out her own staged   photo  —   and the photo composition looks strangely familiar.  In the photo, Lövin sits at a desk in the far left of the frame and, pen in hand poised over a document, stares right into the camera as seven women colleagues with decidedly confrontational body language and facial expressions look on in support.    Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045. For a safer and better future. pic. twitter.  —   Isabella Lövin (@IsabellaLovin) February 3, 2017    And although the legislation Lövin was signing was related to climate change and not specifically women’s issues, it’s a powerful  —   and rather hilarious  —   photograph clearly meant to send a pointed,   message to Donald Trump: “Come at us, bro. ”    The substance of the legislation is similarly pointed. Speaking to the Swedish media outlet the Local, Lövin said, ”There is a global demand for climate leadership. I want to show that Sweden is ready to take that leadership. The new climate law that was announced yesterday marks a new era in Swedish climate politics. ” Donald Trump once famously tweeted, “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing  ” and repeatedly vowed on the campaign trail that he would “cancel” the Paris climate agreement once in office.  Lövin’s photo op wasn’t just a   but rather is emblematic of Sweden’s governing philosophy. ”We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo,” Lövin told the Local. And she’s not joking. Sweden is literally a feminist government  —   it’s a formal policy that’s stated right on the Government of Sweden’s official website:     Sweden has the first feminist government in the world. This means that gender equality is central to the Government’s priorities  —   in   and resource allocation. A feminist government ensures that a gender equality perspective is brought into   on a broad front, both nationally and internationally. Women and men must have the same power to shape society and their own lives. This is a human right and a matter of democracy and justice. Gender equality is also part of the solution to society’s challenges and a matter of course in a modern welfare state  —   for justice and economic development. The Government’s most important tool for implementing feminist policy is gender mainstreaming, of which   budgeting is an important component. But Lövin, clearly a canny politician with more than a little talent for the art of diplomatic dissembling, refrained from stating outright right that the photo was meant as a direct parody of the Trump signing photos. “Ultimately,” she told the Local, “it is up to the observer to interpret the photo. ” ",-1.0
"1 in 3 Americans Suffered Severe Online Harassment in 2018. Despite concerted efforts by tech giants to cut back on abhorrent behavior on their platforms, a new survey finds that severe forms of online hate and harassment, including stalking and physical threats, may be on the rise. According to the survey, released Wednesday by the Anti-Defamation League, more than one third of Americans reported experiencing some type of severe online hate or harassment in 2018. A similar Pew Research Center report found that 18 percent of Americans said they were targeted with severe online harassment in 2017. For young people, the numbers are even worse, with about half of 18- to 29-year-olds saying they experienced some kind of severe harassment online in 2018. The survey, which was conducted in December by the public opinion research firm YouGov, paints a bleak picture of what millions of Americans go through when they log online. At a time when Facebook is touting the use of automation to detect harassment, Twitter has vowed to make conversation on the site “healthier,” and YouTube is cracking down on toxic videos, it suggests that these efforts are no match for an increasingly ugly and tribal digital landscape. “Online harassment is not a tiny thing that happens to a small number of people, but is actually something that’s happening to a lot of people.” ",0.0
"In Trump, Tech Finds a Troll It Can't Ignore. To adapt one of our new president's favorite aphorisms: We knew he was a troll when we elected him. Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump gleefully behaved more like a social-network scourge than a presidential candidate, combining a slash-and-burn approach to social norms with an aggressive strategy of constant provocation. So it's perhaps not surprising that, in the not-quite-two-weeks since his inauguration, internet companies have struggled to respond to his presidency. After all, they're not very good at dealing with trolls. Like internet trolls, Trump poses an impossible question: How do you respond when a process that you respect—in this case, American democracy—produces a result that you cannot? The problem offers no easy way out. Democrats struggle with whether to take Trump's nominees seriously on a case-by-case basis, or reject them outright. The press wrestles with how to cover an administration in ""open warfare"" against them. Working within the accepted rules of the system might empower a threat to the system itself. But rejecting Trump shows contempt for the people who voted for him, and the system that produced him. ",0.0
"Everyone’s wifi is terrible — even President Obama’s.  In his final year at the White House, President Barack Obama is on a mission   …     to fix the White House’s wifi.    Yup, the White House, the home and workplace of the leader of the free world, has a bad wifi connection. ”This is an old building, so there are a lot of dead spots where the wifi doesn’t work,” Obama said on CBS in a joint interview with Michelle Obama about their Sunday Super Bowl plans. The spotty connection is on his list of things to fix for the next president.    ”The whole tech thing, we’ve been trying to get that straight for the next group of folks,” Obama said. Obama has been a notable   of some TV shows like House of Cards, Homeland, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones. The spotty wifi sounds like it makes streaming TV shows an irritation for the whole family. ”It can be a little sketchy,” Michelle said. ”The girls are just irritated by it.”     ",-1.0
"Artificial Intelligence May Not 'Hallucinate' After All. Thanks to advances in machine learning, computers have gotten really good at identifying what’s in photographs. They started beating humans at the task years ago, and can now even generate fake images that look eerily real. While the technology has come a long way, it’s still not entirely foolproof. In particular, researchers have found that image detection algorithms remain susceptible to a class of problems called adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are like optical (or audio) illusions for AI. By altering a handful of pixels, a computer scientist can fool a machine learning classifier into thinking, say, a picture of a rifle is actually one of a helicopter. But to you or me, the image still would look like a gun—it almost seems like the algorithm is hallucinating. As image recognition technology is used in more places, adversarial examples may present a troubling security risk. Experts have shown they can be used to do things like cause a self-driving car to ignore a stop sign, or make a facial recognition system falsely identify someone. ",0.0
"Even after Trump loses, the GOP is still toast.       Last year, I wrote  an article calling Donald Trump a godsend for moderate Republicans. Trump, I predicted, would lose so spectacularly that the GOP would be forced to transform itself, surrendering its mindless obstructionism, science denial, xenophobia and plutocracy. After a purge like that, the party would finally be able to compete in future national elections. I was wrong. I now see that Trump’s candidacy has exacerbated the Republican Party’s weaknesses, alienating minorities, fracturing the base and stunting smart policy development. The party’s structural problems are so severe that reform is impossible. Even if Trump loses and the GOP races to forget him, the party is doomed. And very few of our leaders seem to care.  In the short run, it will be easy for Republicans to convince themselves that nothing needs to change. The establishment believes that Trump is an anomaly, an aberration. GOP leaders think the party’s next nominee will be a more typical politician who knows the issues, has   debating skills and who will appeal to the elite and the Trumpkins. Someone like John Kasich or Marco Rubio. Many leaders also assume that Hillary Clinton is an automatic  . They think she’s incompetent,   and   on destroying the economy. They know, too, that neither party has held the White House for more than three terms in the   War II era. But Clinton’s chances of being reelected in 2020 are better than Republicans think. Already, Democrats have a virtual lock on 18 states, giving them an almost automatic 242 electoral votes. States such as Virginia, Colorado and Florida routinely vote Democratic, too. Additionally, the Republican Party will have to contend with the Trump constituency, which will remain a powerful force in the presidential primaries (fueled, perhaps, by a Trump cable channel). White nationalists will continue to back racist candidates, alienating minority voters. It’s not hard to imagine another cycle with 17 candidates vying for the nomination. If that comes to pass, someone could win the primary race with less than half the vote, as Trump did. It could well be a candidate unpopular with mainstream conservatives. Even if not, it’s hard to imagine Republicans unifying around a consensus candidate. If Clinton wins a second term, major progressive change becomes possible. Sixteen years of Democratic presidents will give the Supreme Court a solid liberal majority, making electoral reform doable. Restrictions on campaign contributions and gerrymandering could emerge, making it harder to draw districts that reliably swing one way or the other. If Democrats put resources into state legislative races, they may be able to undercut GOP gerrymandering after the 2020 census. The practice gives Republicans more seats than their share of the aggregate House vote  —   in 2014 they earned 51 percent of the vote but 57 percent of the seats.  By 2022, it’s possible that Democrats will control Congress and gridlock will be broken. Once that happens, the federal government will be able to tackle major issues. The constant Republican demands for budget cuts, tax cuts and deregulation won’t be the starting points for all policy discussion. We could see fundamental tax reform that raises rates for the rich and multinational corporations, meaningful measures to address climate change, fresh funding for crumbling infrastructure, and a public option for the Affordable Care Act. These measures, which I support, are popular with Americans. Their passage will bring more voters into the Democratic fold. These policies will, of course, be opposed by Republicans (even those who know better) because the GOP’s   party wing will control the nominating and primary process for years to come, dooming any leader or lawmaker who compromises with Democrats. At this point, corporations and lobbyists will have to work almost exclusively with the Democratic Party to have a seat at the policy table. Even the billionaires who now provide the oil that keeps the GOP machine lubricated may decide that if they can’t have tax cuts, they should try to carve out special breaks for themselves. To do so, they may start funding friendly Democratic candidates and campaigns. As former U. S. deputy Treasury secretary Roger Altman showed recently in the Financial Times, busi ness peo ple are already flocking to Clinton, and to Democrats more broadly. Deprived of funding and business support, the national GOP will shrivel to what the party has become in California  —   irrelevant politically and unable to win outside its wealthy,   enclaves. Republicans hold just 35 percent of the California Senate and Assembly, and have no hope of regaining the governor’s mansion or U. S. Senate seats. Virtually all debate about policy takes place among the Democratic Party’s strong factions. Everyone who matters is a Democrat. Eventually, of course, Democrats will become corrupt, will overreach or will bear the blame for things beyond their control, like a recession. They may foolishly nominate someone too far left for the country, giving a Republican another shot at the White House. A strong leader could change the GOP’s trajectory, like Dwight Eisenhower did after five straight Republican presidential losses from 1932 to 1948. He put the party, as conservative then as it is today (just read the 1952 platform) on a more moderate, technocratic path that continued for a   through Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. A leader like Eisenhower might help right the GOP, attracting moderate voters and enhancing the party’s crossover appeal.   When I began criticizing the GOP for pandering to populists and extremists, I was largely alone. But now, longtime Republican luminaries, including John McCain’s 2008 campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, and Washington Post columnist George Will, share my perspective. Many, such as Josh Barro, a columnist for Business Insider, have virtually washed their hands of the party, viewing the intellectual rot as terminal. Of course, the conservative era that lasted from 1994 to 2016 will leave behind legacies  —   some court decisions and legislative policies, such as aggressive tax cuts and a focus on deficit reduction, will be hard to reverse. But by and large, the right will cease being the obstacle to progress that it has been. Democrats will have to follow through with policy actions and political organizing at the state and local levels if they hope to see a   period in power. Still, the ground is being plowed and a brighter future  —   one without gridlock, when one major party can enact sweeping change  —   is visible on the horizon. Because of the way our government is set up, the United States will probably always have two parties. But it is not foreordained that the GOP will be the   party. It could go the way of the Whigs or Canada’s Conservative Party in 1993 and literally disappear, or it could reconstitute itself so radically that it bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of today. One thing, however, is certain: A party that cannot capture the White House cannot survive.  Twitter: @BruceBartlett   Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter. ",-0.5
"Four ways not to get screwed during Restaurant Week. Restaurant Week, which starts Monday and runs through Feb. 10, is rarely the deal it’s cracked up to be. By the time you order the   bottle of wine, the meal isn’t much, if at all, cheaper than an average night out. Worse, your menu choices are limited, sometimes excluding the very dishes the restaurant’s known for  —   and you’ve been stamped with the scarlet letters “RW” as soon as you sit down, which doesn’t make for the most hospitable treatment. That said, with careful picking, you’ll do well. Here are four good deals. This novel Soho restaurant has a menu full of dishes from acclaimed chefs and restaurants across the country, but sampling them doesn’t come cheap. The Restaurant Week menu allows you to create an eclectic meal. Start with the Ceviche Classic from Miami’s La Mar, follow it with   fried chicken (below) from Belles Hot Chicken in Australia and finish with   panna cotta from New York’s own Milk Bar.  Since opening last year, this   bistro has won raves for its rotisserie chicken, but it’s not cheap. A whole bird will set you back $100. For Restaurant Week, the restaurant is offering a quarter chicken, plus an appetizer and one of its excellent desserts, for $29.  Tom Colicchio’s Flatiron District classic has far more variety than most on its Restaurant Week menu. Choose among eight first courses, nine second courses and three desserts  —   including   cookies to go.  Time’s running out on this acclaimed but pricey Chinese restaurant at the Waldorf Astoria, which will close at the end of February with the rest of the hotel. The restaurant is known for its flavorful raw fish preparations: Try the fluke appetizer with Chinkiang vinegar and smoking peony oil. ",1.0
"Senate passes North Korea sanctions bill as nuclear worries grow.      The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed legislation that would impose mandatory sanctions on North Korea, in a bid aimed at forcing the international community to retaliate more strongly against the rogue nation after a series of worrisome moves. Since North Korea announced its fourth nuclear test in early January, it has launched a satellite into space over international objections, and a top U. S. intelligence official has warned that Pyongyang is perhaps only weeks from recovering plutonium from its restarted Yongbyun reactor. Yet none of these steps seem to have broken a logjam at the U. N. Security Council, where competing loyalties are keeping the United States, China, and other members from punishing North Korea, despite the shared sentiment that the rogue regime’s latest steps are out of line. “When we have ‘partners,’   on the U. N. Security Council that are unwilling to take steps, it means even more so that this body  …     has got to be proactive,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( .) said Wednesday. The United States has tried to direct its response to North Korea through the U. N. Security Council. Just two weeks ago, China, North Korea’s most important sponsor, agreed to back a resolution condemning North Korea’s recent nuclear test. But Beijing never took the additional step  —   supporting expanded sanctions against the rogue regime. Now Congress doesn’t want to wait for the Security Council to get its act together or for the Obama administration to act unilaterally. “This legislation represents what Congress needs to do,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Ben Cardin ( .) “U. S. leadership is absolutely critical in standing up to North Korea’s activities. ” The bill was passed on a 96 to 0 vote. The House passed similar legislation last month and may soon consider the Senate measure. It’s unclear if the White House supports the language, but they have not publicly objected to it. [Senate North Korea bill would force White House hand on sanctions] The two remaining Republican senators on the presidential campaign trail, Ted Cruz (Texas) and Marco Rubio (Florida) made sure to bolster their national security bona fides by returning to Washington to vote for the bill. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ( .) missed the vote. Cruz said the administration should go beyond sanctions to further pressure Pyongyang. “The president should list North Korea again as a state sponsor of terrorism,” he told reporters. “The president needs to pressure China to rein in North Korea and stop pretending China is a friend on this. ” The Senate bill is a compromise drafted by Sens. Cory Gardner ( .) and Robert Menendez ( . J.) and goes a few steps further than the House legislation. Most of the bill’s new sanctions on North Korea are mandatory, forcing the president to freeze the assets and impose travel bans on anyone engaging in trade or financial transactions that support the country’s nuclear, weapons, precious metals and raw materials industries, human rights abuses, and cyber threats. Such mandatory sanctions are a rare step for Congress, which usually authorizes sanctions but gives the administration discretion on when and upon whom to enforce them. Under the bill, the president would maintain the right to waive certain sanctions  —   but only on a    basis, and only if it is in the national security or   interest of the United States. The sanctions would provide exceptions for humanitarian organizations and aid workers seeking to help the North Korea people. Recently, Congress has become increasingly impatient with the administration’s lack of speed in imposing sanctions on regimes that break international rules. In the last few months, even Democrats voiced frustration with the administration’s response to Iran staging two ballistic missile tests, despite evidence that they violated existing U. N. Security Council resolutions. The administration eventually announced last month that it had added 11 people and entities to the Iran sanctions list over the tests, but lawmakers don’t believe that is enough. What Congress hopes to do with North Korea is in a sense, repeat history, by ramping up sanctions to such a crippling extent that they force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear ambitions and change course on human rights  —   or at least come to the negotiating table, as they did before. Senators of both parties recalled the   when the United States sanctioned   Banco Delta Asia, which was handling funds for the North Korean regime. Those sanctions eventually yielded a breakthrough in negotiations to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons. But the breakthrough didn’t last  —   the U. S. later eased sanctions as a bargaining chip, and talks eventually fell apart. “We let up, we didn’t keep the pressure up,” Cardin said Wednesday. “This legislation will correct that oversight. ” And both Democrats and Republicans identified another precursor to imposing tough sanctions on North Korea: Iran. If Congress can emulate the Iran sanctions in the case of North Korea, lawmakers reasoned, it might bring Pyongyang to the nuclear negotiating table, just as punishing sanctions eventually compelled Tehran to make a deal to surrender its nuclear ambitions for lifting sanctions. Even lawmakers that derided and voted against the Iran nuclear deal acknowledged it was an important precedent for North Korea sanctions policy  —   especially because the United States began sanctioning Iran long before the United Nations picked up the cause. “When we began the Iran sanctions, it was unilateral,” Corker argued, though he opposed the Iran nuclear deal. “I really do believe that passage today of this, and ultimate signature by the president, has the potential to unleash the same chain of events that occurred relative to Iran, hopefully with a better outcome. ” Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.",-0.5
"How women, even Hollywood actors, have to fight the Motherhood Penalty.      Hollywood actor mamas, they’re just like us. Well, maybe a little. Robin Wright, star of the Netflix series “House of Cards,” recently told the story of how she demanded to receive the same pay as   Kevin Spacey or she’d go public. Ends up she went public, but for a good reason: She’s getting paid what she deserves since issuing her demands. Like many women who are paid less than their male counterparts, she noted that she fell behind when she became a mother. According to a Huffington Post story: “The actor, who shot to stardom after playing Jenny in the iconic 1994 movie ‘Forrest Gump,’ said her career trajectory later fell off track after having children with   Sean Penn. Her two kids are now in their 20s. ‘Because I wasn’t working full time, I wasn’t building my salary bracket. If you don’t build that   …     with notoriety and presence, you’re not in the game anymore. You become a   actor. You’re not box office material,’ Wright said. ‘You don’t hold the value you would have held if you had done four movies a year like Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett did during the time I was raising my kids. Now I’m kind of on a comeback at 50 years old.’ ” What Wright is describing isn’t unique. It even has a name. It’s called the Motherhood Penalty. Just replace box office with corporate leadership position, executive or partner, and Wright is like many other working mothers who have a gap on their resume. “Women and men in the workforce who have kids see different things happen,” said Kevin Miller, senior researcher at the American Association of University Women (AAUW). “When you look at the overall data on salary over time, women who have kids end up taking a hit   …     whereas fatherhood earns a wage premium. Fathers earn more overtime. ” According to AAUW’s recent report “Barriers and Bias: The Status of Women in Leadership,” men see a 6 percent increase in earnings after they become a parent while new moms see a 4 percent decrease. Women are still being paid 79 percent of what men are. Do we, as the 79 percent clock meme suggests, go home after we complete 79 percent of our work? Of course not. But if women are treated like they aren’t equal or aren’t compensated properly, they will leave. Women, like Wright, are no longer willing to accept the penalty of being gone. Sure, Kevin Spacey kept working and earning while Wright was mostly gone from the scene. But so what? She’s a fantastic actress, they’re doing the same job now and so same pay is warranted. Women that companies want and need  —   women you want in charge  —   will leave if they aren’t compensated fairly. They may stick around for a bit because things are comfortable, stick with the devil you know, blah blah blah. But the first opportunity they get, the first chance they have for better or equal pay and acknowledgement, they will walk. And they have and they do. It’s called “taking time off. ” Those women who take time off rarely are off. They start their own businesses, do consulting or project work. They find placements through organizations such as Power to Fly and the new Apres Group. They report about their situation and read up on whom they want to work for with organizations such as Fairy God Boss, where you can rate your company or find a job at one that has a good rating. In other words, women will do what women (what mothers) do. They get creative and they find a way. Obviously, this isn’t possible for nearly enough women. People like Robin Wright have more leverage than your average worker. But there is a revolution of sorts going on, as women are finding new ways to get back to work after a gap in their résumé and demanding fair compensation. “I would say it’s a revolution based on the reaction we’ve gotten,” said Jennifer Gefsky, the   of Apres, which places people (men too) who are looking to reenter the workforce in jobs. The company launched two weeks ago and already has 10, 000 women signed up ready for hire, 20 companies “officially on board” and is “in serious talks” with 250 more companies. “These women are so valuable. ” Of the women who have signed on with Apres, 68 percent are looking for   work and 50 percent have a graduate degree, Gefsky said. They may have taken time off, but they are ready and eager to work. Oh, and they still have that graduate degree and experience that they acquired before they became moms. Just like Robin Wright was a hugely talented actress before she had kids, and (surprise) she still is. Gefsky was a lawyer and worked in a demanding job with Major League Baseball. But, like many new moms, she found herself commuting more than two hours each day, spending a lot of time at work, little time at home and feeling like she was not doing anything well. So she quit. “To be honest, I wasn’t thinking ‘What will I do three or four years from now?’ I was just relieved I was able to exhale. ” When she was ready to reenter the workforce after seven years away, she found it difficult. “I never had to look for a job as a lawyer before,” she said. “I was always recruited. ” So Gefsky and her   Niccole Kroll started Apres based on a need they saw in her own lives. Any company that has signed on with Apres knows it is getting a woman with a gap on her resume. In other words, those companies win while other companies who don’t compensate their returning mothers well, or who aren’t paying attention to how they are treating the working women in their organizations, are going to lose some powerful,   employees who also happen to be mothers. Or maybe even a star. You might also be interested in: Are you holding your own daughter back? 5 ways to raise them to be a leader.

"Armed, Confederate flag-waving White Lives Matter protesters rally outside Houston NAACP.          White Lives Matter staged a rally outside the NAACP’s Houston headquarters on Sunday, sparking controversy and counterprotests in a city where racial tensions remain high after a string of recent incidents. Clutching Confederate flags, white supremacist signs and, in several cases, assault rifles, roughly 20 White Lives Matter members stood on the sidewalk of a historically black neighborhood to denounce the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. “We came out here specifically today to protest against the NAACP and their failure in speaking out against the atrocities that organizations like Black Lives Matter and other   organizations have caused the attack and killing of white police officers, the burning down of cities and things of that nature,” organizer Ken Reed told the Houston Chronicle. “If they’re going to be a civil rights organization and defend their people, they also need to hold their people accountable. ” Reed, who was wearing a “Donald Trump ’16” hat and a “White Lives Matter” shirt with white supremacist symbols, said protesters were “not out here to instigate or start any problems,” despite the weaponry and body armor on display. “Obviously we are exercising our Second Amendment rights but that’s because we have to defend ourselves,” he told the Chronicle. “Their organizations and their people are shooting people based on the color of their skin. We’re not. ” Reed appeared to be referring to attacks targeting white police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge last month, which were carried out by lone gunmen espousing black nationalist beliefs. (In Dallas a Latino officer was killed and in Baton Rouge, an African American officer was killed). Both Black Lives Matter and the NAACP denounced the attacks.   [Biden at police vigil: We’ve got to see each other as ‘individuals,’ not ‘objects’]   Sunday’s demonstration in Houston’s predominantly black Third Ward quickly spurred a counterprotest, which soon dwarfed the White Lives Matter gathering. As police arrived and set up barricades around the White Lives Matter protesters, locals stood across the street. Some shouted, while others shook their heads in disbelief that Confederate flags were flying in front of an NAACP office in a black neighborhood. “It’s a physical manifestation of white supremacy, white privilege and racism being protected by this country,” a black female counterprotester told KPRC2. The White Lives Matter protest comes at a tense time for Houston and the country. On July 9, Houston police fatally shot a black man who they said pointed a gun at officers. The shooting, which came the same week as fatal police shootings of two other black men, one in Baton Rouge and another in Falcon Heights, Minn. prompted criticism from Black Lives Matter activists. The Houston shooting came two days after the attack on Dallas police.    A White Lives Matter protest outside the NAACP office in Houston on Sunday. (Courtesy of Andre Smith)  Several other incidents in the city have raised racial tensions even further. At the University of Houston, the vice president of the Student Government Association was sanctioned after she wrote “Forget #BlackLivesMatter   …     More like AllLivesMatter” on Facebook shortly after the Dallas attack. Earlier this month, authorities released video showing an African American woman calling 911 and saying she was “really afraid” of a white cop who had pulled her over. The woman was then violently arrested, although the officer was cleared of wrongdoing.   [A black woman called 911 because she was afraid of a police officer. A violent arrest followed.]   In May, city officials voted to rename seven schools named after people with ties to the Confederacy, including Robert E. Lee, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson and Jefferson Davis. Last year, the University of Texas announced it was removing a statue of Davis from its campus in Austin, about 160 miles west of Houston. Sunday’s rally was not the nation’s first White Lives Matter gathering. Others have drawn similarly small crowds, such as a July 30 protest in Buffalo that was organized by   and also was dwarfed by counterprotests. Comments by the White Lives Matter protesters Sunday also seemed to echo opposition to the removal of the Confederate flag from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse last summer. The flag was taken down after avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof allegedly killed nine African Americans at a church in Charleston. “It has nothing to do with racism on our part,” Reed told the Chronicle in reference to the Confederate flags on display at Sunday’s protest. “We’re proud to be Southern. It has all to do about heritage, nothing to do with hate. ”   [Confederate flag flies once again  —   for a few hours  —   at South Carolina statehouse]   In videos posted online by local news outlets, bystanders and counterprotesters, Reed appeared to be the leader of the demonstration. He had appeared on television the day before to promote the rally. “Attacks on white officers, the calling for the murder of white officers, the burning down of cities, the stopping of traffic in streets,” Reed told Fox26. “A cop or ambulance could be trying to take someone to the hospital where a matter of minutes matters, and [Black Lives Matter protesters] are stopping them from going. The NAACP is not speaking out against this and if you aren’t speaking out against it you are, in our eyes, condoning it. ” Whites were under attack, he claimed. “We’re being told that it’s bad to be white,” he told the television station. “Every other race is encouraged to promote their heritage and culture, but as soon as a white person does it they are labeled as evil or racist. ”    (Image via Twitter @Snapperred)  On Sunday, he stood out front of the NAACP office on Wheeler Avenue with a bullhorn. “White Lives Matter refuses to feel any white guilt,” he shouted, according to a KPRC2 video. “I ask Black Lives Matter and I ask the New Black Panther Party why, we ask why Black Lives Matter is not being labeled a hate group or domestic terrorist group,” he said into the bullhorn, according to Chronicle footage. Reed said he thought whites were receiving unequal treatment and had been drowned out by Black Lives Matter. “We’re out here just to show White Lives Matter has the right to support our rights and our heritage and culture, just as they do,” he told the Chronicle. “But they do not have the right to kill, they do not have the right to assault, they do not have the right to threat[en] and they do not have the right to damage personal property. ” Other protesters were even more blunt. “We came here because the NAACP headquarters is here and that’s one of the most racist  —   supposedly ‘civil rights’  —   groups in America,” said Scott Lacy, who could be seen waving a Confederate flag. “It seems like in the country today that it’s wrong to be white,” fellow protester Billy Gaston told KPRC2. One sign simply read “14 words,” a reference to the white supremacist motto: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. ” The protest struck many in the neighborhood as nonsensical and offensive. Quintana Richardson, who is black, said Reed’s demand for equal rights for whites didn’t fit with historical fact. “When he says ‘equal rights,’ that’s what we are trying to say. Let’s have equal rights. We’ve been saying that for years as black people,” she told the Chronicle.   White supremacists protest @naacp_houston and Black Lives Matter. Is this a part of what some call the ”Trump effect? pic. twitter.   —   Jose Grinan (@JoseGrinanFOX26) August 21, 2016   And whatever message White Lives Matter might have had, it was obscured by the symbols on display, Richardson said. “The Confederate flag throws me off,” she said. “You’re saying Black Lives Matter is a racist organization but when you’re throwing the Confederate flag up and you’re saying White Lives Matter, are you saying you’re racist as well?” Adding to the tension were the   rifles, which could be seen slung over the shoulders of at least two women and one man during the protest. Several protesters also wore body armor. Some locals said they felt like the White Lives Matter crowd had descended on Houston with no intention of holding a dialogue. “They didn’t even want to talk,” Trevor Clark, who is black, told KPRC2. “Things like this are going to continue to happen, tragedies are going to continue to happen if we don’t have an open dialogue. ” Brandon Walker, a reporter for the TV station, also said that there was little communication between groups literally on either side of the street. “Organizers of the White Lives Matter movement say they held this protest and were here to spark dialogue on both sides of the street,” he said. “Also, people who were here in response to the rally said they hoped to have some dialogue too. Neither side, though, said they were able to accomplish that. The rally ended before any conversation on either end of the street was slated to take place. ” It was much the same online, where there was lots of heated comments but little exchange of ideas. By Sunday night, “White Lives Matter” was trending nationwide on Twitter. Many poked fun at the protest. Jerry Ford Jr. a Black Lives Matter activist who appeared alongside Reed on TV the day before, linked the protest to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.   Trump got these folks bold as hell holding a White Lives Matter protest outside of Houston NAACP @rolandsmartin pic. twitter.   —   Jerry Ford, Jr. (@JerryFordJr) August 21, 2016   Some White Lives Matter supporters, however, suggested the movement was a    response. “Very few blacks were on board with All Lives Matter, so we are doing our own thing now,” wrote one on Twitter. “White Lives Matter. ” “We expect every race to be proud of who they are,” Reed said on Fox26. “We’re out there fighting for our rights just like everyone should. ” Many portrayed White Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter as equivalents. “Black Lives Matter is allowed. Why not White Lives Matter?” wrote one. “It’s either both of them or none of them. Pick one. ” “I don’t want to hear ‘White lives matter.’ I don’t want to hear ‘Black lives matter,’” wrote former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who has his own controversial history involving BLM. “Only ‘All lives matter.’ Got it? Good. Now grow up. ” Critics, however, said equating the two movements was absurd as it ignored centuries of slavery and institutionalized racism in America.  The fact that “White Lives Matter” is even a thing just proves that too many white people don’t understand what “Black Lives Matter” means.  —   a girl is no one (@OhNoSheTwitnt) August 22, 2016    ”White Lives Matter” has a silent ”only,” whereas ”Black Lives Matter” has a silent ”also.” One is racism, the other a call for equality.  —   David   (@David_EHG) August 22, 2016     The major difference:  Black Lives Matter (Too) White Lives Matter (More)  Remember that.  —   X (@XLNB) August 22, 2016     Anybody who thinks White Lives Matter is at all on the same level as Black Lives Matter is a lost cause.

On June 14, the World Health Organization reiterated that the Zika outbreak did not pose enough riskto warrant moving, postponing, or cancelling the summer Olympics in Rio. “The risk is already low. There is very low risk of further international spread from the Olympics,” said David Heymann, chair of the WHO’s emergency committee on Zika. The decision comes after more than 200 academics, many of them ethicists, signed an open letter asking the WHO to consider postponing or canceling the Olympics due to the mosquito-borne virus. The WHO still considers Zika a public health emergency because of its link to microcephaly. But if you drill down into the details about Zika, you can see why scientists and officials with specific knowledge of Zika don’t think the virus will be a big deal at the games. ",0.0
"Pepsi has pulled its controversial ad suggesting you can solve police brutality with soda.  On Tuesday night, Pepsi released a new ad starring Kendall Jenner to the internet. On Wednesday morning, less than 24 hours later, Pepsi pulled the ad from the internet.    But I can only imagine that when Pepsi first signed off on the ad, a scene like this played out:  INT. PepsiCo, Inc. corporate headquarters  —   office of Ron Draper Ron picks up a photograph of Don Draper and gazes into Don’s eyes. RON, whispered: I finally did it, Grandpa. I did it for you. I took your “I’d like to buy the world a Coke” ad and I made it sleazier and more exploitative.  That’s because the ad  —   which was titled “Jump In,” borrowed heavily from the imagery of the Black Lives Matter movement, and quickly drew vicious backlash on social media  —   is just the kind of thing Don Draper would love. But it didn’t exactly play well in 2017.    Pepsi eventually realized as much, and issued the following apology:    Pepsi was trying to project global a message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly, we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are pulling the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position. Inexplicably, much of the apology was directed toward Jenner, a grown adult who chose to participate in Pepsi’s campaign of her own free will. But the rest was directed toward the thousands of people who had spent the past few hours savaging Pepsi on social media.    Pepsi’s   ad suggests that we can stop police brutality by drinking soda “Jump In” was inexplicably almost three minutes long, making it impossible to play on television during a standard ad break. (The company described it as a short film.) The ad  —   which has disappeared from Pepsi’s official YouTube channel but remains on Jenner’s  —   features Jenner modeling in a blonde wig and dark lipstick, which signifies that she is a tool of The Man.  But then: Jenner sees a protest! Its participants are an attractively diverse group of   marchers, waving signs that endorse such controversial concepts as “peace” and “togetherness. ” Jenner whips off that blonde wig  —   she tosses it aside for a black woman to take; said woman looks unimpressed  —   and wipes away the dark lipstick. Then she magically swaps her   clothes for an   ensemble, signifying that she is now One of the People.     She’s just joined the marchers when she sees a wall of police officers standing in front of the protest, looking menacing. Not to worry. Jenner knows what to do. She hands a cop a Pepsi, and guess what? He drinks it.  The protesters go wild.   and cheering all around. A Muslim woman in a hijab snaps a picture to capture the moment the movement worked. Let’s all buy Pepsi. The backlash was almost immediate.  The ad inspired widespread outrage and mockery online Twitter is full of memes gleefully mocking the ad. People have   the idea that politely offering the police refreshment makes them less likely to react violently to a protest. They’ve   the idea that protests in general  —   and Black Lives Matter protests in particular  —   are scenes of lighthearted revelry, dismissing that suggestion despite the cheerfully dancing black men in Pepsi’s imagined protest. They’ve   the idea that white women are at the center of the Black Lives Matter movement while women of color stay in the background, documenting everything.

Corporations use social movements to sell stuff all the time. But Pepsi did an exceptionally poor job. Corporations have a long history of trying to cash in on countercultural movements, and  ’s “I’d like to buy the world a Coke” ad is only the most iconic example. If a brand does it right, there’s good money to be made: We tend to use consumer goods as shorthands for our identities, and if a brand can convince a whole social movement that it is their brand, the results can be extremely lucrative. This approach does sometimes work  —   Verizon got a string of good press in 2014 for its feminist ad campaign, for instance. But Pepsi’s ad was exceptionally tone deaf. It echoed iconic images from the Black Lives Matter campaign  —   particularly the famous photo of Iesha Evans facing down a line of cops in riot gear  —   but it replaced the people of color with a white woman, and the idea of protesting police brutality and systemic racism with the idea that we should all drink more Pepsi.       what you ordered online vs what comes in the mail pic. twitter.  —   black history heaux (@localblactivist) April 4, 2017    In contrast, the   Verizon ad was structured as a PSA about how important it is to tell girls they’re smart, and then flashed its corporate logo at the end. Make no mistake, Verizon was also   a social movement to try to sell something, just as much as Pepsi is now, but it still preserved the integrity of the movement’s message. Pepsi appropriated the Black Lives Matter movement’s imagery and replaced its message with a can of soda. Before the ad was pulled, a spokesperson for Pepsi said, “This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony, and we think that’s an important message to convey. ” Now that people from all walks of life have come together in a spirit of harmony to hate the ad, the irony of that statement is just important.

"How Bernie Sanders’s Jewish outreach coordinator started a major controversy over Israel.  Presidential campaign staff come and go; it’s the nature of the operative’s grueling lifestyle. But last week’s suspension of Simone Zimmerman, Bernie Sanders’s Jewish outreach coordinator, was very, very different. For one thing, she was only at the job for two days. Her ”suspension” wasn’t about burnout; it was the result of a controversy that tapped into a much larger debate over nature of the Sanders campaign and the future of the American Jewish community’s approach to Israel.    On its face, the suspension was about a few intemperate remarks Zimmerman made on her Facebook page about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March 2015, before joining the Sanders campaign. She described him as ”arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative asshole,” adding in a ”fuck you” for good measure. Probably not the smartest thing to say, and you’ve seen a predictably large mainstream   backlash to Zimmerman’s comments. But there’s also been a backlash to that backlash,   criticizing Bernie for backing down. It’s a giant, mostly   fight over what it means to be   today  —   as well as a neat window into the Bernie campaign’s struggles to engage on foreign policy. Zimmerman’s hiring was a slap in the face to the traditional Jewish establishment            I should disclose that Zimmerman is a personal friend. I met her through a mutual acquaintance when she was in college in 2013, and we’ve seen each other a handful of times since.    Knowing Zimmerman makes this controversy a bit baffling. If the Sanders campaign had done a little bit of research, it would have been obvious that Zimmerman’s hiring would provoke a backlash. She has made a career out of   attacks on the mainstream leadership of traditional Jewish organizations.    Zimmerman entered   activism while a student at  —   naturally  —    . She entered college with more mainstream views about Israel, the New York Times’ Jason Horowitz reports, but started to have doubts about the justness of Israel’s policy toward Palestinians during her time at Berkeley. Eventually, she joined J Street, the upstart   lobby founded in 2007, which became her passion. She was elected president of its student arm, J Street U, in 2012. After graduation, Zimmerman continued her activism. During the 2014 Gaza war, she founded an organization called If Not Now, a protest group that aims to change the conversation among American Jews on the   conflict.    If Not Now, in particular, exemplifies Zimmerman’s approach to the conflict. The group believes that the American Jewish community’s largely unconditional support for Israel makes the community complicit in the suffering of Palestinians  —   and aims to put direct pressure on American Jewish leaders to become more critical of the occupation. ”The    leadership of the American Jewish establishment tells us  —   young Jews who believe all people should have freedom and dignity  —   that our values are incompatible with our tradition,” If Not Now’s website says. ”As long as a fearful American Jewish community ostracizes those who see the Palestinians as human beings, deserving of  the same things we wish for ourselves, we cannot live with dignity.” In practice, that means staging   and protests at meetings of mainstream Jewish organizations, such as the   lobby AIPAC or Hillel.    The intellectual inspiration for this approach comes from an influential 2010 New York Review of Books essay by Peter Beinart, titled ”The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment.” In it, Beinart argued that what mainstream Jewish organizations, like the   lobby AIPAC and the   League, were losing touch with young Jews. Their staunch   stance alienated a newer generation of Jews more critical of the occupation.             In order to preserve any affection for Israel among younger Jews, Beinart argued, mainstream Jewish organizations need to champion what’s called ”liberal Zionism.” Liberal Zionism supports the existence of Israel, but believes that its continued occupation of Palestinian land is fundamentally devastating to the ideals and even   survival of the Zionist project. In order to save American Zionism, Beinart argued, the American Jewish leadership needs to start criticizing Israel more. This argument made Beinart hugely controversial in the American Jewish community  —   and a personal hero of Zimmerman’s. While she was involved in J Street U, a popular   among members had a stenciled picture of Beinart’s face with the caption ”Beinart’s Army” under it. He later became something of a mentor to her, hiring her to work on his   Daily Beast blog Open Zion. So when Sanders hired her, the campaign should have known that they were courting a major controversy. They hired an activist whose main claim to fame was staging demonstrations targeting some of the pillars of mainstream American Jewish life. The only reason to hire someone like Zimmerman is to make a statement: you stand with her, Beinart, and other dissidents from the ”Jewish establishment” consensus. What the backlash against Zimmerman reveals about Bernie            Hiring Zimmerman was controversial enough. But after the ”fuck you” comments came to light, the trickle of outrage became a torrent. Prominent American Jewish leaders  —   some of whom had been personally protested by If Not Now  —   were outraged.    ”I believe Bernie Sanders needs to fire Simone Zimmerman,” Abe Foxman, former head of the   League, said in an email to Jewish Insider. ”No amount of word changes can cure her ugly characterization of the Prime Minister of Israel and the Israeli army and people defending themselves.” Even some liberal Jews thought that keeping her on staff wasn’t a smart move for a Bernie campaign attempting to court Jewish voters. Jewish outreach coordinators, the argument goes, should be able to reach out to all Jews  —   not just the ones who share their   views on  . ”The question, to me, is not whether it’s OK as a matter of principle to [have] called Netanyahu an asshole  —   he most assuredly is,” Michelle Goldberg wrote in Slate. ”It’s whether a Democratic candidate for president can afford to be associated with that sentiment.” Hypothetically, the Bernie campaign could have stuck by Zimmerman. It would have been controversial, to be sure, but hardly a death blow to his campaign. To Foxman, they could have admitted that, while Zimmerman’s language choice was certainly intemperate, she was right to be angry about Israeli policy towards the Palestinians. She could apologize for the language without taking back the sentiment. To critics like Goldberg, they could say that the purpose of their campaign is mobilizing Jews like Zimmerman. Challenging the Democratic Jewish establishment’s consensus on Israel would be part of the campaign’s broader attack on the Democratic establishment’s complacent liberalism. A major theme of Sanders’s campaign, after all, has been that he’s mobilizing a silent   majority of progressive Americans. Why shouldn’t the ”political revolution” extend to Israel policy?    Indeed, Goldberg herself suggested this was an option. ”If the Sanders campaign is about broadening the space for progressive ideas in American politics, hiring a leader like Zimmerman is a great idea,” she writes. But while Sanders did hire her, it wasn’t for long. ”She has been suspended while we investigate the matter,” Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told the New York Times. I’ve asked the Sanders campaign repeatedly to clarify the nature the ”investigation,” or the duration of Zimmerman’s suspension, but so far haven’t heard anything. What this suggests, then, is that Sanders isn’t very committed to mainstreaming   foreign policy (or that he thinks keeping Zimmerman on would set back that cause). While he’s successfully taken an aggressive stance on domestic issues, seemingly boxing Clinton into supporting a $15 minimum wage (for example) foreign policy has taken a backseat. In debates, he often sounds uncomfortable talking about foreign policy. And foreign policy isn’t a huge part of his stump speech, or a major theme in the    attacks his campaign has launched against Clinton. Early in the campaign, you could blame this on a lack of advisers, but he now has a reasonable slate of foreign policy experts working with his campaign. This is clearly a strategic choice on his campaign: Prioritize domestic policy and sideline the foreign stuff.    One can debate the political merits of this decision. But it’s very striking when it comes to Israel, an issue on which he has demonstrated real fluency. At the last Democratic debate, just hours after his campaign suspended Zimmerman, Sanders was in strong form during an argument with Clinton over Israel. He did an impressive job articulating a liberal Zionist position not terribly far from Zimmerman’s, arguing that supporting Israel ”100 percent” is compatible with recognizing the damage the occupation is doing to Palestinians. He even talked about his time living in Israel, on a collective farm called a kibbutz. Yet, when faced with a chance to highlight these sorts of arguments by standing by Zimmerman, they backed down almost immediately. That could be because they decided that defending Zimmerman would set the liberal Zionist cause back. Or it could be that Sanders doesn’t care nearly as much about promoting a left approach to Israel as he does about economic policy, as sincere as his convictions on the issue seem to be. Now there’s some rare anger at Sanders on the left Almost as soon as Sanders suspended Zimmerman, he faced another wave of criticism  —   this time from the left. Take, for instance, freelance writer Jesse Myerson’s piece in the Marxist magazine Jacobin. Myerson is a huge Sanders booster  —   he wrote an entire cover story in the Village Voice lauding Sanders’s approach to Judaism as the best American Jewry had to offer. Yet he harshly attacked Sanders, accusing him of lacking the courage of his convictions on Israel. ”Millions of Americans vociferously agree with Sanders, and the bloody rubble in Gaza testifies that ’it is just too late for establishment politics,’” he wrote, using a quote from a Sanders speech. ”If he means it, he’ll reinstate Zimmerman.”    He wasn’t alone. Suspending Zimmerman was ”cowardly,” according to Allison Kilkenny,   of the   podcast Citizen Radio. ”Simone wasn’t saying anything radical,” she continued. ”It was very, very disappointing to see the Sanders campaign capitulate to that kind of smear tactic.” You can find more of these sentiments if you surf Twitter for #IStandWithSimone, where there’s a fairly healthy number of tweets from the past week:   #IStandWithSimone   she’s a Jew who fights for human rights + justice, and if you don’t stand for that you’re a disgrace. Shabbat Shalom!  —   Eli Valley (@elivalley) April 15, 2016      #IStandWithSimone   Jews who speak up abt the injustice of the occupation shouldn’t be threatened by the right wing for doing so @IfNotNow  —   Alexis Goldstein (@alexisgoldstein) April 15, 2016      Simone’s crime to her critics wasn’t that she used foul language. It was that she opposed the occupation. #IStandWithSimone  —   Jonathan Cohn (@JonathanCohn) April 15, 2016    These critics, to be clear, have a lot less political clout then the ones calling for Zimmerman’s firing. And no prominent Bernie supporters have threatened to abandon him over the Zimmerman kerfuffle. It seems exceedingly unlikely to hurt the Sanders campaign in any meaningful way. This is, beyond just this one campaign or this one election, the first of what is likely to be many skirmishes in the war over the future of American Jewry. And it’s not clear how they’ll go. Right now, clearly, the balance of power in the Jewish community favors a more traditional vision of Zionism. But if Beinart’s thesis is correct, and younger Jews really are more critical of Jews than the older generation, then sheer numbers could start to turn the tables. Dismissing the #IStandWithSimone crowd will become harder, both for mainstream Jewish organizations and Democratic candidates for office. ”Simone Zimmerman cares about Israel,” Beinart wrote in a Ha’aretz column on the affair. ”Treat people like her as the enemy and you make enemies of the best of the younger American Jewish generation.”    Now, Beinart could very well be wrong  —   the polling data is mixed, and quite difficult to parse. If he is, then Zimmerman and her ilk will continue to lose. If they can’t get the most successful, most   Jew ever to make a serious run for the presidency to have their back, then who would? But if he’s right, and Zimmerman is a harbinger rather than an outlier, then she can leave the affair with some satisfaction. Her views are getting more attention as a result of the controversy, and at least some people are rallying on her behalf  —   and social movements thrive on attention.     ",-1.0
"North Korea fires another ballistic missile, the 75th of Kim Jong Un’s tenure.   TOKYO  —   North Korea fired another ballistic missile early Saturday morning, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. Coinciding with renewed diplomatic and military pressure on North Korea from the Trump administration, this latest launch underscores both Kim Jong Un’s determination to make technical progress on his weapons programs and his defiance amid international pressure.  President Trump, who was briefed on the launch soon afterward, took to Twitter to reiterate his expectation that Chinese President Xi Jinping use his leverage to make Kim stop. “North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!” he tweeted.  Trump has repeatedly called on China, North Korea’s neighbor and largest trading partner, to punish the regime in Pyongyang, and he has warned Xi that if he doesn’t act, the United States will.   But Ralph A. Cossa, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Pacific Forum, said that the Trump administration appeared to be struggling to figure out how to deal with North Korea. “When it comes to foreign policy, and Korea policy in particular, the Trump administration has had a pretty steep learning curve, and it has been a lot more curves than learning,” Cossa said.  [  U. S. wants more U. N. sanctions over North Korea’s nuclear arms, warns time is short  ]  Saturday’s launch marked the 75th missile test since Kim Jong Un became leader of North Korea at the end of 2011, according to a Nuclear Threat Initiative database. American and South Korean defense officials said that the unidentified missile appears to have exploded soon after being launched at about 5 a. m. North Korea time.  “The missile did not leave North Korean territory,” U. S. Pacific Command spokesman Dave Benham said in a statement. North Korea’s previous missile launch was on April 16, the day after a huge military parade in Pyongyang to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of founder Kim Il Sung, and it also blew up almost immediately.       (The Washington Post)   But analysts said not to be consoled. “This test may have failed, but Kim Jong Un’s overall missile test record is 58 successful flight tests and 17 failures,” said Shea Cotton of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation, who compiled the Nuclear Threat Initiative database. North Korea is clearly making progress and has the political will, if not the technology just yet, to improve its missile technology. At this month’s military parade, North Korea presented two of its newest model missiles, including the   ballistic type it successfully fired last year and the   version it launched last month. Kim has repeatedly said that he wants an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States, and although there are still plenty technical hurdles to be overcome, many analysts believe North Korea will eventually get there.  [Worried about North Korea? Spare a thought for Otto Warmbier’s family.]  The latest launch comes amid heightened tensions in the region.  A U. S. Navy strike group, led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, will be in the waters around the Korean Peninsula this weekend, and one of the Navy’s largest submarines has been in port in South Korea this week. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday called for new economic sanctions on North Korea and other “painful” measures over its nuclear weapons program. “Failing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences,” Tillerson said during a special session of the U. N. Security Council. “The more we bide our time, the sooner we will run out of it. ” In its latest challenge to the United States, a North Korean propaganda outlet released a video clip this week showing simulated attacks on the United States and declaring that “the enemy to be destroyed is in our sights. ”  Missy Ryan in Washington contributed to this report.

"Yahoo CEO Mayer wields knife in bid to save her own skin. Under the gun, Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer on Tuesday reached for the knife. Mayer unveiled plans Tuesday to cut the payroll of the struggling Web portal by 15 percent and said the board would explore “strategic alternatives” for its enfeebled Internet properties. The elimination of 1, 700 jobs comes as Mayer fights for her own position. Activist shareholders have pressed the board to replace top brass at the Sunnyvale, Calif. company  —   which has seen its stock price tumble 34 percent in the last year. In addition to the strategic moves, Mayer reported after markets closed that Yahoo’s profits and revenue in the fourth quarter beat expectations. But the bar was set very low, and investor angst was not calmed. Yahoo had profits of 13 cents a share  —   but writedowns of Tumblr and other brands resulted in a net loss of $4. 4 billion, compared with a profit a year earlier. Revenue gained just 1. 6 percent, to $1. 27 billion. Yahoo shares slipped as much as 2. 3 percent in   trading after falling 1. 7 percent, to $29. 06, in normal trading. In comments during a conference call, Mayer admonished the press for stories about her company’s lavish, $7 million holiday party. That number was off by a factor of three, Mayer said, noting that the cost per attendee was a modest $150. Asked about the confusing,   track Yahoo is on, Mayer told Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente: “At the risk of sounding obvious, our situation is complex. We need to create the very best version of Yahoo. We also see a lot of value in the spinoff transaction. ” Mayer said the board would be taking the lead on dealing with “strategic alternatives. ” Many believe Verizon will likely scoop up Yahoo and add it to AOL, which it recently bought. Meanwhile, Yahoo reported in a filing that board member Charles Schwab is exiting. He is said to have been unhappy about the chaos inside Yahoo. A second board member, Max Levchin, exited in December. Activist investor SpringOwl responded to the strategic plan, saying in a statement that while its voice had been heard, “We believe the strategic plan does not fully address the core issues which have destroyed shareholder value. ”",1.0
"Donald Trump calls her ‘Crooked Hillary,’ but his fans just say ‘b----’.   GREENSBORO, N. C.  —   As thousands of Donald Trump supporters streamed out of an evening rally here this week, they walked past a handful of vendors from Ohio selling simple white   featuring Hillary Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and a vulgar joke. The back of the shirts read: “TRUMP THAT     !” One woman laughed and said to the man with her: “You have to get one!” A group of four   women pulled out their wallets and tried to bargain the vendors down from $20. One of the vendors shouted again and again: “Trump that     !

From a voter’s point of view, I think we have the right. . . . If that’s how we feel, we should have the right to say it. And I would tell it to her face if she walked up. That’s how I feel about her. ” At most of Trump’s rallies, there is a palpable hatred of Clinton in the air, and some of Trump’s strongest applause lines come when he attacks the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, calling her “crooked” and accusing her of playing “the woman’s card. ”   [Negative views of Trump just hit an   high: 7 in 10 Americans]    Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump targeted Hillary Clinton April 18, saying, ”We are going to beat ’crooked Hillary’ so badly that your heads will spin.” (Reuters)   But many of his fans have chosen a different nickname for her  —   one starting with a “b” and rhyming with “witch. ” The word is often shouted from the audience as Trump attacks her, murmured in   conversations and typed on Twitter. It appears on a popular button sold by vendors at many rallies: “Life’s a      don’t vote for one. ” And, most prominently, it is on those white   created by the   Street Talk Tees and sold at nearly all of Trump’s rallies. Although some women may casually use the term among friends or as a sign of empowerment, the   is still widely considered a particularly aggressive and demeaning insult when hurled at a woman, especially if it comes from a man. Many supporters of Clinton  —   poised to become the nation’s first female presidential nominee  —   feel the word is loaded and offensive. Clinton’s campaign declined to comment. The commonplace use of the term among Trump boosters also doesn’t seem helpful to their candidate, who has dismal popularity ratings among women. Most of the shirts are bought and worn by younger men, although plenty of women purchase them, too. In an interview last month, Trump said he was unaware that his fans were using the term. “They’re what? They’re calling her what?” Trump said, as the word was repeated to him a second time. “I have not heard that. I don’t like that. But I have not heard that.

"Kristen Stewart’s ‘Personal Shopper’ will get under your skin. For my money, the best thing about “Personal Shopper” was learning of the Swedish painter Hilma af Klint, who was doing wild abstract art before anybody else and claimed it was being dictated by spirits from the great beyond. Like the fleetingly mentioned Klint’s paintings (Google them, I’ll wait) this ghost story from director Olivier Assayas (“Clouds of Sils Maria”) is a seemingly random assembly of ethereal images and meditations that scratch at your brain in interesting ways. “Personal Shopper” doesn’t have much of a plot, but if you can tune into its languid frequency, it will get under your skin. Kristen Stewart plays Maureen, a young woman living a   existence in Paris as errand gal to a   model (Nora von Waldstatten). In between boutique trips on her motor scooter, Maureen tries to make contact with her late twin brother, Lewis; the siblings, who believed themselves psychic, made a pact that whoever died first would give the other one a sign afterward. She’s living in something like purgatory herself, hoping to connect with the dead and not really knowing where she belongs in the land of the living: Like her brother, she’s got a heart defect that might take her at any moment. The only times we really see her light up are when she’s sneaking a   of her boss’ posh apparel. There’s a boyfriend (Ty Olwin) who Skypes in from time to time, and eventually a murder, but most of what “Personal Shopper” does is just drift along with Stewart’s character on her errands, of both the supernatural and mundane variety. To her credit, Stewart makes this   woman show not only watchable but truly   in places. That said, her   acting tics, like stammering and   threaten at times to spiral out of hand. Ultimately it feels like a cinematic shopping trip: Assayas grabs a bunch of   stuff  —   grief, materialism, technology,   spiritualism  —   and hopes some of it fits.

Trump said a “renewed effort” will lead to an   peace deal. “I’ve heard it’s one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling we will get there eventually, I hope,” he said. “There’s a lot of love out there. ” The joint statement by the two leaders came as the White House put “Jerusalem, Israel,” on its website. US policy doesn’t hold that the city is part of Israel. Rather, previous Democratic and Republican administrations have said Jerusalem’s status must be solved through US negotiation. A screen previewing the upcoming statements by Trump and Netanyahu noted the location as “Jerusalem, Israel. ” The Trump administration had said ahead of the president’s visit that he wouldn’t recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, a pledge he made during the campaign. But people familiar with Trump’s trip said officials might offer a subtler gesture to recognize Israel’s strong feelings about Jerusalem being the country’s eternal capital. Netanyahu said he was “absolutely delighted” to welcome Trump and first lady Melania Trump to the “united capital” of Israel and the Jewish state.  and Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Netanyahu told Trump that Israel “protects the Christian sites like no one else does in the region. ” “We are committed to freedom of all faiths,” he said. Netanyahu also praised Trump for being the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall. “The people of Israel applaud you for it,” he said. Netanyahu also thanked Trump for the “change on US policy on Iran  —   how much we appreciate your bold decision to act against the use of chemical weapons in Syria and how much we appreciate the reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East. ” He said the two countries “together can roll back Iran’s march of aggression” and “thwart Iran’s unbridled ambition to become a nuclear weapons state. ” He pledged to work together toward a Mideast peace. “It won’t be simple. But for the first time in many years, and Mr. President, for the first time in my lifetime, I see a real hope for change,” Netanyahu said.",1.0
"The Web-Shaking Mirai Botnet Is Splintering---But Also Evolving. Over the last few weeks, a series of powerful hacker attacks powered by the malware known as Mirai have used botnets created of internet-connected devices to clobber targets ranging from the internet backbone company Dyn to the French internet service provider OVH. And just when it seemed that Mirai might be losing steam, new evidence shows that it's still dangerous—and even evolving. Researchers following Mirai say that while the number of daily assaults dipped briefly, they're now observing development in the Mirai malware itself that seems designed to allow it to infect more of the vulnerable routers, DVRs and other internet-of-things (IoT) gadgets it's hijacked to power its streams of malicious traffic. That progression could actually increase the total population available to the botnet, they warn, potentially giving it more total compute power to draw on. ",0.0

"Woody Harrelson shines as a comedic misanthrope in ‘Wilson’. You’ll likely be familiar with Woody Harrelson’s title character in “Wilson”: He’s the dude who sits down next to you on a plane or subway or park bench, and proceeds to rattle on endlessly with zero need for input. The fact that you’re not saying anything registers  —   to him  —   as rapt interest instead of a fervent wish for him to go away.  But Wilson is both more prickly and more enjoyable than your average windbag monologist; if only all   were scripted by graphic novelist Dan Clowes (“Ghost World”). Adapted from Clowes’ comic and directed by Craig Johnson (“The Skeleton Twins”) the lightweight, profane comedy “Wilson” is about your friendly neighborhood misanthrope, a curmudgeon who can’t resist imposing his disgusted worldview on everyone who crosses his path. He disdains the modern world  —   technology is for suckers, small talk is heroically populist  —   while insulting friends and foes alike. He’s an   underachiever who doesn’t get that teen angst plays less well when you’re  . Unsurprisingly, Wilson has few pals beyond his dog and his dad, and when the latter dies, he embarks on a mission to reconnect with his troubled, recovering addict   Pippi (Laura Dern, who does troubled like nobody else) and discovers she gave their daughter up for adoption 17 years ago. “Wilson” has much of the same broad,   humor that gave Clowes’ earlier work its sardonic punch, and Harrelson has a ball delivering barbs with a goofy grin on his face. That said, there’s a certain calcified quality to this shtick, and not a small amount of misogyny. Wilson’s casually cruel to a   single woman (Margo Martindale) and then, somehow, earns the affections of his lithe dog sitter (Judy Greer). It’s the same sort of fantasy we saw in “Sideways”: the bitter schlub as heroic  . But the lamer aspects of “Wilson” are somewhat redeemed by its punchy female supporting cast: Isabella Amara, as his teenage daughter, Claire, is a spiritual sister to the   teenagers of “Ghost World”; and Dern stands in for all of us when she wallops her snarky ex with her overstuffed handbag. “Wilson” doesn’t have the emotional heft, or the narrative arc, of Johnson’s last film, but it does remind you how much fun it is to watch Harrelson. In real life, Wilson would just be a   a     hole.",1.0

"Hillary Clinton’s Caymans-tax-dodge hypocrisy. Hillary Clinton last week lunged into her most flagrant fit of hypocrisy yet. With Bernie Sanders surging, she took new aim at the rich  —   including their use of tax dodges. She told MSNBC: “We can go after some of these schemes   …     the kind of misclassifying of income, trying to make it look like it’s a capital gain, when it’s really ordinary income, going ahead and routing income through the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands or wherever. ” Huh. Bloomberg News reported in 2014 on the Clintons’ use of a prime tax dodge: They put their Chappaqua home into a “residence trust” in 2010. Such trusts can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes. Meanwhile, the Clintons’ family wealth has grown   thanks to firms with significant holdings in places like . . . the Caymans.

In 2011, her hubby also earned at least $225, 000 in speaking fees from Whisky Productions for an “event that will target the business community in Grand Cayman. ” It’s a family thing: Chelsea Clinton’s hubby, Marc Mezvinsky, is a partner in a hedge fund with multiple holdings incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

"What to expect when ‘The Walking Dead’ returns. When we last left “The Walking Dead” in   Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his band of survivors were finally reunited. The show’s disjointed first fall season skipped between various communities including Alexandria, Hilltop Colony, the Kingdom, the   Oceanside and Negan’s (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) compound at the Sanctuary. Negan’s reign of terror   as he and the Saviors killed Spencer (Austin Nicols) and Olivia (Ann Mahoney) and kidnapped Eugene (Josh McDermitt). But the despite the bloodshed, the episode ended on note of optimism, with Rick, Michonne (Danai Gurira) Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Daryl (Norman Reedus) reunited at the Hilltop. And Rick, who spent the better part of eight episodes sulking defeatedly under the tyranny of Negan, proved he’s finally ready to fight back. With the zombie drama returning for the second half of Season 7 Sunday at 9 p. m. on AMC, here’s a look at what to expect in the next eight episodes. As AMC wrote in its description of Season 7B, “The second half of the season will focus on preparing for war and gathering the supplies and numbers to take Negan down once and for all” and that “victory will require more than Alexandria. ” So expect the various new communities we visited in the first half of the season to come into play  —   though as we’ve seen, many of those leaders would rather not stir up the pot. Maggie and Sasha (Sonequa  ) had to take charge of the Hilltop before in the face of its submissive leader Gregory (Xander Berkeley). And the women of Oceanside made it quite clear to Tara (Alanna Masterson) that they have no desire to be found. Remember King Ezekiel (Khary Payton)   in Episode 702 then never seen again? Well he’s back, as teased in a   video of the midseason premiere and the fact that the actor is booked as a guest on the “Talking Dead” after show that evening. In the debut, titled “Rock in the Road,” the episode description says that “Rick and the group are led to a new community where they are introduced to its inhabitants and ruler. A familiar face resurfaces”  —   which sounds a lot like our   King. We also know that Ezekiel doesn’t like bloodshed  —   he does his deliveries to the Saviors outside the Kingdom to keep his subjects sheltered  —   so convincing him to join the fight may require more than one of Rick’s motivational speeches. The last “Walking Dead” episode showed a pair of boots belonging to an unseen wearer spying on Rick, Aaron (Ross Marquand) and the others throughout the hour. So who do they belong to? “We’ll meet new survivors in incredible places,” the AMC season description teases. A photo revealed by Entertainment Weekly last month   at what looks like a junkyard and a female character, with her back to the camera, staring down Mr. Grimes. Could she be the mysterious boots’ owner? Apparently, we’ll get an answer soon enough (TV Guide reports the photo  ). “I’m just going to say that Rick is going to meet this person   persons pretty quickly,” showrunner Scott M. Gimple told EW. “The answers are just around the heap. I cannot wait for people to meet this character and to see this actor. There is some formidable fun coming up. ” The AMC description also warns that “we’ll see treachery from people we trust,” and that seems to be backed up in comments made by   Lennie James who plays Morgan, last seen settling in and teaching his weapons skills at the Kingdom. “The second eight [episodes] is very much about meeting all the protagonists [in the war],”  . “And there are certain events that are going to decide what sides people take on that. It’s not going to be a clear division of labor. Some people are going to go to the dark side, who are going to take you by surprise, and some people are going to come over to the light. ”        ",1.0
"De Blasio should stop blaming others for his incompetence. Consider this a “teachable moment,” Mr. Mayor: City Comptroller Scott Stringer has just put the lie to your claim that your administration’s indefensible OK of the Rivington   flip was just an innocent “mistake. ” Not to mention your equally lame insistence that the real problem was procedures inherited from the Bloomberg team  —   not incompetence, or worse. Stringer’s investigation found that Rivington was allowed to “slip away” not because of “poor City processes, but because of bad execution. ” In other words, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his staff screwed up  —    . The comptroller’s report Monday follows an   Department of Investigation probe that reached similar findings  —   and also raised charges of a City Hall coverup. De Blasio claims he first learned the health care facility had been sold over community objections for luxury condos from news stories in March. But Stringer found that the process  —   dating back to the first days of the mayor’s term  —   involved “dozens of Administration officials, including three Deputy Mayors, the Directors of the Mayor’s Offices of Intergovernmental Affairs and Contract Services, three City Commissioners and numerous members of their staffs. ” Either de Blasio’s staff doesn’t tell him what’s going on, or he’s spending too much time in the gym. Or maybe he’s just conveniently deaf on certain matters. In fact, Stringer found, Team de Blasio got played by Joel Laundau and his Allure Group, who walked away with a $72 million profit  —   and who plotted to turn the nursing home into luxury condos before they’d even bought the building. Landau also convinced the city he needed the deed restrictions lifted in order to finance reopening the site as a health care facility  —   when he’d already signed a contract to sell to a real estate developer. All of which makes the mayor’s refusal to hold anyone responsible  —   despite his specific promise to do just that  —   astonishing. Oh, well: There’s always Preet Bharara . . .",1.0
"Use Science (Not Surgery) to Create Your Best Selfie. Around 2013, plastic surgeons like Boris Paskhover started to notice a bizarre trend in their doctor’s offices. More and more young patients—under 40, as young as 20—were asking for nose jobs. In Paskhover’s office in New York, new patients would plop down, hand over their phone, and complain about how their schnoz looked in selfies. In turn, Paskhover would hand them a mirror and tell them to take a look. “This is what you really look like,” he says. Selfies, particularly up-close ones taken at certain angles in front of the face, tend to distort the nose. It’s almost like the side view mirrors on your car—objects on camera may appear larger than they are. And it's not just Paskhover noticing the trend; a poll of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons showed that 42 percent of surgeons have seen patients specifically looking to up their selfie game. As Paskhover continued to see cases in his office, he became fascinated with what happens when people take up-close selfies—and he wanted to find a more scientific way to explain it to his patients. So he and colleagues at Rutgers University and Stanford University created a mathematical model to show how a camera's distance from a face changes perceived nose size. They started with data from a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey, one that has measured Americans’ heads for the past three decades to fit respirator masks. They used that info to build male and female heads of average width and nasal projection, measuring how wide the nose appeared to be relative to the face's width from ear to ear—the so-called bizygomatic breadth—at a number of camera distances. Their findings? At 12 inches, or about the distance of a selfie, the lens distorts the face and makes the nose—or whatever is closest to the camera—appear 30 percent larger. At a normal portrait distance of about five feet, however, features don’t get distorted, they reported in the medical journal JAMA Plastic Surgery in March. “Selfies have changed the way we view ourselves,” Paskhover says. “We’re getting closer to people’s faces than we ever did, and it’s changing our viewing habits in a hypercritical way.” As any experienced selfie taker can attest, the best pics are all about the #angles. Until recently, however, little evidence supported popular tricks for better selfies beyond taking thousands of photos and learning. But several new studies, including Paskhover’s, point to the research behind putting your best face forward. In general, whatever feature is closest to a smartphone camera will be exaggerated. As every good professional photographer knows, lens distortion occurs when you stand close to your subject with a wide-angle or zoom lens (hint: think of the funky optics that occur with fish-eye lenses and door peepholes), which deals with the geometry of focal length and distance to the subject. Instead of taking a selfie head-on, which focuses on your nose sticking out from your face, move the camera or your head to the side about 10 to 15 degrees. If you want to appear to have a chiseled jawline, Paskhover says, lift your chin a little to push it out in front of your nose. “It’ll make your jawline appear larger and stronger,” he says. On the other hand, you can lean forward into a picture to emphasize high cheekbones and bigger eyes. By shifting your nose and ears into the same parallel plane, it’ll remove them as the more protruding focal point and push the cheeks closest to the camera. For a longer, slimmer neck, emphasize that focal length distortion by pushing your shoulders down and extending your head away from your neck, says Ashley Carman, a tech reporter at The Verge who co-hosts a podcast about technology, which featured selfies in the most recent episode. “To emphasize that nice angle on your face, tilt your head or put your hand under it to frame your face,” she says. If you want to show your best side, consider offering your left cheek. Historically, people posing for portraits—from classic paintings to recent photos—tend to put their left side forward as their “best side.” Selfies are no different, says Annukka Lindell, a psychologist at La Trobe University in Australia. Lindell and others studied the 10 most recent selfies for 200 people on Instagram and found that we really do prefer the left side in photos. But do our viewers feel the same way? Lindell is studying that now to understand if left or right cheeks garner more likes and comments. “People really do have a ‘best side’ (or at least they think they do!),” she says. “But whether this is reinforced by perceivers’ positive feedback isn’t yet known.” Researchers and professional photographers also suggest positioning the camera above eye level, especially if the camera is close. But don’t take it to MySpace levels—just a few degrees is fine. “This is always going to be more flattering, as opposed to shooting from a low perspective,” says Larissa Cleveland, a San Francisco-based professional photographer who shoots fine art weddings and editorials. A 2017 study from Germany backs this up. Researchers asked 172 participants to rate the perceived attractiveness, helpfulness, sympathy, dominance, and intelligence of 14 3-D faces shot at different angles. Shooting from above—at 30 degrees or less—significantly increased attractiveness, and shooting from below was associated with higher body weight. Selfie stances also differ by platform, researchers have noticed in the past year. Although the general principles regarding distortion remain the same, the psychology behind #angles may differ. On Tinder, for instance, men tend to tilt their cameras from below to appear taller and more powerful, and women tend to hold their cameras from above, which makes them look shorter and more submissive. “On dating apps, selfies are often the first picture you see of someone, and Tinder users are very focused on appearance and attracting mates,” says Jennifer Rokaya Sedgewick, a psychologist at the University of Saskatchewan who published this Tinder-tilting research in the journal Frontiers of Psychology last April. “Women and men portray themselves using different camera angles, which may not be the most attractive to the perceiver,” she says. “We’re learning more about the ways people perceive others on those apps.” -Selfies have moved beyond a form of self-expression to a revenue-generating business model. Behold, the made-for-Instagram museum. -The selfie is even informing the ways manufacturers design phones. -No angling or juiced-up tech is ever going to beat the appeal of a selfie in a rad location—and these skyscraper window-washing workers have everyone beat.",0.0
"Home Depot bucks sluggish retail trends. Home Depot’s   profit and   sales topped estimates as customers spent more on expensive items such as appliances and flooring and roofing materials. The company’s shares rose about 2 percent to hit a record high of $160. 83 in morning trading on Tuesday, after the No. 1 US home improvement chain also said   sales were off to a good start. “While US GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class and our sales thus far in May have been very good,” Home Depot’s Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé said on a conference call. Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe’s have remained a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy and higher wages are driving new home sales and an increase in the value of existing houses has spurred remodeling activity. Home Depot’s results are in contrast to falling sales at department stores such as Macy’s and JC Penney, which are struggling with lower customer spending on apparel and growing competition from online and   retailers. Sales of   items, which are priced above $900 and account for a fifth of total sales, rose 15. 8 percent in the first quarter ended April 30, Home Depot said. Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 5. 5 percent, above the 3. 9 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Comparable sales at US stores increased 6 percent. The number of customer transactions was up 1. 6 percent in the quarter, while the average ticket value rose by about $2 to $62. 39.

"Under Trump, your Nikes could cost more. American companies from appliance makers to auto parts suppliers have lined up to offer a quiet caution to   Donald Trump as he considers pulling the US from trade deals: Most lost manufacturing jobs aren’t coming back, but higher costs for consumers could. Consider the sneaker industry, one of the first to move to Asia because of the sharply lower cost of production in China and Vietnam. Nike and its smaller, privately held rival New Balance split over the question of whether the US should back the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. But if Trump and a   Congress   both companies and the analysts who track them agree Asia is poised to keep its dominance as the industry’s manufacturing hub. Companies like Nike have invested too much in those   economies to consider moving factories, even if tariffs rise and push up costs for American consumers, analysts say. Any new hiring in the US will be years down the road and depend on refining production technologies like   printing that could make it profitable to hire relatively small numbers of American production staff. The same dynamic applies to other industries, like auto parts, which have   over the past two decades, executives say. That suggests a problem that the Trump administration will bump up against if it tries to pursue a harder line on trade agreements from NAFTA to TPP. Shoe companies, like other manufacturers, could be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers, but few executives see a serious case for new hiring in the US because of a change in tariffs on imports. “The idea of moving shoe manufacturing to advanced countries is a little bit of a farce,” says Ed Van Wezel, CEO of   International, an   shoemaker that sells about 30 percent of its shoes in the US. The US imports about 98 percent of its footwear  —   2. 5 billion pairs last year, or nearly eight pairs for every man, woman and child. Shoemaking went offshore decades ago, mainly to China, because the process is so  . Making a single pair of running shoes can require up to 80 production steps. The average shoe worker in Vietnam earns about $245 a month, while shoe tariffs can range from zero up to 48 percent, according the US International Trade Commission. The average is just over 13 percent. “The ones that stand to lose out here are consumers, because if we start to eliminate trade deals, they’ll be paying a lot more for shoes,” says Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, which represents the industry in Washington. The same dynamic is seen in other industries. Ford CEO Mark Fields said last week that big tariffs on cars and trucks imported from Mexico would hurt the auto industry and the US economy. But he remained committed to making small cars in Mexico because the profits on making those cars in the US are so low. New Balance, based in Boston, makes only about a quarter of the shoes it sells in the US at its five New England factories, and figures that costs 25 percent to 35 percent more than it would to make them in Asia. The private company, owned by former marathoner Jim David and his wife, Ann, says it makes up for that cost disadvantage in part by producing   and customized shoes in those US plants. If the company were publicly traded, it would likely face pressure from shareholders to move all its production abroad. Beaverton, Ore.  Nike imports nearly all its shoes, and fought for the TPP, a trade deal that became a lightning rod in the recent presidential campaign. Nike said last year it would create 10, 000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in the US if the deal were adopted. Nike has clarified that those jobs would largely be aimed at creating more automated factories, not   production that would employ thousands of assemblers. New Balance fought the TPP, arguing that it would jeopardize its US plants by giving rivals like Nike more profits they could pour into developing new machines, products and advertising. That opposition has proven costly for the iconic brand. In the wake of the election, a New Balance spokesman welcomed what he saw as a likely defeat for TPP. Many critics seized on his comments as an endorsement of Trump, and some consumers burned their shoes. Backlash flared again after a   website proclaimed New Balance the “official shoes of white people. ” The company said the original comments were only meant to reflect its opposition to the TPP, not support for Trump. “For us, this is and always has been about the creation and retention of manufacturing jobs in support of our five New England factories,” the company said in a statement. Beyond the furor, shoemakers are experimenting with ways to take human labor out of manufacturing their goods, wherever they are made. Reebok, the Canton, Mass.  shoe company now owned by Germany’s Adidas AG, is building a laboratory in Rhode Island to refine a process to make shoes with liquid plastic. “We’re looking at the entire process of shoemaking from end to end with a clean sheet,” said Bill McInnis, who heads up the program to develop the company’s manufacturing process. Skeptics like  ’s Van Wezel emphasize that the industry’s advanced automation efforts are still years away from being able to produce whole shoes at large scale and at low prices. He says at least for now, many of the materials used to make shoes will continue to come from Asia because that’s where suppliers are clustered. “At this point, what you have is what we call ‘lick and stick,’ putting together uppers and outsoles imported from Asia,” Van Wezel said. “It’s as much about a public relations story  —   that you’re producing close to the market. ” Matt Powell, an analyst who follows the shoe and other sports industries for NPD Group, a market research group, said the main problem with the new technologies is that Americans like cheap shoes and demand them in huge quantities. “The only process of scale today is Nike’s Flynet,” he said. “They’ve made 1 million of those. But it’s important to remember that they sold 400 million shoes last year. So it’s still tiny. ”",1.0

The Great British Baking Show pits British bakers against each other for the honor of  …     just winning, actually               (the British shorthand for the show, used here for brevity) usually begins with 12 amateur bakers who compete to be crowned the ”star baker” of the week. What does being ”star baker” mean? It means  …     you were the best baker on the show that week. It does not imply you are the best baker in Britain, or the best home baker in the United Kingdom. Even if you win it all, there’s no prize money waiting, although past winners have often used a victory as a springboard to open bakeries or catering businesses or to write cookbooks. The stakes, in other words, are pretty low.    A typical episode lasts for just under an hour and consists of three challenges: 1) The signature challenge: Bakers are given a specific bread, pie, or cake as an assignment  —   a custard tart, for example, or dinner rolls  —   and must design and execute a recipe featuring the flavor combinations of their choice. (They’re given advance notice of the challenges so they can perfect recipes at home in advance of taping.) 2) The technical challenge: Bakers are asked to complete a difficult and fundamental recipe, such as a chocolate soufflé, with only   instructions and no advance warning. Unlike the signature challenge, which can produce very different variations on a theme (judges have to compare a chocolate tart to a lemon tart) the results of the technical challenge all look and taste very similar.    3) The showstopper challenge: Bakers must tackle a project that would usually be attempted only by professionals  —   such as a wedding cake, a tower of eclairs, or a tiered set of savory pies. Like the signature challenge, bakers get some warning so they can plan their recipes and approach. The final products are judged by Mary Berry, a prolific cookbook author, and Paul Hollywood, an artisan baker. Two British comedians, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, keep the competition moving along. The biggest drama ever on   would hardly be noticeable on most reality TV shows Here is the biggest controversy ever to hit The Great British Baking Show: During the fourth episode of the UK’s sixth season in 2014 (warning: minor spoilers ahead for the first season aired in the US) the contestants made baked Alaska on the hottest day of the year. One contestant, Iain Watters, put his baked Alaska in the freezer to solidify some melted ice cream. A fellow contestant briefly removed it, she claims by accident. The ice cream melted! Watters got frustrated, threw his baked Alaska in the trash, and then had to present the trash bin to the judges! Watters was sent home! This is, by far, the most dramatic thing that has ever happened on  . The British press dubbed it ”bingate.” The Guardian alone published 11 separate articles about the debacle. The show’s second biggest controversy involved two contestants who accidentally swapped custard while preparing a trifle. (”Swapped custard,” by the way, sounds a bit like the kind of double entendre  —   ”soggy bottoms,” ”ladyfingers,” ”dough balls”  —   that the   hosts love to giggle about.)    That’s it. That’s all the drama. But there is tension. The   challenges are difficult, and contestants are expected to execute them very quickly. I’ve made a wedding cake, and making the fillings and frosting alone took me roughly the same amount of time contestants have to bake and assemble an entire elaborate masterpiece.  The show’s producers, though, generally seem to be working from a different playbook than the rest of television, one that doesn’t include inviting mocking audience laughter or goading contestants into enmity. If a baker starts having a meltdown, hosts Giedroyc and Perkins stand next to them and swear or ”put our coats over them” so that the footage can’t be used, they told the Guardian in 2013. While American reality TV contestants are expected to confidently declare that they’re going to win it all, the standard attitude on   is that bakers are just happy to be there and, gosh, they really hope they don’t come in last. When they do, they nearly always accept the verdict with equanimity, grace, and a group hug.  Why is it so popular?   appeals to the best parts of our nature: the parts that love dessert and hate vicarious embarrassment.  Even if a contestant puts salt instead of sugar in an angel food cake  —   yes, this has happened  —   it’s safe to assume the judges, Hollywood and Berry, are direct but not cruel. They see their role as evaluating the bakers’ work, not competing for the most quotable, cruel, and cutting  . And the contestants are, by and large, people you actually want to root for.   is refreshingly willing to cast the best bakers it finds, even if they’re not blessed with conventional good looks or an outrageous personality. The producers dares to assume the audience will want to watch people who have gray hair or bifocals or a body mass index over 19, and their bet pays off.    Every season has a handful of men with   jobs  —   prison guard, builder, construction engineer  —   and the fact that these men also bake is treated as perfectly normal. (Its record on other kinds of diversity is spottier: Most contestants, though not all, are white and, while I’m no expert on the nuances of the British class system, appear to be broadly middle class.)  The contestants’ refusal to engage in    reality show antics  —   they’re allowed to go home during the week between episode tapings, rather than being confined in a house together, for one  —   is part of what makes watching   the same kind of cathartic, ultimately comforting experience as reading a cozy mystery novel with a cup of hot chocolate. There might be some upsetting scenes, but you know that in the end, justice will be meted out and order restored.  How British is The Great British  ?             It’s not just Brits who love  . The   recipe has been successfully exported to 20 other countries. Sadly, it flopped in the US. The uninspiring name The American Baking Competition didn’t help. But the American version also tampered with the ethos. Contestants weren’t allowed to go home on weekdays, as they are in the UK, and they were competing for something more than just honor. (Silvia Killingsworth’s analysis of why the formula failed to translate, at The Awl, is well worth reading.) But the Great British   in the original, is very, very British. The show evokes what social scientist Michael Billig has called ”banal nationalism”  —   the little, seemingly apolitical things that make up national identity. Banal nationalism in the US is ”The   Banner” at a baseball game on a summer afternoon, or the presidential habit of tacking ”God Bless America” onto the end of a major speech, or that Coke commercial where everybody sang ”America the Beautiful” in different languages.   is saturated in traditional ideas of Britishness. The competition takes place in a giant event tent pitched on the grounds of a grand British house. The original inspiration for the show was the baking competition at village fetes, the British version of the county fair. The interior of the tent is festooned with tiny Union Jack pennants. There are lots of Liberty of London —  esque floral prints. As the Guardian’s Charlotte Higgins wrote in an insightful essay about the symbolism and success of  :     Bake Off is pure English pastoral  …     It is Miss Marple. It is the National Trust. It is the first tableau in Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics: a village cricket match played out in a green and pleasant land. It is the England that then prime minister John Major vowed would never vanish in a famous 1993 speech: ”Long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers and  —   as George Orwell said  —   ‘old maids bicycling to holy communion through the morning mist’.  These signals mean that   ends up as an arbiter not only of baking, but also of Britishness, at a time when Britain is increasingly anxious about immigration, European integration, and national identity. The position   has staked out in that debate is broadly inclusive, although it can seem a bit tokenizing: Contestants with South Asian heritage usually end up creating recipes that incorporate traditionally Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi flavors. The metaphor for assimilation can seem a little too    with the   savory pie standing in for the melting pot. Still, the most recent season in the UK ended up sparking a debate  —   a Great British    if you will  —   on race, religion, and integration.  This is the season that’s set to air in the US starting in July. It’s hard to describe the details of the small media uproar without spoiling the outcome (a true shame, because this controversy was truly, gloriously absurd). But the issue at its heart  —   about whether representation for nonwhite,   residents of the UK represented progress or ”political correctness”  —   will feel sadly familiar to most Americans. Even on the world’s most comforting reality show, it turns out, you can’t entirely escape the echoes of the 2016 election cycle. Thankfully, though, the debate doesn’t play out onscreen. In the world of   the cake’s the thing. Nothing else really matters. No wonder it’s such an immersive delight. The first US season of The Great British Baking Show is available on Netflix and Amazon. The second is free to stream on PBS’s website. ",-1.0
"Your parents have a lot to do with when you lose your virginity. Deciding to swipe your V card is a BFD to most women, and the main event often comes after a lot of careful consideration. However, while we like to think that losing our virginity is our choice alone, new research says that your   actually help influence when you’ll take the    plunge. For the study, published in the journal  scientists examined the genes of 125, 667 men and women from Iceland and identified 38 sections of DNA that influenced when a person would have sex for the first time. (Hmm, wonder what “Jane the Virgin” would think of that.) Those DNA segments drive the release of   and when you start puberty, as well as behavior, personality and appearance. People with one of the genetic variations, CADM2, were more likely to have sex earlier in life, engage in more   behavior and have a large number of kids.   On the flip side, people with the MSRA genes were more likely to lose their V card at a later age and have irritable personalities (though there’s no word if that’s linked to horniness). Another weird finding: Women (but not men) who had the gene linked to   tended to lose their virginity at a later age. But whether that’s good or bad depends on the person, right?   As a whole, people who had sex younger were more likely to have their first child at a younger age, and were less likely to get a higher form of education. Another insight: Overall, the most common age for men and women to lose their virginity was 18. In case you were wondering where you fall on the spectrum. While the fact that scientists can get close to predicting when you first got down is pretty freaking fascinating, you should know that it isn’t   out of your control. Researchers say your DNA can sway up to 25 percent of your decision. Other factors, like religion, family background, peer pressure, and,   having a partner to do it with, make up the rest.",1.0
"GM and Lyft are teaming up to build self-driving cars — and take down Uber.  The   car wars are heating up. A few weeks after we learned that Ford and Google are creating a joint venture to develop   cars, General Motors and Lyft have announced a   joint venture of their own.    Lyft is raising $500 million in investment capital from GM along with another $500 million from other investors. Those other investors include two Chinese companies that are huge in Asia, albeit obscure in the United States  —   Alibaba in   and Didi Kuaidi in  . Together, it amounts to a global alliance to battle Uber, a direct Lyft competitor that is working on its own   technology. The odds of this new alliance triumphing seem slim, as it doesn’t have either the resources or the artificial intelligence expertise of Google, Tesla, Uber, and some of the other companies working in this space. But the deal does tell us a lot about how the global   market is evolving  —   and why competition in the   market is really just the prelude to a much bigger fight over dominance of the   car market over the next couple of decades. Here are four big lessons from GM’s deal with Lyft.    1) The future of   cars is rental, not ownership            We’re used to thinking about cars as personal property that people own. Taxis and rental cars exist, of course, but they’re niche products used in unusual situations or in a handful of central cities. Most households do most of their trips in cars the household owns.    I’ve argued before that   cars will flip this around. Without the need to pay a driver,   taxis will be so cheap that ordinary   consumers, even in the suburbs and smaller towns, will find them   for most trips. Indeed, because rental allows several people to effectively share a single vehicle, getting around via   taxi will likely become more affordable  —   not to mention more convenient and versatile  —   than owning a dedicated vehicle. If   rentals are the future of   car technology, then teaming up with an   rental service is a smart strategic move for a carmaker like GM. By the time   cars start showing up in the marketplace  —   likely sometime in the 2020s  —   many customers will have grown accustomed to hailing cars using a   service like Uber or Lyft. That will give them a lot of influence over consumers’ use of   technology, and so it makes sense that GM is acting now to make sure it has an ally in the   market.    2) Car companies know   vehicles are an existential threat            New car technologies come along all the time, and it would be easy for car companies to assume that   capabilities will be just another feature to add to their existing vehicles. But there’s reason to believe   technology is a much bigger deal, and that car companies that don’t adapt quickly won’t survive the transition. Putting software in control of cars is likely to be a lot more than a cosmetic change. Just as the internet is fundamentally transforming industries from music to retail  —   and threatening incumbents in those industries  —   so   cars are likely to prompt a fundamental rethink of how cars work. If cars are primarily rented, rather than owned, then they can be optimized for shorter trips and more heavily specialized for different use cases.     electric vehicles will become more practical. Companies may make cars in a wider variety of sizes and shapes, from     to luxury minivans to support family vacations. And car companies will also face new reliability and security challenges they’ve never faced before. When cars are controlled by software, they become vulnerable to hacking, and car companies’ current manufacturing techniques  —   which involve delegating most of the work to hundreds of subcontractors  —   make car software almost impossible to audit. If car companies don’t change their software development techniques, companies like Uber, Tesla, Google, and Apple are going to run circles around them.    Forming a joint venture with a prominent software company like Lyft gives GM a chance to start with a fresh slate. It could even be a sign that GM management recognizes that truly radical innovations will only take place if they’re insulated from GM’s bureaucratic culture. 3) The race to dominate the   car business will be global             GM is Lyft’s biggest new investor, but the latest round of funding also includes money from Alibaba (China’s answer to Amazon. com) and Didi Kuaidi (Uber’s biggest rival in China). These investments represent a growing recognition that   cars are likely to be a global market. Developing   technology won’t be cheap, and so companies that can spread those development costs across multiple big markets will have a distinct advantage. The United States and China are the world’s two biggest markets, so it makes sense that companies in these markets would team up. Once GM and Lyft have developed   car technology, they’ll be able to turn to Alibaba and Didi Kuaidi to help sell it to Chinese consumers. 4) The new alliance has a lot of catching up to do            Lyft is seeking new allies because it’s a huge underdog, as reflected by the terms of this new deal. Lyft sold shares to its new investors on terms that valued the company as a whole at $5. 5 billion. A few years ago, that would have been considered a high valuation for a   company, but it’s tiny compared with the more than $60 billion valuation of Lyft’s biggest rival, Uber. Lyft raised $1 billion in its latest fundraising round and $680 million total in 2015. By contrast, Uber has raised nearly $5 billion in the last year. Uber has been spending all of that cash not only consolidating its lead in US markets but also extending its reach internationally. Its global reach means that if and when Uber’s own   car project  —   which it has been working on for a year  —   comes to fruition, Uber will be able to deploy the cars in dozens of countries around the world. The   alliance will also have to play   with other companies that have big head starts in   technology:  Google has had working   car prototypes on the road for several years now, and has logged more than a million miles of   driving experience. Tesla’s cars already have some rudimentary   capabilities, and Tesla is working hard to make its vehicles fully  . CEO Elon Musk said in October that fully   cars are just a few years away.  Apple has also been working on a car project in the past year. Not much is known about what the company is working on, but with deep engineering talents and tens of billions of dollars in the bank, it shouldn’t be underestimated.  ",-1.0
"Kim Kardashian’s Taylor Swift-Kanye West Snapchat story, explained.  Fourteen years ago, when Taylor Swift was just 12, a woman named Whitney Houston asked for the receipts. It was a simple request. Journalist Diane Sawyer had asked Houston to comment on an alleged $730, 000 drug problem.    ”I wanna see the receipts.” Houston calmly replied, daring Sawyer to come up with an itemized list of purchases from Houston’s alleged dealer. She repeated: ”I wanna see the receipts.” The logic: No matter how off Houston might have seemed at the time, she wanted to see proof that she was consuming enough illegal substances to pay for a   Manhattan apartment. Sawyer could not manifest that proof. And even if Houston was most likely not of sound mind, no one had the receipts to pin her down. On that glorious day, the concept of receipts  —   the damning,   evidence that something occurred   —   was created. It wasn’t common to demand ”receipts” yet, but it would be. Taylor Swift, then 12, had no idea that Kim Kardashian would one day release the most damning pop music receipts in recent memory: Taylor Swift lied about Kanye West, and there’s video to prove it.    Kim Kardashian released THE conversation between Kanye and Taylor Swift on Snapchat On Sunday night, Kardashian posted a series of videos on Snapchat in which West, her husband, was talking to Swift on the phone about his song ”Famous”  —   a song that Swift has labeled as offensive and derogatory. Because Snapchat is a strange beast and everything on the social media platform is temporary, here is a (hopefully more permanent) video of what Kim posted, as recorded by a Kanye West fan Twitter account:       PART 1: Kanye calling Taylor Swift to tell her about the #FAMOUS lyrics. Courtesy of KKW. pic. twitter.   —   TeamKanyeDaily (@TeamKanyeDaily) July 18, 2016       In it, you can hear West clearly talking to Swift about his song in a really polite voice. She’s pretty cordial too.    ”I really appreciate you telling me about it. That’s really nice,” she says. ”It’s all very    either way.” If you’re just tuning in to the ongoing drama between Swift, West, and Kardashian, the video looks like two friends chatting. To unlock the full, swirling vortex of feuds you actually have to go all the way back to the beginning of the year. In February, Swift and West had a very public fight over lyrics he rapped in ”Famous,” then a new song. During West’s fashion   drop live event at Madison Square Garden, he dropped a verse about having sex with Swift someday, because he believes he made her famous:     I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex Why? I made that bitch famous God damn I made that bitch famous  Swift took offense to this. In a statement to the press, her team said the lyrics were inappropriate, noting, ”Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ’Famous’ on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.” West responded with a series of Twitter posts saying that Swift’s statement was bullshit and that he had specifically told Swift about the lyrics prior to the song’s release. He added that he even got approval from Swift, saying the lyric was her idea:            The fight between the two became a     version of events that culminated in a Grammys speech wherein Swift famously shaded West, implying that he was trying to take credit for her success.   ”As the first woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there will be people along the way who will try to undercut your success,” she said. ”Or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.” Essentially, this new video from Snapchat shows that Swift is being inconsistent, or not telling the entire truth. This video contradicts Swift and her publicist’s claim that West didn’t call Swift to get her approval of the ”Famous” lyrics, and that she tried to talk him out of releasing the song and the verse.    ”If people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘Look, he called me and told me about the line,’” she says in the recording  —   a sentence that’s so out of line with the public feud we’ve been watching ever since, you’d think it would be made up. Swift says the video only tells one side of the story To be clear: The video that Kardashian posted is edited. Due to the nature of Snapchat, which limits the length of continuous video you can post, there are several jump cuts and stops and starts. It’s possible that Kardashian could have simply omitted any portions that were unfavorable to West. But for the most part it doesn’t appear that Swift’s words are spliced together or edited in a misleading way  —   the videos use her full sentences. After Kardashian posted the recording to Snapchat on Sunday, Swift posted a response on Instagram, explaining that though she was cordial and encouraging when West called her to discuss the song, West ultimately pulled a bait and switch on her:            Swift’s story changes a bit. In that initial denial, ​she​ made it sound like there was no conversation with West  —   just a plea ​for her​ to release the song on Twitter. If you go by that account, all the politeness that’s seen ​in the video isn’t supposed to exist. ​But now that Kardashian made Swift and West’s conversation public, Swift’s ​new story is that when she and West talked, he didn’t tell her he was going to call her a ”bitch.” She says he didn’t give her the full story on the phone. In the recording, she and West discuss the line ”I think me and Taylor might still have sex” and West saying that he made Swift famous, but not the part where West calls her ”that bitch.” ”While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ of a song you haven’t heard,” Swift wrote on Instagram on Sunday. ”Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.” This fight is really about Taylor Swift’s image Taylor Swift and her success are a strange phenomenon. Critics and her biggest fans will openly tell you that she doesn’t have the best voice or the best technical skills. Her songwriting, while impossibly catchy, isn’t   or complex.    What she’s fantastic at is creating songs that crystallize a messy, usually teenage feeling that somehow speaks to everyone, even people who have never felt it, and weave it in with slips of her personal life. The personal life part of that skill is crucial. Every song she’s released throughout her career, every post she’s shared on social media  —   it’s all helped paint a portrait of Swift as your best friend. Her latest album, her tour, her Instagram photos, and her Facebook posts are all wrapped around the fantasy of being her pal and joining her coven of female friendship. With some pop stars, you want to be them; with Taylor Swift, you just wanna hang out with her. Kardashian’s Snapchat video cuts through that veneer  —   throwing doubt on what your BFF Taylor Swift is telling you, making you wonder, well, if Taylor could lie about that conversation with West, what else could she be lying about? The timing of this Snapchat is interesting too. Kardashian was featured in GQ last month, where she addressed Swift, West, and the song. She maintained that Swift knew about the song:  ”She totally approved that,” Kim says, shaking her head in annoyance. ”She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much shit for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.” Kim is on a roll now, speaking faster and more animatedly than at any other point during our time together. ”What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”  And on Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, this interview was teased out. To be fair, Kardashian isn’t just releasing this video to clear her husband and her name  —   she (and her team) knows how to market a   scandal.    Further, Swift’s ex, Calvin Harris, had some    things to say about Swift after it was revealed that she   one of his songs. It was implied that Harris never gave her the credit. ”I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry, who was part of a feud with Swift and the alleged subject of Swift’s song ”Bad Blood”]    but I’m not that guy, sorry,” Harris tweeted. ”I won’t allow it.” Harris paints Swift as cold and calculating. Her fights, Harris suggests, aren’t organic,   fights that happen out of nowhere. Instead, he implies they are actually planned out in advance, as marketing stunts. Swift’s celebrity hinges on the air of authenticity, which means her feuds are supposed to be real. They’re supposed to be genuine stories of her being wronged. They’re supposed to involve her showing all of us that even our best friend can get angry, and that we need to stick up for her. And when it comes to Swift’s feuds, none of them compare to her ongoing feud with Kanye West. Swift has, since that infamous Video Music Awards interruption in 2009, cast Kanye as a bully to her innocence, a liar to her truth teller. At the 2016 Grammys, she accused him of trying to take credit for her fame. Now she’s been recorded not only being nice and cordial to him about his song but also insinuating that it’d be good marketing for her and Kanye.    ”You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade,” she imagines herself saying to reporters and fans. ”But right after the song comes out I’m gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they’re gonna ask me about it and I’m gonna be like, he called me.” Hearing Taylor Swift think out loud about how to spin the story, to me, is more damaging than learning that Taylor Swift lied about Kanye West. It’s very possible that she thought taking offense to ”Famous” would be better for her career than showing the public that she and Kanye have patched things up. Harris’s Twitter outburst also makes that point  —   that there’s no hard feelings, just a savvy album and marketing strategy. Kim Kardashian’s Snapchat video reveals a Taylor Swift and Kanye West interaction that we didn’t know existed. But it also confirms that underneath the thick coating of bubblegum pop known as Taylor Swift, there’s a shrewd, savvy woman who puts a lot of effort into shaping and maintaining her public image  —   a person who we sort of knew existed but never really had the proof.

"Mets now plan to keep Jay Bruce as everyday right fielder. He arrived as a resuscitation paddle for a dying offense and then became insurance for Yoenis Cespedes’ free agency. Now Jay Bruce’s Mets voyage is prepared to dock at a destination both more traditional and less expected. The Mets have notified Bruce they anticipate starting the season with him as their everyday right fielder, an industry source told The Post. General manager Sandy Alderson said two weeks ago that Bruce, after being dangled in trade discussions for much of the offseason, could very well join the team at Tradition Field for spring training, and the team is now acting as if it will have Bruce for the entirety of the season. The Mets would of course slam the brakes on this plan if a late suitor presented an interesting package, but that appears a long shot. And given all of their health questions, the idea of having the durable Bruce, who has played in 137 or more games every season since 2010, holds additional appeal. A   foiled the Mets’ original plan to trade Bruce and his $13 million salary in return for a prospect and then use the payroll flexibility to acquire a reliever. None of those dominoes fell into place, meaning the Mets might very well try to go forward with their current bullpen core despite the absence of a veteran   to go after dangerous National League East lefty bats like the Nationals’ Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy and the Braves’ Freddie Freeman. The retention of Bruce, who turns 30 on April 3 (the Mets’ Opening Day) also has potential consequences for Michael Conforto, the Mets’ top 2014 draft pick who regressed in 2016 after a blazing 2015 debut. Depending on how spring training unfolds, Conforto could be part of the Mets’ outfield mix, or he still has   options available and could get more   at   Las Vegas. Another piece of the puzzle to consider: With first baseman Lucas Duda returning from a serious back injury, the Mets figure to try both Bruce and Conforto at first base in Grapefruit League action so they can further assess their options. Bruce played three games at first base for the Reds in 2014. David Wright, with his own back and neck problems, also could wind up in the   mix, with Wilmer Flores and Jose Reyes set as insurance pieces for Wright’s spot at third base. Bruce has been an imperfect fit   that sent   prospect Dilson Herrera and minor league pitcher Max Wotell to Cincinnati. The Mets made the trade because they desperately needed offense   …     and Bruce didn’t help much on that front, putting up a lousy . . . 391 slash line in 50 games and getting benched and booed, as Curtis Granderson slid over from right field to center field to make room for Bruce. Optimists can point out that in his final eight games of the season, when the Mets needed to win to get the NL   spot, Bruce went . . . 000 with four homers. Bruce owns a career . . . 467 slash line with 241 home runs. The Mets exercised Bruce’s team option shortly after the completion of the World Series because they wanted to protect themselves in case Cespedes, who opted out of his deal right around the same time, signed with another club.   gave the Mets an outfield surplus  —     Juan Lagares is set to be Granderson’s platoon partner in center field  —   that they now appear prepared to carry forward. If Bruce indeed stays put, the Mets must decide whether to increase their payroll, which is projected to be in the ballpark of $150 million, to upgrade their bullpen. With young options like Zack Wheeler (who has missed the last two years due to 2015 Tommy John surgery) and either Seth Lugo or Robert Gsellman available, the Mets think they have some coverage when Jeurys Familia gets suspended for violating baseball’s domestic violence program. However, their group of lefties is topped by the inexperienced Josh Edgin and Josh Smoker. Jerry Blevins, who limited lefties to a . . . 324 slash line in 68 games last year for the Mets, remains available as a free agent and is clearly interested in rejoining the club.",1.0
"Morgan starts as a nicely creepy sci-fi tale. Then everything goes horribly wrong..  It’s rare to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when a movie goes wrong, but it’s possible to do so with Morgan, the new   horror film from director Luke Scott (the son of Ridley).        Rating  2. 5     For roughly its first   Morgan is a deeply intriguing movie with one question at its center: Did Morgan, an artificial life form played by Anya   (whom you may remember as the protagonist of The Witch) harm one of the scientists caring for her because she’s been constructed incorrectly and is, thus, inherently violent? Or did she harm the scientist because she suffered a glitch? Yes, this premise is pretty similar to that of the terrific 2015 robot drama Ex Machina  —   also about an attempt to determine just how ”human” an artificial human really was  —   but Morgan offers a family dynamic among Morgan and the many scientists caring for her that Ex Machina didn’t have. In essence, the film asks, is it okay for the corporation that technically owns Morgan to kill someone these people think of as family, even if she’s dangerous to them? That’s a fun little   puzzle, as these things go. You can imagine the potential Twilight Zone episode that might have resulted  —   right down to the twist that also ends the film (which I’m going to spoil below, so be forewarned). But pulling off such a story requires a certain degree of thoughtfulness, and whatever thoughtfulness Morgan starts out with disappears as the film enters its final  .    And now let the spoilers begin.  Morgan’s best scene also marks its point of no return             Around Morgan’s halfway point, a major new character enters the story. As the psychologist tasked with evaluating Morgan’s mental workings, Paul Giamatti is at his rumpled best, irritated with the thought that he’s been brought all the way out to a farm in the middle of nowhere to talk to a robot.    But his opinion of Morgan will be key. If he says she’s fine, she’ll be allowed to live. If he deems her a threat, the scientists will be forced to put her to sleep. (A corporate hired gun, played by Kate Mara, is on site to make sure they do what they’re told.) Giamatti only appears in this one sequence, but it’s an impressive one. He begins talking to Morgan like he wants to be her friend, then slowly turns up the heat, until he’s all but daring her to hurt him, just as she hurt the other scientist. And in the end, she does, ultimately leading to the decision to terminate her. It doesn’t go all that well  —   Morgan becomes a horror movie villain and starts killing everyone, while Mara tries to kill Morgan instead.    The problem is that until this point, the film has been toying with ideas about whether Morgan is an actual sentient being, whether she deserves the same sort of rights that a human being might have  —   which would not include having essentially no autonomy   being the property of a corporation. However, it largely tosses those aside in favor of the ”everybody dies” ending. It briefly suggests that Morgan was baited by the psychologist, that she realized she was an entirely separate species and, necessarily, must be at war with her creators. But it invests too little effort in exploring this idea, instead favoring random bursts of violence and splatter. This is too bad, because the movie’s early going is frequently intriguing. And it’s filmed beautifully by Scott, who’s particularly fond of shots featuring the overlapping reflections of various characters as they talk to each other through glass barriers, an effect that allows for both eerie and surprisingly erotic moments.    But the pivot into full horror ultimately undercuts everything else Morgan was going for. Morgan ceases to be an intriguing philosophical quandary when she’s actively working to kill every human she meets. The film’s twist ending (which reveals that Mara is also a robot  —   something you could see coming after reading the film’s premise) tries to raise further issues of artificial intelligence and whether humanity might invent a successor that would cause humanity’s extinction. But it’s all too little, too late. Morgan starts out as an intriguing puzzle for the mind, but it ends up as a generic haunted house tale. At least Ex Machina built to a similarly horrifying conclusion much more organically  —   and in a way that acknowledged the moral complexity of the situation. Morgan mostly offers a   shrug. ",-1.0
"Landlord finds crossbows, swords in dead tenant’s apartment. A landlord cleaning out a deceased tenant’s apartment in Manhattan this week found a stash of weapons, including crossbows and ninja swords, police sources said. The landlord was inside a   apartment on 215th Street near Seaman Avenue in Inwood around 2:50 p. m.

"Uber refuses to halt self-driving cars. SAN FRANCISCO  —   Uber is riding its   cars into a legal showdown with California regulators. The   company is refusing to obey demands by the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles that it immediately stop  . Hours after Uber launched a   service Wednesday morning with a handful of Volvo luxury SUVs, the DMV sent the company a letter saying the move was illegal because the cars did not have a special permit the department requires for putting autonomous vehicles on public roads. As of Wednesday night, the Volvos  —   distinctive in look with sensors protruding from their tops  —   were still roaming San Francisco’s streets. The company did not respond to a request for comment about the state’s legal threat. “If Uber does not confirm immediately that it will stop its launch and seek a testing permit, DMV will initiate legal action,” DMV Chief Counsel Brian Soublet wrote the company. He referenced the possibility of taking Uber to court. Uber knew about the DMV’s permit requirement but argues that its cars do not meet the state’s definition of an “autonomous vehicle” because they need a person behind the wheel to monitor and intervene if needed. Parsing the definition of an autonomous vehicle is in line with Uber’s history of testing legal boundaries. During its meteoric rise into a multibillion dollar company, Uber has argued with authorities in California and around the world about issues including driver criminal background checks and whether those drivers should be treated as contractors ineligible for employee benefits. As the two sides planned to meet Thursday, both seemed dug into opposing positions. The argument centers around whether the cars  —   tricked out with sensors so they can steer, accelerate and brake, and even decide to change lanes  —   are, legally speaking, “autonomous vehicles. ” The company argues that its cars aren’t covered by the permit requirement, which says an “autonomous vehicle” requires a permit if it can drive itself “without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person. ” According to Anthony Levandowski, the leader of Uber’s   program, Uber’s cars aren’t advanced enough to drive themselves without human monitoring. Therefore, he said, the Volvos are not autonomous  —   and do not require a permit. California has issued permits to 20 companies for tests of autonomous vehicles on public roads, mostly traditional automakers and tech companies. Getting a permit for prototype testing is part of legal language negotiated between the state and industry, and DMV lawyer Soublet argued in an interview that the permit process helps maintain public confidence that the technology is safe. “Don’t start doing this stuff. Apply for the permit. Follow the rules,” Soublet said of Uber. To receive a permit, a company must show proof of insurance, pay a $150 fee and agree that a human driver can take control of the vehicle. Operating without a permit arguably gives Uber a competitive advantage. Companies with one must report to the state all crashes and every instance in which a person takes control during testing. All that information is public. Uber is sending another message to California: Other places want us if you don’t. In a blog post Tuesday, Levandowski warned that “complex rules and requirements could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation” and named several places outside California he characterized as being “pro technology. ” The launch in San Francisco, the city where Uber is headquartered, expanded a deployment of   cars the company started in Pittsburgh in September. The testing lets everyday people experience the cars as Uber works to identify glitches before expanding the technology’s use in San Francisco and elsewhere. The company wouldn’t say the exact number of cars, calling it a “handful. ” The cars have an Uber employee behind the wheel to take over should the technology fail. Users of the app may be matched with a   car but can opt out if they prefer a human driver.   rides cost the same as ordinary ones. Uber’s fleet of Volvo XC90s aren’t the first   cars on San Francisco streets  —   several other companies visit regularly with test prototypes, though none offers public rides. Once testing is complete, the ultimate vision is to sell to the public technology that supporters argue will save thousands of lives because it doesn’t drink, text, fall asleep or take dangerous risks.",1.0
"Balloons. NASA Is Using Balloons to Study Space. Trying to send something to space by attaching it to a balloon and letting go sounds like a plan concocted by a six-year-old.

But it turns out when you're NASA, and your inflated balloon is 1,000 feet up, that pre-school plan graduates into a great platform for stratospheric science. Earlier this week, the US space agency sent a high-pressure balloon skyward from Wanaka, New Zealand, with inflated hopes that it will stay up there and circumnavigate the globe for 100 days or more—a flight time that's about twice the current record.

"NYC’s most prolific 911 caller nabbed by cops. A homeless man has earned the distinction as perhaps the most prolific 911 caller in city history  —   waging a nearly nonstop campaign of harassment that included more than 4, 100 phone calls since December, police sources said. Jeffrey Shankley was finally arrested Wednesday after police found him lingering near Penn Station, one of his favorite spots to send emergency crews on wild goose chases. The    had been arrested 38 times since 1995, including on Nov. 19, 2015 when he allegedly reported a bomb in Penn Station. In that case, the NYPD’s bomb squad searched the building and found nothing, and Shankley got charged with aggravated harassment. His epic calling spree began Dec. 20. Over the next two months, he used his cell phone 4, 178 times to report threats, rant at operators and generally waste valuable time for a 911 call center that dispatches police, fire and ambulance crews to real emergencies citywide. That amounts to 70 calls a day on average. Police in Midtown South made the arrest, then turned him over to cops in Brooklyn, where the call center is headquartered. He was charged with obstructing governmental administration, a misdemeanor.",1.0
"Why People Can’t Stop Talking About Zuckerberg 2020. On January 3, 2017, Mark Zuckerberg posted a status update to his Facebook page. “Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside of my work,” the Facebook CEO wrote to his 84 million followers. “In recent years, I've run 365 miles, built a simple AI for my home, read 25 books and learned Mandarin. My personal challenge for 2017 is to have visited and met people in every state in the US by the end of the year.” He framed the trip as a learning tour amid a “turning point in history,” as technology and globalization has led to “a greater sense of division than I have felt in my lifetime.” Hearing more voices, he wrote, “will help me lead the work at Facebook and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,” his philanthropic LLC. Very quickly, though, the public and the press began to interpret the highly choreographed whistlestop tour as foregrounding a Zuckerberg 2020 presidential campaign. The 33-year-old billionaire hired a former White House photographer, whose images depict him, Obama-like, as a man of the people. A coterie of ex-politicos—including a former aide to Tim Kaine—were helping him orchestrate meet-and-greets. Zuckerberg met with recovering opioid addicts in Ohio. He dropped by the same quaint candy shop in Iowa where Mitt Romney once made milkshakes. He had a quick stint on an assembly line in Detroit. And it didn’t help that, a month before he announced the tour, unsealed court documents revealed Zuckerberg had attempted to restructure Facebook stock to allow him to retain voting control if he served in government for two years, or served indefinitely, with a few stipulations.

"CNN’s town hall showed Clinton at her best — and her worst.   MANCHESTER, N. H.   Wednesday night’s televised town hall with Hillary Clinton featured the candidate at her best  —   and her worst. Clinton and her campaign ought to study the lessons of both.  Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   The candidate at her worst was obvious, and all the more painful for its predictability. When Clinton is pressed on   donations and hefty speaking fees from Wall Street, she reverts to a reflexive defensiveness that hurts her cause. This was on display at the Democratic debate in Des Moines in November, when she invoked the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to explain her flood of Wall Street money.  “I represented New York,” Clinton said. “And I represented New York on   when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy. And it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country. ” If you thought that Clinton would have learned from that blundering answer, it wasn’t on display Wednesday night when CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Clinton about the $675, 000 that Goldman Sachs paid her for three speeches. Cooper: “You were paid $675, 000 for three speeches. Was that a mistake? I mean, was that a bad error in judgment? Clinton: “Look. I made speeches to lots of groups. I told them what I thought. I answered questions. ”  Cooper: “But did you have to be paid $675, 000?” Clinton: “Well, I don’t know. That’s what they offered, so . . . ; you know every secretary of state that I know has done that. ” Cooper: “But . . . they’re not running for an office. ” Clinton: “To be honest, I wasn’t  —   I wasn’t committed to running. I didn’t know whether I would or not. ”  That’s what they offered? For heaven’s sake, Clinton was demanding those   fees. Her       defense just makes her look like yet another former government official who used public service to rake in big bucks on the other side of the revolving door. Her explanation that she took the checks because she “wasn’t committed to running”  —   intimating that she might have behaved differently if she knew voters might hold it against her down the road  —   simply underscores the impression of greediness, opportunism and situational ethics. Yet the evening also featured one of the most   moments I’ve seen on the campaign trail, not only from Clinton but from any politician. It came after a rabbi asked Clinton how she balanced “the ego . . . a person must have to be the leader of the free world” with “the humility to recognize . . . that you can’t be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for. ” Clinton’s response was human, touching and thoughtful. She spoke organically, in an unforced manner, of her faith, the daily scripture lesson she receives by email at 5 a. m. and her attempt to learn, after painful moments in the public eye, how to practice the “discipline of gratitude” under trying circumstances.  “I’m constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States [and] not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve,” Clinton said. “I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another. And I don’t know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, ‘Okay, universe, here I am, watch me roar,’ or ‘Oh, my gosh, I can’t do it, it’s just overwhelming, I have to retreat. ’”  Clinton’s response was also, and I mean this in the best possible way, quintessentially female. She spoke of how her husband was “such a natural politician” and “how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people. ” Imagine Donald Trump, the ultimate   candidate, engaged in that degree of   and  . The exchange was reminiscent of what turned out to be Clinton’s best moment in this state eight years ago, when she became   in answering a voter’s question about what drove her to keep going. This Clinton, thoughtful and even humble, is the candidate that her campaign needs to figure out how to present to voters. The other one, entitled and defensive, isn’t helping her cause.

"Catastrophe, Amazon’s raunchy comedy, is a brilliant depiction of marriage. Star Sharon Horgan breaks down Season 2..  Warning: Spoilers for the entirety of Catastrophe, season two, follow. It’s good, though! Watch it! The opening scene of Catastrophe’s second season  —   which dropped in its entirety on Amazon on April 8  —   is all it takes to remember that this show isn’t telling the same marriage story you’ve heard so many times before.    ”Don’t touch me,” Sharon, curled up in bed around her enormous,    stomach, snarls at her husband. ”If you touch me, I’m gonna scream,” Rob spits at her, furious. Two seconds later, they’re laughing. Five seconds later, they’re fucking. Catastrophe  —   created by and starring comedians Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney  —   is a filthy, painfully honest weirdo of a show.    First broadcast on UK network Channel 4, the series began with Sharon and Rob having a wild week of random sex while he was on a business trip to London, and came crashing back down to earth once Sharon learned she was pregnant. The two don’t know each other, but this might be their last shot to have a kid, so they decide to just give it a go and see what happens.    Catastrophe delves into pregnancy, sex, and marriage without retreading any of the usual clichés. In fact, when I asked Horgan recently which stereotypes they were trying to avoid, she just laughed. The answer was obvious: ”All of them.” With the goal of making something actually relatable for parents who just might be less than perfect, the second season ditches pregnancy drama and dives straight into what it’s like to try to make a family work.    I caught up with Horgan about Catastrophe’s excellent, surprising second season, so she could break down some of its more shocking developments. 1) Season two jumps forward in time  —   like, a lot The first season ended on a cliffhanger  —   Sharon’s water breaking months early  —   so it was natural to assume the second would pick up almost immediately afterward. Instead, that opening scene doesn’t end with Rob asking Sharon to put ”a finger in his asshole”; it ends with their toddler son running into the room and ruining the moment entirely.    As it turns out, the second season of Catastrophe isn’t actually about a couple raising their first kid. They already have one, and then, almost immediately, another. As Horgan tells it, she and Delaney were never going to tell that story, precisely because it’s been done so many times before. ”We just weren’t interested,” she said. ”We didn’t want to show a baby pissing in their eye if they couldn’t get the nappy on, you know?” And getting to surprise people just when they think they know what’s up is fun. Or in Horgan’s words: ”We kind of just wanted to fuck with people.” In fact, skipping ahead to Rob and Sharon having two kids and being fully entrenched in family life was always the plan. The two even originally had the time jump set for the end of the very first episode, so Catastrophe could skip Sharon’s pregnancies entirely, but network feedback encouraged them to slow it down. ”They said they really liked getting to know [Sharon and Rob],” said Horgan, ”and them getting to know each other.” Once they thought about telling the story of Sharon’s first pregnancy in more detail, Horgan and Delaney realized they could tell a very different story from most pregnancies on television. Staring 40 in the face, Sharon had a pregnancy fraught with health problems that didn’t exactly seem    —   yet in Delaney and Horgan’s hands, those problems absolutely were. And in season two, the pair were even more committed to going to darker places than some might expect from a raunchy, rollicking comedy. 2) Sharon and Rob are finally happy together. That doesn’t make their marriage any less excruciating.             If there’s one expected story about marriage that Catastrophe actually indulges, it’s the idea that couples with kids have less sex. That, at least, felt real to the series’ creators.    If Sharon and Rob had as much sex now that they have two kids as they did back when they had no kids  —   or if that sex was as good as it had been in season one  —   Horgan and Delaney knew it wouldn’t feel right. Says Horgan: ”We didn’t want couples with young kids watching it and going, ’Oh, fuck off. ’” In one episode, they manage to escape for a weekend to Paris but end up having a terrible time. ”In the 12 years I’ve had kids, I’ve had three weekends away,” said Horgan. ”And it was miserable every time. There’s so much pressure when you don’t have your kids with you to be romantic.” Case in point: Sharon breaking a rib by falling off the bed during the Paris trip was, in fact, inspired by one of Horgan’s own disastrous ”romantic” weekends away. But not being able to physically connect like the couple used to ripples out even further than Paris. In the second season, Catastrophe lets Sharon and Rob entertain fantasies of sleeping with other people  —   and it very nearly rips them apart. Rob gets in too deep with an office flirtation, to the point where he gets fired. ”I think he would’ve been happy with a rather intense flirt,” Horgan said, ”but even when you don’t have intentions of going through with something, it can still backfire in a catastrophic way.” Fittingly, Sharon also gets too drunk and friendly with a   dude after a huge fight with Rob  —   and then the next day, she can’t remember whether or not she went ahead and actually cheated.    Sharon and Rob still find each other attractive, but they are also exhausted, which makes them feel less desirable. And so for them, and for many tired married couples, indulging in the idea that someone young and hot might like them isn’t about necessarily wanting to cheat. ”We wanted to tell those stories,” Horgan said. ”It’s all about people making them feel attractive.” 3) Rob and Sharon both have personal crises that get much darker than you might expect In the words of Bridget Jones: ”It is a truth universally acknowledged that when one part of your life starts going okay, another falls spectacularly to pieces.” Having a new house and a family doesn’t make Sharon and Rob’s problems disappear. If anything, they just get far more complicated  —   and that much harder to shake. After the scare with Frankie, their first son, Sharon finds to her horror that she can’t connect with her new daughter. ”You don’t think she’s . .. manipulative?” she asks Rob afterward, trying to sell it as a joke but obviously failing. Then, lest we think this might be a casually   line, the second episode opens with Sharon seeing a psychologist and trying to get some pills. She’s lost, she’s lonely, she’s embarrassed, and she has no idea how to fix it. Even worse: Learning to love her daughter doesn’t make that feeling go away.    ”People really responded to the real stuff in the first season,” Horgan said of Sharon’s pregnancy troubles in the first season. ”Depicting postpartum depression was another way to not just tell a more meaningful story, but to tell people that really, truly, it’s going to be okay.” Rob also has a rough go of it this season, thanks to increasingly feeling useless and getting fired from his job. By the end of the season he goes back on years of sobriety, raids a hotel mini fridge, and falls off the wagon and flat onto his face. Horgan told me that she and Delaney  —   who is sober offscreen as well as on  —   never intended to get into Rob’s alcoholism in a real way. ”We were interested in the idea that [sobriety] was just a part of his life, his persona,” she said. But as they were writing the season, they realized that it made sense that Rob would react to all the chaos in his life by turning to alcohol. ”It’s so dark,” Horgan said, ”and also, I’m sorry, a little funny.” She tried to stop herself but let out a big laugh, anyway. ”I’m sorry. I shouldn’t be laughing.” ”But comedy’s really good for that,” she continued. You can be going through something so awful and still, with some   ”gallows humor,” find a way out. Seasons one and two of Catastrophe are currently available to stream on Amazon.    ",-1.0
"The Satanic Temple Is No Laughing Matter. 

Slide:  1 / of  1.
Caption: 
Magnolia Pictures  Because The Satanic Temple doesn’t believe in a literal Satan, or in anything supernatural, it’s often presented in the media as a joke religion like the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the Church of the SubGenius. But Penny Lane, director of the new documentary Hail Satan?, says that’s a total misconception. “The Satanic Temple would very much like for people to, perhaps, learn to judge other people based on their actions, not based on what they look like or what you might have heard about them on daytime television,” Lane says in Episode 361 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. The group is best known for its activism on the issue of separation of church and state. One scene in the film shows the Temple’s spokesperson, Lucien Greaves, strapping on a bulletproof vest before appearing beside the group’s controversial statue of Baphomet. Lane says that sort of risk-taking demonstrates real devotion. “It’s not an either/or proposition,” she says. “Yes, they are internet trolls and pranksters, and they really are Satanists. Both of those things are true. Because the core of Satanism is to embrace joking and pranking and being mischievous and freaking people out. That’s the heart of the religious identity. It’s not evidence that they’re insincere. It’s actually part of it.” Lane also says it’s not unusual for religious movements to have humble beginnings. “Probably many of the religions that we now take for granted as being ‘real’ started out with cons or press conferences or lying or magic tricks,” she says. “It’s good marketing. But then once you get there, what do the ideas have to offer? People don’t stick around for Satanism just because it’s funny. People stick around because—for a person who is a Satanist—Satanism brings them a great deal of meaning and value.” And just as the Satanic Temple uses humor to communicate a serious message, Lane hopes that her documentary does the same. “It’s really something to behold when you see these crowds walking out of a theater with these gigantic smiles on their faces,” she says, “because they’ve obviously had this fun experience that’s given them joy and uplift and inspiration. But there’s also kind of this strange look on their face—of concern—because they’re really trying to figure out if they’re a Satanist or not, and they’ve never had to ask that question before.” Listen to the complete interview with Penny Lane in Episode 361 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. Penny Lane on Ten Commandments monuments: “The monuments were created to look like the stone tablets that are carried down by Charlton Heston in the Cecil B. DeMille film The Ten Commandments. It’s a particular design that was made by a civic group in the 1950s, but the promotion and spread and creation of those monuments was funded and supported in part by Paramount pictures as kind of a tie-in with their film … It’s really reminiscent of other monument battles, like with the Confederate monument battles as well, where it seems like these are from a really old time in American history that we should preserve, but often you see that they’re quite new, and they don’t have the cultural heritage and history behind them that we’re told they have.” Penny Lane on the Satanic Panic: “Let’s say you’re a high school teacher in a small town, and someone comes up with these crazy accusations that you’re part of a Satanic cult and you’ve been raping children after school or something. In most cases what would happen is that person would just leave town. They would quit their job—or get fired—and no charges were filed, but they have had their life fairly well disrupted or ruined, and their reputation disrupted or ruined as well. There are countless stories like that that we’ll never really know the numbers on, because we don’t have court records or something to refer to. So the nature of the problem was actually so extensive that it’s hard to even measure the impact of it.” Penny Lane on free speech: “There are all kinds of people, on all sides of all political and cultural divides, that don’t understand what the First Amendment is actually for. And this idea of being offended—the idea that someone would say something that upsets you, and your desire to want to shut that down—is quite natural. We all experience the feeling of it. You just want to be like, ‘Hey shut up, that’s awful. That hurts my feelings. That goes against what I was taught in school or taught in church.’ But the reality of it is that the First Amendment is there to protect precisely that kind of speech, because you don’t need some kind of law to protect the speech of people who are popular and saying popular things.” Penny Lane on the statue of Baphomet: “The meaning of these symbols and ideas and mythologies and images can change very rapidly. So it’s not a crazy idea to think that in a hundred years the Baphomet monument—that the Satanic Temple made as part of their Ten Commandments campaign—that someone could look at that monument and instantly know that the meaning of that monument is not death and torture and destruction and worshiping the devil, but in fact the meaning of that monument is religious pluralism, the importance of embracing blasphemy, and standing up for what is just in the face of extreme opposition.

"Sweden truck attack: what we know so far.  On Friday, a truck drove into people in the busiest street in the center of Stockholm, Sweden, killing at least four people and injuring a dozen others. Here’s what we know so far.       What we know  Just before 3 pm local time on Friday, a beer truck reportedly rammed through Stockholm’s busiest shopping street and then into the Ahlens department store in the center of the city. At least four people were killed and a dozen others were injured, according to police.              A masked man reportedly highjacked the truck while the driver was unloading the vehicle. He then drove the truck into a crowd. Shortly after the attack, police told residents to stay home and avoid the area. Police arrested someone in connection to the attack. It’s not clear if he’s the person who drove the truck into the crowd.  Earlier, police released a picture of a person of interest. “Many things point to this being a terror attack,” Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven told reporters. The Sweden incident follows other similar vehicle attacks in London, Berlin, and Nice, France.  What we don’t know  Who carried out the attack Whether more than one person was involved in the attack  ",-1.0
"Donald Trump’s tax plan makes impossible promises. This cartoon explains..  During the primaries, Donald Trump had a tax proposal that was wildly irresponsible. It included massive tax cuts, without much of a plan to spend less.    Now that he’s one step closer to actually having to do the job, he has honed a slightly more realistic plan. But that’s like saying a flying unicorn is impossible so you’ll settle for a regular unicorn. We expect conservative nominees to propose tax cuts and spending cuts, and those two things are usually somewhat proportional. But even the revision of Trump’s plan is not really feasible, unless he wants to balloon the national debt by $5. 3 trillion. To be clear, Hillary Clinton’s plan would also add to the national debt  —   but only by $200 billion, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.     To put these dollar values in perspective, we decided to do a thought experiment: If we forced the candidates to balance their budgets, what government programs would they need to cut? A quick preview: We won’t be able to just trim government programs to get Trump back to even; we’re going to have to get rid of entire government agencies.    Clinton would add $200 billion to the debt. Trump would add $5. 3 trillion. In the cartoon below, let’s say that being at ground level is where we are now: paying for government expenses that currently exist, while adding additional expenses to the national debt. That’s President Barack Obama:         But Clinton and Trump want the federal government to spend a different amount than we currently do  —   and collect a different amount from taxpayers.         Over the next 10 years, Trump wants save money by spending $1. 2 trillion less than we are spending with Obama.    Hillary Clinton wants to spend $1. 65 trillion more, which puts her in the proverbial hole.         But in that period, Trump wants to collect $5. 8 trillion less in taxes, which means federal revenue would fall into a deep hole.    Clinton wants to collect $1. 5 trillion more, which would almost get her to a balanced budget.         Once we add in interest, Trump would be $5. 3 trillion in the hole and Clinton would be $200 billion in the hole.         Let’s do an experiment! Let’s help them balance their budgets by cutting government programs. The Congressional Budget Office puts out a list of potential government program cuts, which calculates how much money each option would save over 10 years. So let’s try to get these candidates to ground level. What if we:  Severely reduce Pell Grant funding, which helps poor students afford college ($140. 5 billion) Don’t purchase nearly 2, 500 fancy fighter jet planes that are being newly developed (  Joint Strike Fighters) and instead purchase planes already in production ($31. 4 billion) Stop building new aircraft carriers ($11. 8 billion) Cut down on the number of ballistic missile submarines in operation ($14. 9 billion)          That gets Clinton to ground level, but it barely gets Trump closer to the surface. Let’s try a few bigger cuts for Trump:  Stop human space exploration ($76. 9 billion) Reduce funding for highways ($82 billion) Get rid of subsidies for Amtrak ($13. 5 billion) Reduce international affairs programs  —   diplomatic, consular, and global   among others  —   by 25 percent ($109 billion) Eliminate all subsidized loans for undergraduates ($38. 6 billion)  Raise the retirement age for Social Security. The younger you are, the more it would go up. For those born in 1977 or later, the new retirement age would be 70 ($34. 8 billion). Reduce Social Security benefits by 15 percent for people newly eligible for them ($204 billion)          These are huge cuts that would virtually cripple entire agencies and shut down entire programs. But even that wouldn’t help Trump get to ground level. This isn’t working. Let’s try another method.  Let’s start over for Trump, back at being $5. 3 trillion in the hole  …             And let’s cut entire agencies instead of making realistic cuts.          Let’s cut all funding for transportation  —   for highways, mass transit, and aviation, among other things  —   which would save about $1 trillion for the next 10 years.    And let’s cut funding for veterans, which pays for things like their health care, compensation, pension, education, and housing. That saves about $800 billion. Let’s also eliminate US consulates, embassies, military assistance to allies, aid to developing nations, and international peacekeeping efforts. That saves about $650 billion.         That only gets Trump halfway out the hole.  Let’s eliminate environmental protection programs, which would save about $400 billion over the next 10 years. And let’s cut all federal justice programs  —   like the FBI, federal courts, drug and firearm enforcement, and federal prisons. That would save about $600 billion.    Let’s also cut all of NASA, the National Science Foundation, and all other science, space, and technology programs. That saved $350 billion.         Nope, still not there. Let’s cut all income security programs, like food stamps and benefits to retirees. That would save $737 billion. Let’s cut all funding that allows the executive and legislative branches to function. That will save about $200 billion. And let’s cut all about half of the federal funding for education, social services, and the arts. That’ll save about $500 billion.         Now, finally, Trump is back at ground level  —   after having cut all funding to crucial government programs that make the country function properly:         The kicker: Trump claims he will lower the debt This was an absurd thought exercise, largely because Trump’s tax and spending proposal are not even close to adding up.     The US could technically adopt Trump’s plan and add the additional costs to the national debt. But that would balloon the debt to $28. 4 trillion in 10 years, which projects out to 105 percent of GDP.         Oh, and here’s the kicker: Trump has specifically said that he will lower the national debt  —   by negotiating it down.  So if he doesn’t propose adding to the debt, and he’s not going to cut additional spending, where does the money come from? The chart below summarized both candidates’ tax plans, and it shows that Trump can’t stick by his tax plan and lower debt.         With this logic, if Trump were a kid who owned a lemonade stand, he would slash prices, buy slightly worse lemonade, and somehow make more money than before to pay back his dad for giving him the wood to build the stand. Maybe to Trump, these promises are “all words” and “sound bites. ” But these promises also include numbers, and all the talking in the world won’t make these numbers add up.          ",-1.0
"How Brett Favre indirectly brought Geno Smith to Giants. If you look at Geno Smith these days, he doesn’t look like the same guy who played for the Jets. Sure, the face is the same. But he’s wrapped in blue and red now, happy for a fresh start with the Giants and a chance to get better as a quarterback. “There were other teams that were interested, and there were other opportunities that might have gotten me more money, but I didn’t see those as the types of organizations I saw myself in,” Smith told The Post. “I thought this was the organization for me, and that’s why I chose here. ” Smith joining the Giants might be a   to some. You figure he wouldn’t want any part of New York after four seasons with the Jets, with whom he was often roasted by fans and sports media for his performances. Much of it was warranted. He was   as a starter for the Jets with 16 of those starts coming during his rookie season, when he was forced to play after a preseason injury to Mark Sanchez. After going   as a rookie, he went   the following year and saw Rex Ryan get replaced by Todd Bowles. Smith lost his starting job to Ryan Fitzpatrick before the 2015 season, when he suffered a broken jaw during a   altercation during training camp. When Fitzpatrick was benched in 2016, Smith got to start an October game against the Ravens  —   but suffered a   knee injury in the second quarter of a Jets   victory. For his career, Smith has thrown 28 touchdowns passes and 36 interceptions, putting his quarterback rating at 72. 4. Yes, he has heard the critics, but insists he isn’t listening. That’s why he’s staying in New York. “People can say all kinds of stuff, but I never really paid attention to it,” he said. “I think it’s hard for people to believe that. How can you not pay attention to it in New York? But this is my life. I’m a football player, and that’s all I really care about. ” The word is coach Ben McAdoo was impressed with Smith’s football IQ when they met in the spring. The feeling was mutual. There are two reasons Smith signed with the Giants: Eli Manning and McAdoo. Actually, there’s a third reason: Brett Favre. “Brett Favre is probably my favorite quarterback of all time,” Smith said. “To have a coach who coached him and saw his talents live was something I wanted. I’ve got a bunch of film on Favre in my iPad. I watch him all the time. We run pretty much similar plays here. ” But his biggest reason for joining the Giants was Manning. Smith had to learn on the job while with the Jets with no real mentor to follow. He was always in tense competitions with Sanchez or Fitzpatrick. There is no question who leads the Giants. The quarterback room also includes rookie Davis Webb and   Josh Johnson. “When I got to the Jets, I didn’t have a mentor or anybody who could show me the ropes,” Smith said. “So to have that with Eli here and have an opportunity to continue to compete and get better and be on a winning team, I’m totally fine with that. ” Smith had his surgically repaired knee checked out this week and was given clearance to increase his workload. He knows the preseason might be his only chance to put something positive on film. He signed a   contract that will earn him from $1. 2 million to $2 million. Giants fans now have to get comfortable with Smith being one snap away from being their starter. “It’s all about production, especially when you get into this league,” he said. “I know I’ll get a chance during the preseason and throughout camp. Every day on the practice field is a chance to show I’m better with anticipation, understanding defenses and making reads. I’m always trying to get better. ”",1.0
"This Buddhist temple in China takes care of the elderly.         Buddhist monk Dao Yuan, 51, bangs a drum to summon residents for morning prayers. (Kevin   Images)  The Ji Xiang Buddhist Temple’s nursing home was started by an elderly monk in 2000 to provide care for seniors who have no family to care for them. It survives on the generosity of local villagers who bring food, and on government funding that helps maintain the home and provide basic medical care for the residents.

"Hacker threatens to release stolen copies of ‘Orange is the New Black’. SAN FRANCISCO  —   A hacker claims to have stolen the upcoming season of Netflix’s hit series “Orange Is The New Black,” and is demanding that the video streaming service pay an unspecified ransom to prevent all the new episodes from being prematurely released online. The hacker, operating under the name The Dark Overlord, has already purportedly uploaded the first episode to an illegal   service. The Associated Press could not legally confirm the authenticity of that uploaded file. New episodes of “Orange” are scheduled for official release on June 9. Netflix said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios had suffered a breach. The Los Gatos, California, company described it as an “active situation” that’s being investigated by the FBI and other authorities. Pirated copies of “Orange” could dent Netflix’s subscriber growth and the company’s stock price. In the ransom note, The Dark Overlord claimed to have stolen series from other studios, too, by breaking into a single company. The purported hacker promised to also release those titles unless “modest” ransoms are paid. Rumors of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of the footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency. When the AP contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the purloined video wouldn’t be made publicly available after all, making the   claim that “no one really (cares) about unreleased movies and TV show episodes. ” It’s not clear what triggered The Dark Overload’s renewed ransom demands. Netflix is counting on “Orange” to help it add 3. 2 million subscribers from April through June. That’s substantially higher than the company’s average gain of 1. 8 million subscribers in the same period over the past five years. Whenever Netflix’s quarterly subscriber gains fall shy of management’s projections, the company’s stock usually plunges.",1.0

This year, it s the Republican presidential candidate who says the United States isn t great anymore and the Democrat who insists it is. The Republican says that the former KGB agent presiding over Russia is a better leader than the president of the United States. The Democrat condemns him for it.

"Why Bitcoin lost 15 percent of its value in a few minutes.  The value of bitcoins plunged more than 15 percent on Friday afternoon after the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application to create the first   fund (ETF) for Bitcoin. The proposal would have made it easier for ordinary investors to buy bitcoins, but the SEC is worried that these investors could be cheated in the largely unregulated Bitcoin marketplace.    The ruling has been closely watched in the Bitcoin world. A favorable ruling would have given the cryptocurrency a stamp of approval from an influential regulator, and it also could have sparked a surge in Bitcoin’s price as it provided an easier way for people to invest in this exotic new asset class. An ETF provides a way for people to buy an asset or a group of assets as if it were a single stock. There are ETFs that let people invest in gold, wheat, and every stock in the S&P 500. Right now, investing in Bitcoin is a cumbersome process that creates the risk of having your wealth stolen by hackers. A Bitcoin ETF could simplify the process, allowing anyone to invest in Bitcoin using an ordinary brokerage account. The proposed Bitcoin ETF was the brainchild of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who once sued Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea behind Facebook from them when they were all students at Harvard. After settling that lawsuit for millions of dollars worth of Facebook stock, the brothers began investing in Bitcoin startups. They announced plans to create a Bitcoin ETF in 2013, and their proposal has been working its way through the SEC ever since.    But the SEC wasn’t impressed with the proposal. The law requires the SEC to make sure that a newly traded asset existed in a   market that adequately protects people from manipulation and fraud. But the SEC saw little evidence that these conditions were met. Bitcoin is primarily traded in unregulated markets located overseas, especially in China, and as a result, the price of bitcoins is extremely volatile. In the SEC’s view, Bitcoin exchanges are not yet mature enough to justify opening them to the general public. “This creates a    problem,” says Jerry Brito of the   Coin Center. “How do we develop   and regulated markets in the US and Europe if financial innovators aren’t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?” The ruling hammered bitcoin’s value. In the minutes after it was published, the value of one bitcoin fell from $1, 290 to less than $1, 000. As I write this, it’s back up to $1, 100, about 15 percent below its value before the ruling was announced:            Analysts expected that SEC approval for the Winklevoss proposal would send Bitcoin’s price soaring, as millions of ordinary investors suddenly had an easy way to buy into the Bitcoin market. That expected rise was likely priced into Bitcoin’s price ahead of the SEC ruling, which would explain why a negative ruling led to a plunging value for the cryptocurrency.    Even after the latest turmoil, however, Bitcoin’s value is way above its level in the past couple of years. A year ago, you could buy one Bitcoin for only about $400. Now it’s almost three times that value. ",-1.0
"New twist in D.C. death of a former Putin aide fuels Moscow conspiracy theories.      MOSCOW  —   A former senior Kremlin aide died in a Washington hotel from blunt force trauma wounds  —   and now Moscow is filled with conspiracy theories about who might have wanted him dead. The November death of Mikhail Lesin, initially reported by his family as a heart attack, immediately generated skepticism from Kremlin critics. In a world in which   agents are poisoned in London by radioactive tea and the lawyers of Kremlin critics die in Moscow prisons, the death of Lesin, 57, at a   Dupont Circle hotel was bound to raise eyebrows. Now the revelation from the D. C. Medical Examiner’s Office that Lesin had suffered a blow to the head, and also had extensive trauma wounds elsewhere on his body, has snapped attention back to the case. Some opposition journalists  —   many of whom knew Lesin since the waning years of the Soviet Union  —   said he had been killed because he knew too much about the inner workings of the Kremlin. Others head in even more    directions: suggesting he may not be dead at all, and could be helping U. S. investigators understand Russia. (That possibility would suggest that the Metropolitan Police Department and the FBI operate like their Russian counterparts. There’s no evidence that’s the case.) Many reporters questioned why Lesin    who had property holdings totaling many millions of dollars    would have been in Washington at all, let alone at a   hotel where rooms run $190 a night. “Wow. This man had a very interesting life, and it sounds like a very interesting death, too,” wrote Ilya Krasilshik, a reporter for Meduza, a media outlet that is frequently critical of the Kremlin. Lesin played a central role in the evolution of Russia’s modern media scene into an instrument of Kremlin influence and control. Trained as an engineer, he helped found one of Russia’s first ad agencies, then moved into state television under President Boris Yeltsin. After Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Lesin took over the unruly   NTV channel and reversed its orientation. He was a longtime confidante and PR adviser to Putin, and helped shape Putin’s domestic image as a virile, uncorrupt leader. To bolster Russia’s image abroad, and to propagate the Kremlin’s   worldview to a broader audience, he helped foster the creation of Russia Today, an   television network that has spread around the world since its start in 2005. More recently, he had stepped down from his post as the head of   a holding company that owns several prominent   TV networks and the and the popular Ekho Moskvy radio station. The break came after clashing with the station’s editor, Alexey Venediktov, about whether to fire a journalist who had criticized the Kremlin.    The Dupont Circle Hotel, where Lesin was found dead in November 2015. (Andrew  )  That brush with the FBI fueled Russian speculation that his death was an elaborate fake. ”This story with Lesin is very strange,” wrote Oleg Kozyrev, an opposition blogger, on Twitter. “It looks more and more like a program of witness protection. Maybe he is alive and is giving FBI some important evidence. ” Others were simply puzzled that the news that he died from blunt force trauma would take so long to become public. “I don’t understand about Lesin,” wrote Alexander Plyushev, the reporter at the Ekho Moskvy radio station who Lesin had wanted to fire. “If the death was caused by ‘blunt force trauma,’ why did it take so long to determine it?” As has happened before with the sudden deaths of people enmeshed with the Kremlin, for now, the circumstances remain deeply murky. “Nothing is clear except for the fact that the cause of his death was not natural,” said an editor at the Russian business daily Kommersant, Dmitry Spiridonov “Well, this is at least something, but still nothing is clear.”",-0.5
"How Planet Earth II filmed its thrilling ""Snake Island"" chase scene.  When the gorgeous Planet Earth II premiered in the UK in November, one clip in particular turned heads. As it begins, a baby iguana, newly hatched from an egg buried in sand, tentatively pokes its head out above the surface  —   and then launches itself into one of the most thrilling chase sequences ever to grace television, courtesy of the iguana’s desire to live and a truly terrifying army of snakes.     The drama of “Snake Island”  —   as the Vox Culture team calls it  —   would not be denied. The clip raced around the internet quicker than the baby iguana fleeing certain peril, proving the power of combining    stakes with keen filmmaking and a tight edit.  To get more insight into the making of Planet Earth II, and the “Snake Island” sequence in particular, I spoke with series executive producer Mike Gunton and director Elizabeth White. The short version? Nature is pretty thrilling (and unforgiving) all on its own, but they’ve honed some techniques to better capture it anyway. The following interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.    Caroline Framke  So many of Planet Earth II’s scenes are shot and edited like sequences from an action movie. When you were filming, were you looking for that specific type of footage?     Mike Gunton  Obviously you have to work hard, and there’s a lot of craft in it, but actually, there’s so much natural drama in these things that they do drive . .. they cry out to be presented in that way. You’re not turning a mundane piece of nothingness into something. They’re there.  The skill is in picking the best moments and making it work technically. Unfortunately, animals don’t hit their marks or read scripts or [respond to] “Action!” So a lot of it is what you manage to capture, but we always go with very clear ideas about the sorts of stories we want to tell and the parameters with which that story should be told. So we’re putting cameras in positions where we’ll get those sorts of images. Sometimes on this series we’ve actually had two cameras on one location, and that massively improves or helps your flexibility. . .. It’s almost like a studio shoot, where you can go, “Okay, cut to camera one!” That has helped.    I think also the style that we’ve used with Planet Earth II, it’s very fluid, very dynamic camerawork. We’ve taken the camera off the tripod through these miniaturizations of    mounts. We did a bit of that on some of our previous series, but now you almost think to yourself, “How the hell did we do anything in the past without these cameras?” Because now actually every shot is done like this. Caroline Framke So for a scene like the one my   and I have dubbed “Snake Island”  —   our favorite movie of the year  —   I’d love to hear more about how something like that was shot. Was it as dramatic when you were shooting it as it became after editing? It sounds like most of these scenarios are.   Elizabeth White Oh, yeah, a massive adrenaline rush. My worst ever role as director, because I spent most of the time covering my eyes going, “Did it get away? !”    The whole sequence is actually like eight minutes long, and we do show some [iguanas] that get away and some that don’t. Also, we very much have tried to mention in it that for the snakes, this is a brutal place to live. For the snakes, it’s their only really big feeding opportunity of the year.  So for that sequence, we wanted to tell that whole story. A nest of iguanas is  —   between four and six come out at any time, and so you do see successful ones and you do see ones that fail.  Mike Gunton  It’s not all carnage. Elizabeth White  No, it’s not all carnage. [But] it is pretty brutal, and I think the big challenge on that sequence was that we obviously need to show the drama, because it’s obviously a massive adrenaline rush to be there and to film it, because you don’t know where those little iguanas are going to come up.  It starts with a hatchling pulling its head out of the sand, and that’s its opening moments of life. And we’re standing at the top of the beach with a pair of binoculars seeing this tiny little head, and it’s looking around and kind of going, “Oh, shit. ” Mike Gunton  And we know it’s “Oh, shit” more than he even does!            Elizabeth White It’s really interesting with the iguanas. Some of them are really cocky, and they just kind of come out, and the little things just walk down the beach like, “Isn’t this really nice? We’re having such a nice day. ” And one of the first we actually watched properly emerge  —   and in fact, the first we saw that revealed to us where we wanted to film the story  —   he properly freaked out and ran toward the rocks. And of course the problem is that then the snakes see them.     So as it kind of slowed down and panicked, running at the rocks, this sort of Medusa’s head of snakes came out of the wall.  We’d been there a couple of days at that point, and we’d been all around this whole peninsula looking for where we were going to get hatchlings. We were looking for hawks and frigate birds as well as snakes; we were looking for all the different things that prey on hatchlings. And then when we saw that, we called it “the Wall of Death. ” You have to be quite careful  —   you can’t walk across the beach because of hatchlings. We were working with a ranger who tells us where we can and can’t go. So we walked down to that wall, and literally a single crack had between eight and 12 snakes in it. That density of snakes [is] why we started to focus on that area of the beach. All the iguanas coming from that sand had to pass that way to get down to the colony, and the snakes know that. They’re smart. They’re there, homed in, watching the beach. That’s how we managed to get that amazing footage. And it’s not pack hunting. Those snakes are absolutely each and every one out for itself. Caroline Framke  Huh! That’s interesting, because it really looks like the snakes are teaming up to cut the iguana off. Elizabeth White Yeah, no. And you really notice that when one of them does catch it, they’re just ambushing. Some of them are in the wall  —   they’re higher up, they’ve got a better view of the beach  —   and the other ones are tucked down behind rocks and very much lying in ambush. But if one of them sees a movement and moves, that’s when they all kind of go, [gasp! ].    Mike Gunton That’s why you get that very sinister sense that they’re all in it together, but in fact, they’re all watching each other to see if anyone picks up first. [Elizabeth has] a theory that when they start, what the snakes are doing is getting into it, so when they first emerge, probably more [iguanas] get away then. But then the snakes start to clock that the iguanas are coming, they start to get homed in on it. So when you were there, it was all craziness. The other thing to remember, of course, is that we shoot this in slow motion. So that whole event, when you were there  —   Elizabeth White   It happened so quickly.  Mike Gunton If you didn’t [shoot it in slow motion] you wouldn’t see anything. It would just be impossible to enjoy, but also you wouldn’t get the revelation. Slow motion allows you to see all the different strategies.  Elizabeth White And some things you don’t see at the time. There’s one particular shot . .. the snake actually comes and tries to bite the little one, and its face hits the rock and it gets pushed backward. You would’ve never seen that happen at the time. It’s only because we shot off speed, and then you look at it in slow motion through this lens and you’re like, “Wow. ” That snake so nearly got that iguana and hit the rock instead.  Mike Gunton That’s why the photographers are so extraordinary. They’re having to go almost with instinct. You can’t really make conscious decisions about what you’re doing.              Elizabeth White There were two cameras [filming the “Snake Island” sequence] one of which had a very long lens. The cameraman’s got a tripod, and he’s got this incredible zoom, but he’s actually quite a long way away. He just needs a nice clear view through to where the action of the iguana is. He can zoom in; that’s his trick.     The other cameraman we had with a   system, so he was shooting wider  —   you can’t be so stable with a long lens  —   but he was able to move around much more easily. When you’ve got a tripod, especially on sand, it’s hard to balance it.  Mike Gunton So he’s the one tracking with the animals. That shot you see when the iguana first comes out, you’re tracking along, and then under the camera come those snakes; that’s shot on [the second] camera. Then all the details of the little looks, that’s shot on  —    Elizabeth White The long lens. Mike Gunton And by having two cameras, it allowed us to get the snakes’ perspective and the iguana’s perspective, all in one event. Normally you wouldn’t be able to do that; you’d have to piece it together. “To be in the animals’ world, you have to be on their eye level” Elizabeth White A lot of people have thought the tracking shots were done by drone. But actually, virtually all the sequences shot on the animals’ level are done on a handheld unit. That was a real buzzword for us with this whole approach to the series: To be in the animals’ world, you have to be on their eye level. Otherwise, you feel kind of distinct or detached. So for that cameraman with the tripod, that meant trying to get the tripod into the sand and get it as low as possible, and certainly for the handheld stuff it was about getting down as much as possible. But then the moment you lift up with a handheld device and you’re at human eye level, it looks like an aerial shot.  And that was great for us, because you can’t fly drones in the Galapagos. But someone said to me earlier, “Oh, man, how did you fly the drone? !” and I was like, “No . .. ”    It’s an amazing tool, to be able to use these smaller cameras and a stable system that’s handheld.  Mike Gunton By taking it a lot farther away, you’re actually flattening the angle. On a tripod it’s quite hard to be at snake eye level, but if you’re 40 meters away, the angle effectively becomes so flat it appears that you’re at that level.  Caroline Framke Well, I just want to watch this clip again now. And I’ve already seen it so many times.  Mike Gunton [laughs] I reckon it’s going to be one of those clips film schools will analyze. Caroline Framke After watching such dramatic events, can you emotionally divorce yourself from what’s happening with the animals? Elizabeth White It can be hard, especially when you’re spending a lot of time [with them]. For me particularly, the penguin chicks . .. you can see nice happy, healthy penguin chicks with these big bellies, and they look so content, and then you see a little penguin chick that’s almost like a tripod with its beak down to the ground; it’s just hollow.    And there’s a little part of you that wishes you could go down there and take all the little orphan ones and look after them. But we’re all biologists by background, and we know the reality is a lot of animals will not make it, and you can’t interfere.

"The border wall proposal Mexico’s president might actually support.  When Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pays a spontaneous visit to Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday, they’re going to have a hard time avoiding the elephant in the room: Trump’s famous proposal to ”build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.”    Perhaps, though, Peña Nieto might come to the meeting armed with a counterproposal: one that Mexican Twitter users have been suggesting for ages. It would even allow Donald Trump to make his planned immigration speech in Phoenix Wednesday night without having to go through customs first.  APOYEMOS A DONALD TRUMP. SI AL MURO FRONTERIZO pic. twitter.   —   sixto jesús (@sixtodlp) August 20, 2015       The text reads (translated figuratively): WE SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP: YES TO THE BORDER WALL    WE’LL HAPPILY SEND YOU THE PLANS, AND DON’T WORRY, MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT. WHEN WILL THE   EVICTIONS START?    The point, of course (to belabor the joke) is that the   border that Donald Trump and others treat as inviolable has actually shifted substantially over time  —   and the very places where Americans today are most liable to imagine an ”invasion” of immigrants in fact belonged to Mexico long before they ever belonged to America.    Back when Americans were invading Mexico Because the meme goes all the way back to when Mexico was still a colony of Spain, though, it actually misses the point when Mexico really could have used a wall. This is what the   border looked like in 1826, a few years after Mexico won its independence from Spain:             You’ll notice that ”New Mexico” is still part of original Mexico. So are Arizona, California, and, crucially, Texas.    You might recall the story of how Texas joined the US from history class, depending on how willing your teacher was to let historical Americans look like jerks. But think about it from the perspective of ”border security” as we know it today, and it’s literally the mirror image of everything the most paranoid white Americans fear about Latino immigrants. When this map was drawn, Texas (which, again, was part of Mexico at this time) was being invaded by a wave of immigrants from the US. These immigrants brought their foreign cultural values with them, including the ownership of slaves. And they didn’t respect the rule of law: When Mexico tried to ban slavery, the immigrant slaveowners found a way to get around it. Mexico responded by trying to step up border security: In 1830, it banned US immigration into Texas, and started enforcing customs at the border. The immigrants responded by rioting, and released a set of demands including reopening the borders and independence.    Ultimately, the immigrants raised an army. Because so many of them had immigrated, they were able to beat the Mexican Army and declare themselves an independent nation in 1836. When Mexico continued to dispute (militarily) the extent and size of the newly independent Republic of Texas, the United States annexed Texas, declaring it to be a part of America  —   thanks to a resolution that specifically upheld the backward cultural value of slave ownership. What would have happened if Mexico had, from the beginning, taken ”border security” as seriously as the US does today (much less as seriously as Donald Trump wants the US to take it)? Would the stigmatization of American immigrants have continued to make the immigrants feel more American than Mexican, just as immigration experts worry stigma against Latino immigrants impedes their integration today? Or could Mexico have saved itself defeat in two different wars by building a wall on the   border back when the ”invasion” began?             Donald Trump likes to say that ”If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country.” One can almost picture Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna going ”Ay, tell me about it!” The Arizona dynamic: white newcomers freaking out about Latino   All of this is just an elaboration on a line that Latinos in the American Southwest often use: ”We didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us.” That’s true for the US population of Mexican descent as a whole, though it’s often not true of individual families (many of whom arrived in the US long after it had officially become the US). But even many of the Latinos whose families arrived in the Southwest after it became part of the United States have been residents of the region for much longer than many of the white people who are freaking out about immigration.    That’s the other irony of the border region: It’s been shaped by two different waves of immigrants. It’s just that one of them has gone unnoticed because it’s migration that’s taken place within the United States, and because the immigrants are white. Journalist Bryan Curtis pointed this out in a Daily Beast column in 2010, when Arizona was in the throes of controversy about its   bill (known as Senate Bill 1070) championed by  . Jan Brewer:  Senate Bill 1070 is often seen as an outgrowth of Mexican migration. But Arizona has a parallel migration narrative: one of Anglo migrants who came for the hot weather and golf courses, and, in many cases, brought along their conservative politics. Evan Mecham, the governor who canceled the state’s Martin Luther King holiday in 1987, was an arriviste from Utah. John McCain didn’t make it to Phoenix until he was in his 40s. Jan Brewer, a California native, relocated to the Phoenix suburbs with her husband, a chiropractor, in the 1970s. So Brewer’s blasts are, in one sense, correct. Arizona has suffered an ”invasion.”  If only Mexico had built a wall to begin with, none of this conflict and trauma would ever have occurred. Perhaps it even could’ve gotten the US to pay for it.

"Donald Trump’s campaign manager has no clue what a press conference is.      Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, sat down for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday to talk about the state of the campaign. It got a little weird. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR:  And out front now, Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, thank you so much for being with me.  I want to give you a chance to react to this news that Jamie just was breaking, former President George H. W. Bush says he will vote for Hillary Clinton. That, of course, is not just not voting for Donald Trump, it is voting for Hillary Clinton.  What is your response to that? KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Well, I respect the    former president very much and his decision.  And I think that Americans are very grateful to the Bush family for their public service.  That is his right. It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race, Bill Clinton defeated George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, Erin, in 1992, for his reelection. But look, this was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectations that he would be the ”electable,” the predominant person on the stage.  I mean, he lasted through South Carolina.  Got out of the race before March 1st. So I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.  That is his right.  I think what’s most disturbing about this report to me, Erin, is that someone divulged a private conversation.  It doesn’t seem it was meant for public consumption and that is always very bothersome to me. BURNETT:  Originally saying it to, obviously a member of the Kennedy family at a private gathering.  As you point out, he has, of course, since come out and said it and is    you know, said to Jamie.  But, yes, fair point, it was originally meant to be private. I want to ask you, Kellyanne, about the another story that is breaking tonight.  This is The Washington Post report, reporting that Trump may have violated laws against   through his foundation. And I don’t know if you’ve had a chance to read it.  But they lay out several donations that he made to charities in order to settle lawsuits.  One of them involved   .  It was a $100, 000 donation to a veterans charity, and to settle fines that    owed Palm Beach over some sort of a dispute about a flagpole. Of course, it is illegal to use a charity’s money to benefit yourself or your businesses.  Are you concerned at all that Trump may have broken the law? CONWAY:  No.  And I would point out in the second paragraph of that story that you mention, Erin, it says ”may have,” and later on in the story it says the IRS may want to look into it.  But of course they haven’t. And let’s just go back.  I think this is classic Donald Trump.  He wanted to raise the American flag as high as he possibly could over   .  I think a lot of Americans at this point would applaud that. And, of course, the county said he couldn’t do it.  It had to be smaller.  So they started assessing a $   fine.  So the way that they ”settled it” was for Mr. Trump to donate $100, 000 to a veterans group.  I don’t want that to be lost here. And so the money went to veterans.  You know, the Trump Foundation started out with Mr. Trump’s money.  He was its sole owner for a very long time.  And I want to point out to you that the Trump Foundation has no permanent, no paid staff, no overhead, no one from the Trump family takes a penny as a salary or as benefits. Contrast that to, as we know, the slush fund otherwise known as the Clinton Foundation.  As we speak they have their international donor fly in so that they can pick up all kinds of foreign cash to coincide with the U. N. General Assembly. So I think there is absolutely no comparison between these two foundations, especially when you think about Hillary Clinton being a public servant, secretary of state, while the Clinton Foundation was doing a lot of its cash collecting. I know when they left the white house they were quote, ”dead broke.”  But, boy, are they worth a quarter of a billion dollars now.  And it is no coincidence that it went along with the Clinton Foundation and her time in the State Department. BURNETT:  So let me ask you a couple of questions that you raise there, because you mention The Post saying ”may have,” and you are right, it does say ”may have.” It goes on though to quote a lawyer, Jeffrey Tenenbaum, who advises 700   annually on taxes, and his quote was ”I’ve never encountered anything so brazen.” Saying ”it’s as blatant an example of   as I have seen in a while.” Again, referring to that    example.  There was another one with a golf course as well to settle a dispute.  A donation was given from the foundation to charity. Can you categorically say there was no  ?  Or at this point are you not sure? CONWAY:  Well, I’ve been talking to the people who are responsible for the Trump Foundation today, trying to get some facts and some figures.  And so I know this is all developing.  We need to gather information. But let me tell you something.  It is very important for people to understand what happened in these cases.  Donations went to veterans groups.  Donations went to another person’s foundation, in another instance.  The idea that the money went for    when people hear   Erin, you know what they think of immediately, that it’s going or plane rides and fancy hotels and expensive meals and certainly salaries and overhead. Again, that sounds to me like the Clinton Foundation where a report this weekend said about 6 percent of their money got to charities.  A lot of it was wasted in overhead.  That is not the case here. (CROSSTALK) CONWAY:  . .. Clinton Foundation. BURNETT:  Kellyanne, to the point, though, it was the Trump Foundation and if this was settling a lawsuit that enabled Donald Trump’s business to benefit, whether it be    or a golf course, that would possibly then be  . CONWAY:  I’m sorry, how did his golf course benefit from him redirecting moneys that mistakenly came to the Trump foundation?  He redirected them to someone else’s private foundation based on a    contest. They were misdirected to his foundation, I’m told, by his accountants and attorneys.  They went to the right foundation after that.  How in the world did his business benefit from that?  How did    benefit from him giving $100, 000 to veterans.  The veterans benefit.  And I think that is great.  I applaud him for doing that. (CROSSTALK) BURNETT:  Well, the business, of course, benefitted by the lawsuit going away, being settled, right?  That would be how the business benefitted. CONWAY:  Well, there are man lawsuits every day against people.  That’s    I think that is a bridge too far.  I think you are making things up based on facts as they are not reported in this story which also uses a lot of conditional phrasing, I would like to point out. But look, foundations exist to help charities, to help those in need.  And Mr. Trump has been incredibly generous throughout his career.  I’m up in his office here in Trump Tower routinely when he is writing    he is signing checks privately to help people that isn’t even part of the foundation. I mean, can you imagine?  I know you can imagine, Erin.  You can only imagine how many people have asked Mr. Trump for his time and his resources and his connections and his money privately.  And he does that. He doesn’t have cameras in there.  It doesn’t go through foundations.  And by the way, everybody should also note that foundation disbursements, as you know under federal law, are all a matter of public record.  That is how this Washington Post reporter who seems a little obsessed with Donald Trump these days, that’s how he got this information in the first place. BURNETT:  So, but you mention private. .. CONWAY:  So it’s all a matter of public record. BURNETT:  Yes, it is a matter of public record when it comes to the foundation, and you mention that he writes private checks.  Obviously part of the issue here, for some people, is that Trump has not donated to his own foundation since 2009.  He did up to that point and then he no longer did. So. .. CONWAY:  For decades.  For decades.  For decades, Erin. BURNETT:  But since 2009    OK. CONWAY:  This foundation started in 1987.  Let’s be fair here.  If we’re going to throw words and figures around, let’s be fair to Mr. Trump.  The foundation, as I understand it, started in about 1987.  For a very long time Donald Trump was the only donor to the foundation. I mean, people think that there is no history before 2009.  Let’s be fair to him.  And you say that some people think this is an issue.  I don’t see it in a CNN poll anywhere.  I see jobs, economy, terrorism, health care, immigration. I mean, good lord, just down the street from us right here we had this terrorist    this radical Islamic terrorist whose   says he hates gay, he hates America, tried to kill people.  Thank God he didn’t. But he certainly scared a whole heck of a lot of us, and he certainly injured many people who have our prayers and condolences    our prayers here at the Trump campaign. So I do want to talk about the issues that Americans are talking about but this isn’t on the list. BURNETT:  I would say, Kellyanne, one thing though, of course, when you talk about those private checks and private donations, everybody would know what they were, there would be no issues if he just put out his personal taxes, because that’s where all of that would show up. So that’s the only thing I would say on that, is all that would be out there for everybody and quiet perhaps some of this, which I will say I do believe is a real issue, to have full financial transparency.  And I said that with Mitt Romney as well. CONWAY:  Well, one thing    I can tell you one    well, one thing that you wouldn’t see in his tax returns, Erin, is $16. 5 million for some advisory position at Laureate University that Bill Clinton gets.  You wouldn’t see $21. 5 million for 92 speeches that Hillary Clinton gave.  She gives speeches for free now, nobody seems to want to listen to them. She doesn’t get these rally crowds that Donald Trump gets anywhere.  So I think if we’re going to use foundations as an issue, we actually    that would be great if actually people want to do some fair,   reporting about the foundations at work here. Because the Clintons are very involved in their foundation.  Seem to have financially benefitted.  Seem to have used through the foundation to help, not to have necessarily the victims of the earthquake in Haiti get all the money they were expecting, but certainly to help their friends and allies and colleagues get special favors and be granted access, yes, at the State Department.  That has been made very clear through some emails.  But also around the world. BURNETT:  So, Kellyanne, I want to get you on the record about another news story out there today.  Of course, the tweet from Donald Trump Jr.  He tweeted a graphic yesterday that likened Syrian refugees to Skittles. The tweet was ”this image says it all, let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first.  Trump 2016.” And then the graphic said: ”If I had a bowl of Skittles and had told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful?  That is our Syrian refuge problem.” Now obviously he got a lot of criticism for that.  Mars Candy, who owns Skittles, actually put a statement out saying ”Skittles are candy, refugees are people, we don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy.” Look, Kellyanne, I know that you and the campaign have an issue with the lack of vetting that’s possible with a lot of Syrian refugees, with the increase in Syrian refugees, but do you believe that this analogy specifically was appropriate? CONWAY:  Well, the analogy was not    I don’t think it is as you just characterized it.  But what I do think, what we do know is that many Americans are very concerned with the lack of vetting that is going on. We see what’s happening all across Europe, Erin.  The lack of vetting there and just sort of sure, just come on over, that has been a disaster.  I mean, many women have been raped and you know that there has been    look at Germany.  Look at the problems in France. And, of course, you know, it’s really a shame to those refuges who want to come here through the regular channels and who are   peaceful people, which, of course, is most of them.  It’s a shame that people are resisting vetting programs that would actually just keep out those who want to do us harm. The idea that Hillary Clinton’s plan wants to increase Syrian refuges by 550 percent is very concerning to many Americans.  They know what has happened.  They know there’s   terrorism here. They know people are coming into our country like in San Bernardino.  And they know that they are being radicalized.  They come here on fiancee visas.  They killed 14 innocent coworkers whose biggest crime was giving them a baby or a bridal shower at work, and going to a Christmas party? So people aren’t blind.  They know    they want to have a country where people who are coming in are known to our authorities, those who are in charge of this.  And we have to start giving our local law enforcement and our federal authorities the tools they need. Many of them tell us, tell Mr. Trump and our campaign all the time they feel very hamstrung.  They feel like they can’t do their job.  So careful vetting of countries that are, again, where there aren’t    there is not vetting going on now, where we don’t have strict vetting processes at all, and which have a history of terror or exploiting terror I think is incredibly important. It matches up with what many people are saying.  As Mr. Trump has said just this week twice on the campaign trail because he actually does rallies with people, not fundraisers with donors only, he has said immigration security is national security. That is actually a phrase that resonates with many Americans. BURNETT:  So, Kellyanne, I want to ask you about something with Donald Trump.  You know, he was very, very critical of Hillary Clinton not taking reporter questions.  As were we at CNN.  That has a changed in recent days.  And Trump himself has actually not held a formal press conference in 55 days.  The last formal one was on July 27th. Will he do it again?  Will he start having press conferences?  Hillary Clinton    I mean, just to be fair, at this point, is now doing this almost every day. CONWAY:  Well, when Hillary Clinton is in front of the press, she has got the press asking her these    they might as well just ask her, lovely blouse, where did you get it today, Mrs. Clinton? I mean, some of these questions are not journalism.  Some of them are just    it’s great to see you, do you think this is will hurt Donald Trump because he    I mean, did you see this question from a Bloomberg reporter yesterday? And so, you know, she also gets words like bombing scrubbed from any    you know, I watched CNN all weekend and what are they saying?  Donald Trump called it a bomb before it was a bomb.  It was a bomb. And very few people were mentioning from a journalistic point of view that Hillary Clinton had also said the bombings or the bombing. (CROSSTALK) BURNETT:  But, again, the question, Kellyanne, is, is he going to take questions? CONWAY:  CNN added it to. .. (CROSSTALK) BURNETT:  Is he going to take questions? CONWAY:  Well, sure, he’ll take questions.  But, Erin, we’re very    listen, Erin, I have to respectfully disagree because Mr. Trump is out there, we have the press pool with us every day.  He is in public places at rallies with voters.  Not at fundraisers where the cameras are not allowed like which does constantly. And the press is right there to cover everything.  And you know what, they really do.  A lot of the people who travel with us don’t give us a the positive tweet, don’t give us positive stories.  Are they not there yesterday in Fort Myers where I was with Mr. Trump? There were 10, 000 people inside and we had 31, 000 RSVPs for a place that only held 8, 500 people.  I mean, it is just incredible.  We don’t get these stories from the whole press pool.  So, sure, maybe he’ll take a question here and there, but you know what, he gives press availability every day by doing these rallies in these swing states where he is every single day and they are there with him. We don’t get fair questions.  Just last night CNN added in the word ”racial” that he never mentioned with profiling.  Your network added in ”racial” to make it look like he had said racial profiling where he never had. BURNETT:  So, Kellyanne, I want to interrupt you there. CONWAY:  I’m answering your questions right now. BURNETT:  I want to interrupt you there because that was a ”lower third,” as we call them, on our screen.  It actually happened during this hour, and I want to make it clear the word ”racial” should not have been put in quotes. CONWAY:  Thank you. BURNETT:  But I want to ask you something about this though.  Because a lot of other people were happy to describe it as racial profiling without putting quotation marks around it because Donald Trump continually does speak about profiling related to Muslims. So if it isn’t racial, what specific profiling is he talking about? CONWAY:  Well, how about a profiling where just, hypothetically speaking, a man who then has pressure cooker bombs in New Jersey and New York’s father tells the FBI or tells authorities, my son is a terrorist, and then they drop it. They don’t investigate it.  He’s not on a watch list. BURNETT:  Well, he did recant, he did recant, just to be clear. CONWAY:  OK.  The father recanted.  Did they look in this man’s journals when he was caught yesterday sleeping in a bar in the middle of the morning, and the authorities caught him.  We just are so impressed with law enforcement. We, in this campaign, can’t show enough love and respect and gratitude towards our law enforcement.  And you saw it on display again yesterday.  You saw it on display again yesterday, law enforcement in Linden, New Jersey, capturing this criminal. And what was in his journals?  They found     stuff in his journals I read in the paper today.  He had been to Afghanistan.  His wife    or his   said he hates gays.  He hates America. He is a terrorist.  His father said he was a terrorist.  I mean, if the FBI is    if our authorities are going look the other way, then at least we have a presidential candidate who is telling the Americans who say, I’m so tired of looking the other way. We don’t have a vetting process.  We don’t have borders.  We have people just so worried about political correctness that this    look what this did the other night.  People were injured. BURNETT:  OK.  So but this issue of profiling and whether it is racial, ethnic, religious, all of them, coming under the same umbrella. CONWAY:  He didn’t say that. BURNETT:  But let me ask you, because it’s not just what you would probably call the mainstream media that is saying this and having these questions.  OK, it has come up on FOX News several times where they have interpreted this and asked these questions in similar ways. Trump many times has indicated that he supports profiling based on ethnicity.  Let me just play so you can hear it, Kellyanne. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL O’REILLY, HOST, ”THE O’REILLY FACTOR”:  You know, another thing you said that was very controversial is that you want to profile.  You want to profile Arab or Muslim men.  How would that work? DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, we have no choice.  Look, Israel does it.  And Israel does it very successfully. In San Bernardino they saw bombs laying around the apartment.  People saw it.  And they wanted to be    they called it racial profiling.  We didn’t want to call in because of racial profiling.  In other words a lawyer got to them and said, you got a problem here.  You knew this was    say racial profiling. But look, whether it’s racial profiling or politically correct, we better get smart.  We are letting tens of thousands of people into our country.  We don’t know what the hell we’re doing. I want surveillance of certain mosques, OK?  If that’s OK. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT:  So, Kellyanne, if it isn’t religious, if it isn’t ethnic, if it isn’t racial, what is it? CONWAY:  It’s based on what he just said, which is, look at San Bernardino.  Let’s use an actual   example instead of hypotheticals here.  In the real world San Bernardino happened.  There are 14 families who will always feel grief because people looked the other way. You saw all the reports afterwards, CNN went right out there.  And you had people saying, yes, I thought it was kind of weird, or I saw   devices or whatever they had said at the time. It wasn’t like if they were just hanging around my house or your house, Erin, and saying, or, frankly, all the peaceful people of many different ethnic backgrounds, in saying, gee, I didn’t see   materials. I mean, the idea that people feel that they have got a reason to be suspicious and don’t feel comfortable to say that.  I mean, I talked to Mayor Giuliani about this.  We used to have police officers were able to patrol certain places of worship based on reasonable suspicion.  And that has just all gone away. And so, again, we    I just want to say that we in this country    Mr. Trump’s message is that we in this country, if we’re going to have a country, it would be nice too know who is here and why they’re here. And in the case of this guy Ahmad Khan Rahami in Linden, New Jersey, he had been to Afghanistan and his wife said he came back hating America, hating gay, being so angry.  His father called him a terrorist. I mean, if this doesn’t raise suspicion among law enforcement, what in the world will?  How many more people have to die or be afraid or be injured in Chelsea, New York, Erin, for us to wake up? BURNETT:  All right.  Kellyanne, thank you very much.  I appreciate your time tonight. CONWAY:  Thanks. BURNETT:  The campaign manager, as we said, Kellyanne Conway, for Donald Trump.

"What Trump’s executive orders on Dakota Access and Keystone XL actually do.  On Tuesday, President Trump signed two executive orders intended to revive the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines  —   two controversial oil projects that had been halted under President Obama after years of grassroots protest and fierce opposition from climate activists.    While nothing’s final until the pipelines are actually built, these orders make approval much more likely. Trump has made supporting the oil and gas industry a key priority of his presidency, and this is his first big policy move toward that end. So let’s take each project in turn, to see what these executive orders actually do: 1) The Dakota Access pipeline still faces a review from the Army Corps            The Dakota Access Pipeline is a    pipeline that would ship 450, 000 barrels of oil per day from the Bakken fields in North Dakota to a shipping terminal in Illinois. It’s about 85 percent complete, save for a portion near the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. For months, the Standing Rock Sioux and other activists have been protesting construction there, arguing that the pipeline could endanger both nearby water supplies and sacred sites.    The Army Corps of Engineers had originally approved the pipeline’s route near the reservation, but the Standing Rock Sioux filed a lawsuit over this decision, claiming that the tribe wasn’t properly consulted. In late 2016, the Obama administration ordered the Army Corps to reconsider its decision, and in December the agency announced that it would also explore alternative pipeline routes further away from the reservation. This would require a lengthy environmental review  —   and meant a big delay for Dakota Access.    Currently, the Army Corps is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which means exploring different potential routes for the pipeline, soliciting public comment, and so on  —   a complex legal process that could take a year or more. In his executive order today, Trump told the Army Corps to hurry it up. First, he suggested that the agency might want to “rescind or modify” its decision to consider alternate routes. He also told the Army Corps to “take all actions necessary and appropriate” to review and approve the pipeline “in an expedited manner. .. to the extent permitted by law and as warranted. ”     So what happens next? That’s really up to the Army Corps, explains Sharon Buccino, an attorney and director of the Land and Wildlife program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The Army Corps could decide to continue with its EIS anyway, taking time to explore alternate routes. Or the agency could read Trump’s order and decide that an EIS is not required, after all  —   and hence rush to approve the route that passes near the reservation. If the latter happens, the Standing Rock Sioux and environmental groups would almost certainly try to challenge the decision in the DC Circuit Court. If the former happens, and Army Corps carries out its exploration of alternative routes, it will eventually have to decide which route to approve  —   a decision that would have to be grounded in the facts of the EIS. Ultimately, that decision would be made by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the US Army Corps of Engineers  —   a political position that will presumably be filled by Trump.  Bottom line: some sort of approval of the pipeline looks very likely. The big questions are what route the Army Corps settles on and how long the agency takes to decide. Trump is pressuring them to figure things out sooner rather than later.    In a statement, Dave Archambault II, chair of the Standing Rock Sioux, urged the Trump administration to let the EIS play out: “President Trump is legally required to honor our treaty rights and provide a fair and reasonable pipeline process. . .. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream. ” Shortly before Trump issued the order, the Standing Rock Sioux asked protesters to leave the site where they were protesting pipeline construction, noting that they need time to clean the area of debris before spring flooding began. It’s unclear if protests could resume around Standing Rock in light of this new order. 2) Trump is inviting TransCanada to renew its application for Keystone XL            The Keystone XL pipeline, meanwhile, was a proposed   pipeline between Hardisty, Canada, and Steele City, Nebraska, that would be built by a Canadian firm called TransCanada. It would carry up to 830, 000 barrels of oil per day  —   mostly from Alberta’s oil sands, but also some from North Dakota. This pipeline became a major flash point for climate activists during the Obama administration  —   and Obama eventually rejected TransCanada’s application, ruling that the project was not in the national interest. (Because the pipeline crosses national borders, the State Department has a major say in the project.) Among other things, Obama argued that the project, which would help bolster oil sands production in Canada, would undercut America’s “global leadership” on climate change. Trump, obviously, has no such concerns. So on Tuesday, he signed an executive order that invited TransCanada to resubmit its application for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also ordered the State Department to “take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review”  —   and reach a decision in no later than 60 days. On Tuesday afternoon, TransCanada said it was preparing a fresh application for Keystone XL. Environmentalists denounced the decision, though they have far less leverage to block the pipeline this time around than they did under Obama. Note that TransCanada will have to get a number of additional permits from the Army Corps and Department of Interior to finish the pipeline, and opponents could try to challenge the project there  —   but this is an uphill battle.    Trump also wants to study how to build pipelines using only US steel There’s one last odd twist: During the signing, Trump told reporters he’d “renegotiate some of the terms” of Keystone XL  —   possibly with an insistence that TransCanada only use American steel. (That would be a problem for the company: Only about 50 percent of the Keystone XL pipe suppliers were American, with the rest coming from Canada, India, and Italy.) But there’s nothing in the executive order about negotiating terms  —   and later on, Trump’s press secretary Sean Spicer said the president just wanted the pipeline approved. So this “renegotiating” bit seems to be just empty talk. Trump did, however, sign a third executive order on Tuesday ordering the secretary of commerce to develop a plan within 180 days in which all new and upgraded pipelines inside the United States “use materials and equipment produced in the United States, to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law. ” It’s unclear how this would be at all compatible with WTO rules, but we’ll see what the study says. He also signed two other orders intended to speed up environmental reviews of infrastructure projects. It’s unclear how much practical effect those orders will have; read Darryl Fears’ breakdown for more on that.  Watch: The fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline      ",-1.0
"Science that liberals can no longer love. Corrections don’t get more delicious than this: A     2012 study that “proved” conservatives show “authoritarian” personality traits actually found that liberals are the authoritarians. The researchers blame a coding error for their reporting the opposite of what their data actually indicated.  The writeup of the research in the American Journal of Political Science, “Correlation not causation: the relationship between personality traits and political ideologies,” summed up: “In line with our expectations, P [for “Psychoticism”] (positively related to   and authoritarianism) is associated with social conservatism and conservative military attitudes. ”  In other words, the mistake happened to confirm their prejudice  —   when the actual research showed the reverse.  But, then, the mistaken result confirmed lots of people’s prejudices  —   especially in the news media, which gave this research far more prominence than the usual studies involving words like “psychoticism. ”  Stephen Hayward, who broke news of the correction on the Powerline blog, notes that if “this study hadn’t come out conforming to the liberal narrative and sliming conservatives, it wouldn’t have attracted much notice. ” Let’s see how much attention it gets now that it shows the reverse is true.",1.0
"Please stop sending me pointless surveys. Congratulations! You’ve been chosen to answer a very special survey. Does the sight of a customer satisfaction questionnaire in your inbox make you feel A) Annoyed Over the past few months, I’ve been asked to take satisfaction surveys by Spirit Airlines, Verizon, Apple, the Hawaii Tourism Board, eBay, PayPal, United Airlines, Kayak, LexisNexis, Courtyard Hampton, Symphony Space, StoryCorps, FitBit, Indiegogo, Amtrak, a   company, my dentist and, most perplexingly, some company called End of Life Choices (I just turned 44; come on, guys). Not to mention the countless surveys I’ve been “selected” to answer at the end of any automated call  —   who are the people pressing 1 for “yes, I’d love to,” I always wonder  —   and the CVS pharmacist who, in person, urged me to go online and give her a good review. (“The sheer gracefulness with which Cindy sold me those   antibiotics was unsurpassed. Five stars! ”) Feedback culture has been ramping up for a decade or two, but we seem to have reached peak neediness. It’s rare to have any business interaction with anyone that doesn’t conclude with a plea to get online and dole out some ratings. So here’s a     review: Suck it up and figure it out for yourself. If you run a business, you should probably have at least a middling idea of what your business is supposed to be doing. If you’re also a human being, it stands to reason that you know what people generally like in a business (employees who are nice, stuff that works) and what they don’t (jerks, being jerked around). So if you’re asking any questions beyond “Is there something we can do better?” it’s kind of obvious you don’t really care what your surveys tell you; it’s just a fun thing you can do with technology and then you can tell your shareholders or whatever that you totally do customer surveys and everything is going great, thanks. You know who doesn’t ever ask for my feedback? Companies with amazing customer service. They don’t need to, because they know they’re doing it right. (We both know I buy too many shoes, Zappos, and I appreciate your discreet silence on the matter.) Ever felt a twinge of frustration that more people didn’t like your Instagram pic or your most recent tweet? That’s the contagiousness of ratings anxiety: Like companies, all we want is to be told, over and over, click by click and survey by survey, that we matter. Collectively, it feels like a chilling slide into the complete tyranny of ratings  —   a    nightmare recently portrayed in the “Nosedive” episode of Netflix’s “Black Mirror,” in which Bryce Dallas Howard plays a woman who needs a better personality rating in order to rent an apartment.  It’ll be followed up shortly by the movie “The Circle,” out April 28 and starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks, about a Facebooklike company whose motto is “Sharing is caring” and where employees are required to constantly rate every aspect of their lives  —   and spy on others to make sure they do the same. Gross. I’d go buy that yurt, except I’m pretty sure I’d have to fill out another survey: “Did Our Yurt Meet Your Expectations?” ",1.0
"Cab bursts into flames on NYC street. A yellow cab erupted in flames Monday afternoon in Midtown, sending plumes of black smoke billowing through the streets. The new minivan caught fire around 1:30 p. m. on 38th Street near the corner of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to witnesses and the FDNY. “The guy who was inside of the car came out and said, ‘It’s burning!’ ” witness Hasan Chy, 29, told The Post. “It was growing very fast.   …     Within 10 [minutes] half of it was burned. ” Another witness, Osama Alatif, 24, said the driver rushed out of the car, called 911 and then ran away, abandoning the vehicle before first responders arrived. “He had to save his life first,” Alatif reasoned. Augustin Zayas, 45, described a loud “pop” and said people were worried the car was going to explode. “[The flames were] big, it was high. Everyone was worried about the gasoline,” the witness said. The FDNY was able to put the flames out within a half an hour, but the van was burnt beyond recognition —   only its yellow bumper remained. People on Twitter described the terrifying scene, too. “A taxi caught on fire at 5th Ave. and just freaked out every human in our office,”   along with a video showing thick, black smoke outside of her office window.  snarkily, “Now that’s a heatwave. ”",1.0

"Lotte Reiniger, animation pioneer, predated Walt Disney by more than a decade.  Long before Frozen and Zootopia topped the box offices, filmmaker Lotte Reiniger  —   commemorated in today’s Google Doodle  —   released the The Adventures of Prince Achmed in 1926, the first   animated film.    It was a version of The Arabian Nights; the   feature tells the story of a young prince who foils the plans of an evil sorcerer and falls in love with a beautiful princess to the backdrop of an epic battle between good and bad. Even in 1926, it was a classic fairy tale  —   but one that marked a period of innovation in animated film. Reiniger pioneered silhouette animation:   detailed black cardboard cutouts put together with wire hinges, she would bring her puppets to life by capturing small movements frame by frame on a   camera with a strong backlight. It took Reiniger, and her partner Charles Koch, three years and 96, 000 frames to make The Adventures of Prince Achmed. When it was released, the film was so unprecedented ”no theatre dared show it,” Reiniger wrote. Nowadays, a color restoration of the film continues to circulate:         Ninety years later, Reiniger, who would have turned 117 today, still carries a strong legacy among animators, even in movies like Harry Potter.    Reiniger was a   wartime artist Born in Berlin in 1899, Reiniger always knew she was an artist. ”I could cut out silhouettes almost as soon as I could manage to hold a pair of scissors,” she wrote. ”I could paint, too, and read and recite; but these things did not surprise anyone very much. But everybody was astonished about the scissor cuts.”    Reiniger originally intended to become an actress, but as a drama student, her talents were quickly noticed. She was commissioned to create the titles for films, and after learning   animation from her colleagues, she put her silhouettes at the heart of the films. But her film career was marked by periods of war. Between attempts to escape the prospect of World War II in the 1930s, Reiniger and Koch made their films between London and Berlin. With every move, some work was left behind, until the two were eventually granted asylum in England. The original of The Adventures of Prince Achmed was destroyed in the Battle of Berlin in 1945. Over the years Reiniger and Koch developed a large portfolio of animated shorts. Taking from the most familiar fairy tales, like Cinderella and Hansel and Gretel, Reiniger would bring the stories to life with intricate cutouts.         She tackled the stories of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. Her films were silent, with   frames and fitted with orchestral sound tracks.      Reiniger’s work had an immediate and direct influence on filmmakers around the world, also impacted by the time of war. It was a golden era of animation: What was once seen as entertainment for children quickly evolved into wartime animations and war propaganda videos with adult audiences. Shortly after the The Adventures of Achmed, Japanese filmmakers began using silhouette animation, a technique later used in the 1943 animated film Momotaro no Umiwashi, a   feature. In the United States, with a vault full of wartime animation, Walt Disney studios announced its first   animation, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1934, eight years after Reiniger’s film debuted. Reiniger’s legacy endures today, even in Harry Potter  Reiniger’s technique has proved to be timeless. The artistry of the elaborate cutouts is an aesthetic   filmmakers and TV showrunners still strive for. Notable series like South Park have used actual paper cutouts to create flat characters. (South Park used the technique in its first episode before switching to animation software.)  In big blockbuster films like the Harry Potter series, Reiniger continues to inspire. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1, the producers invoked her silhouette style to animate ”The Tale of the Three Brothers”:    ”One of the things that got me excited about it in the early stages was the question of what it should look like,” animation supervisor Dale Newton said. ”We knew it was going to be stylised, but not exactly how. The producers came along with the suggestion of creating something in the vein of Lotte Reiniger. . .. What we got out of that was a certain simplicity and naivety. We knew it had to be told very graphically with bold silhouettes. But Ben and I were keen to make sure it wasn’t only that, that there was something else we could add.” You can see what they came up with here:      ",-1.0
"Without conservative Supreme Court majority, voter-law challengers make gains.  A coalition of civil rights groups, Democratic lawyers and the Obama administration has scored significant victories in overturning strict voting laws, highlighting how the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has removed the Supreme Court as a crucial conservative backstop for such measures. With the presidential election approaching, the challengers have rung up wins against their two top targets. Texas and North Carolina are now under judicial order to shelve comprehensive voting laws, passed by Republican legislators, that appeals courts said discriminated against African Americans and Hispanics. In Wisconsin, federal courts restored some   opportunities  —   seen as beneficial to African American voters, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic  —   that had been scotched by the state legislature. And a federal judge has been tasked with overseeing the state’s efforts to make it easier for those without the documentation required by the state to cast ballots.  [Big wins for those challenging strict election laws]  Of the three states, only North Carolina even tried to get the Supreme Court to put the   decisions on hold. But without Scalia, who died in February, to provide a fifth vote for conservatives, the high court deadlocked 4 to 4, and the   prohibitions remained in place.   Attorney Marc Elias exits a courthouse in Arizona after a hearing for his lawsuit against the state over voting rights. (David Jolkovski for The Washington Post)  With the Supreme Court at an ideological impasse and Senate Republicans refusing to allow hearings for President Obama’s nominee to the court, Merrick Garland, the final state rules for elections throughout the country are likely to be set in a variety of rulings by state courts and   federal judges. “We’ll be in    combat the rest of the way,” said Marc E. Elias, a Washington lawyer who has filed many of the suits challenging the laws and whose firm represents Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and a host of party officeholders and committees.  [Supreme Court won’t allow North Carolina to use voting law]  Outstanding issues in the lawsuits still in play include rules about the handling of absentee ballots; a question of whether proof of citizenship can be required for voter registration; challenges to purges of inactive voters; and methods for counting the votes of those who are registered and eligible but mistakenly cast their ballots in the wrong precincts. These issues are all part of an intense legal battle in which even a slight advantage for one party could prove decisive in a close contest. One hot spot is Ohio, a crucial battlefield in the presidential election and a state with a history of voting issues and litigation. Elias’s efforts there were unsuccessful. The Ohio Democratic Party is trying to convince the courts they should add back the “Golden Week” eliminated by the   legislature  —   a short period in which people may register and vote at the same time. A district judge agreed with the Democrats. But the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit overruled and said Ohio already provided more early voting than the vast majority of states. Elias has asked the Supreme Court to intervene. But he and   experts agree it will be difficult to win a the majority of justices needed to put on hold any   decision when the high court is divided evenly among liberals and conservatives.  [The crusade of a Democratic lawyer with   backing]  The “question of how one writes a brief (emergency or otherwise) to capture five justices on an ideological, evenly divided court remains a great one to consider,” Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine, wrote last week after the court’s action in the North Carolina case. Michigan is also at the high court looking for that formula. After decades of use, the state eliminated   voting, which allows a person to vote for all the candidates of a party with one motion. A district judge blocked the   law, opposed by Democrats, because it would slow the voting process and create longer lines, disproportionately affecting African American voters who favor its use. After the appeals court refused to reconsider the decision, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) asked the Supreme Court for quick action. Like others defending election laws across the country, Schuette said the   judges are disallowing in some states what is accepted practice in others. Michigan was only doing what 40 states already do, he told the court in his filing. “Having voters actually cast a vote for their chosen candidate  —   rather than blindly voting for all candidates of a party  —   is the very act of voting, so it cannot rationally be characterized as a burden on the right to vote,” he wrote. States won many of the battles that preceded the general election two years ago because the conservative majority on the Supreme Court refused requests to stop their implementation.  But since then, lower courts have become more critical. They have increasingly looked more closely at the intent of legislators changing election laws and whether the changes were made to disadvantage minority voters. “I think the winds are changing with regards to voting rights in the courts,” J. Gerald Hebert, executive director of the Campaign Legal Center, said in a recent interview. After the Supreme Court approved Indiana’s   law six years ago, Hebert said, most state laws requiring a photo ID were thought to be safe from challenge. The Indiana law, unlike those in some subsequent cases, was not shown to affect racial groups differently. In the recent cases, however, plaintiffs have been able to convince judges that some state laws were designed to discourage turnout by some groups or did not contain accommodations for those who lacked documentation, such as birth certificates, needed to get the photo IDs. The judges who ruled that Texas and North Carolina could not implement their laws, for instance, said the problem was not requiring a photo ID; the problem was that the states required IDs that were most likely to be held by whites  —   such as driver’s licenses and passports  —   and disallowed those that African Americans were more likely to possess, such as state government employment IDs or college identification cards.  [Appeals court says Texas law discriminates against minorities]  Sherrilyn Ifill, head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a recent interview that trials, with expert witnesses and voluminous records, were instrumental in rebutting the states’ rationale that the laws were needed to combat voter fraud and restore voters’ confidence in the election. “We always believed if we had a chance to try these cases, we could show that the rhetoric did not match the record,” Ifill said. The state officials whose laws have been invalidated say the real change has come in the makeup of the judiciary after nearly eight years of Obama’s nominations. Legislative leaders in North Carolina, for instance, noted that the   panel that ruled that the state’s law intentionally discriminated was composed of judges nominated to the court by Democratic presidents. “We can only wonder if the intent is to reopen the door for voter fraud, potentially allowing fellow Democrat politicians like Hillary Clinton . . . to steal the election,” state Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, said in a statement. And after the Supreme Court refused to reinstate the law, Gov. Pat McCrory (R) blamed the court’s “four liberal justices [who] blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. ” But Texas’s law was found discriminatory by a    vote of the full U. S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, known as the most conservative in the country. The majority was composed almost equally of judges nominated by Republican and Democratic presidents. It is important to note that the Supreme Court has ruled only on emergency filings by states that want to implement their laws or plaintiffs who want to block them, since there is not enough time before the election for the justices to consider their actual merits. But eventually, the justices will have to confront whether the new laws comply with the court’s precedents  —   or even whether those precedents should remain. “This will ultimately have to be reviewed by the Supreme Court,” Elias said. “There will be a ninth justice at some point. ” ",-0.5
"Steve Bannon in 2016: legal immigration is the real “problem"".  President Donald Trump’s sweeping visa and refugee ban is likely only the beginning.     Already he has signed a variation of a “Muslim ban”  —   and has suggested expanding it. He has pushed forward on the southern border wall, regardless of Mexico’s refusal to pay for it. And he is reportedly considering moves to overhaul the United States’ legal work visa program (  visas) that many technology companies rely on. To many, it would appear that Trump is doing what he said he would do. But behind these policy reforms, two longtime immigration skeptics are making a name for themselves: Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon and White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, who is a former staffer for Sen. Jeff Sessions and yet another   immigration restrictionist. (Sessions is waiting for his confirmation vote for attorney general). Before Bannon and Miller became White House colleagues and began drafting executive orders, however, Bannon was a Breitbart News executive asking Miller, a policy adviser on Trump’s campaign, for Trump’s positions on legal and illegal immigration.     Trump’s public stance has seemingly always been to keep the “bad people” out and let the smart people in. But a conversation between Bannon and Miller from March 2016, on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily first resurfaced by the Washington Post, shows Bannon and Miller may both hold a more conservative view on immigration.    “Isn’t the beating heart of this problem, the real beating heart of it, of what we gotta get sorted here, not illegal immigration?” Bannon asked Miller. “As horrific as that is, and it’s horrific, don’t we have a problem? We’ve looked the other way on this legal immigration that’s kinda overwhelmed the country?” Bannon goes on to decry the “oligarchs” of Silicon Valley and Washington and call the number of immigrants in the United States “scary. ”     Miller’s response is affirmation: “The history of America is that an   period is followed by an   period,” he said. As the power and sway of these two men becomes increasingly apparent, their conversation is worth revisiting. Here is the exchange:  BANNON: Where are we in the Trump campaign with the   visas? Because we got the oligarchs down there, man, and they have got Karl Rove and literally hundreds of millions of dollars, and they are coming with one reason. And they are coming for unlimited ability to go throughout the world and have people come here and compete with kids coming out of engineering schools and IT jobs. If you are in your 40s and 50s right now, people will tell you, they haven’t had a raise in decades in IT. What was supposed to be a great career turned out not to be a great career. It’s because of these visas.  And now you got all the engineering schools full of people from South Asia and East Asia. And it’s not that I have any problem with those folks learning, but they are coming here to take these jobs. You have turned over the entire American education system  —   we have cut out art, we have cut out history, we have cut out music. Why have we done it? STEM, science, technology, engineering, and math. We have told every minority kid in this country, you got to excel at that. What happens? They get into graduate schools, they can’t get engineering degrees, they can’t get into graduate schools because there are all these foreign students, when they come out, they can’t get a job. And they are looking for these people like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump who talk about immigration and talk about   visas to stand up for them against these oligarchs. So where are we on this? MILLER: Well, that was brilliantly stated. [. ...]   immigration and the   visa are just not the same thing. And you’ll notice when you pick up a copy of the newspaper, you will often see the phrase   immigration  —   and sometimes it is used by people on our own side, and I just don’t ever use that phrase, because the reality is we are talking about less skilled foreign guest workers that are less educated than Americans, who are paid less than Americans, who know less about the computing industry and about the technology industry than Americans  —   so I just don’t use that phrase.  BANNON: Is Donald Trump going to stand up to these oligarchs? That are down on this island with Arthur Brooks and all the swells of guys at AEI . .. down there with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, who wants unlimited immigration. . .. Is Donald Trump going to stand up to those guys, or is he going to kiss their ring? MILLER: There is zero doubt what Mr. Trump’s position is on  . And the statement that went out that evening from Mr. Trump, that he felt very strongly about, made clear that the   program is going to be reformed dramatically to protect American workers. If you go back and look at Mr. Trump’s policy papers  —   [. ..] The word   doesn’t even appear in that paper  —   because again, we don’t use the term to describe   workers  —   other people can, that’s their choice, but the system that he wants is that on the permanent immigration that we would switch from a   to a   system, on the permanent immigration side. Not talking these guest workers.  BANNON: You saw these guest workers. You saw the CIS report yesterday. You saw that, what is it, 61 million? Isn’t the beating heart of this problem, the real beating heart of it, of what we gotta get sorted here, is not illegal immigration? As horrific as that is, and it’s horrific, don’t we have a problem, we’ve looked the other way on this legal immigration that’s kinda overwhelmed the country? When you look and there’s got 61 million, 20 percent of the country, is immigrants  —   is that not a massive problem? You were with Jeff Sessions for many, many years. Is that not the beating heart of this problem? MILLER: Well, yes, it’s   and it is something I have talked about before at some length on your program. It’s important to understand that historically speaking, that immigration is supposed to be interrupted with periods of assimilation and integration. So if you looked at the numerically smaller immigration waves from 1880 to 1920, when the   population increased from 7 million to 14 million, there was zero immigration growth for the next  . In fact, the   population growth shrank remarkably. So from 1920 to 1970, the   population shrank from 14 million to about 10 million. The number of immigrants in the country, the total number of immigrants, shrank in 50 years, and the overall American population doubled. Now, to just finish this short history of immigration, from 1970 to today the   population has quadrupled, more than quadrupled, from less than 10 million to more than 40 million plus the kids that are from the CIS report. BANNON: It’s scary. It’s scary. Miller: So there is no precedent for that kind of growth whatsoever. If you were to follow the history of the 20th century  —   and you want to win an immigration argument with your friends, and they say we should follow America’s history  —   well, the answer to that is, you’re absolutely right. We should follow America’s history, and the history of America is that an   period is followed by an   period.

"Photog who found second Chelsea bomb thought device was a science project. A Manhattan photographer was the first person to find the   on Saturday night  —   and almost didn’t report the contraption to cops because she thought it was a kiddie science project, she told The Post on Sunday. “I had just taken maybe 15 steps from my front door, and I saw a pot on the side of the road,” Jane Schreibman said. “It looked weird, and I thought it was a kid’s science experiment, with wires coming out of the pressure cooker every which way. I thought someone was throwing it out. ” Schreibman, who lives on 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, left her home around 10 p. m. after a friend called to tell her about the blast. She went to investigate but found the roads blocked and couldn’t get the pressure cooker out of her head. “I had heard the explosion, but I thought it was thunder,” said the travel photographer, who was home at the time. “But I just thought it was going to rain, and I forgot about it. “The vision of the pot stayed in my mind, and I decided to take another look at this strange object,” Schreibman said. “It had duct tape, and wires going into the cellphone or remote of some sort. But I couldn’t tell because it was all wrapped up in tape,” the    added. “The remote pointed into a white plastic bag. “They’re always saying if you see something suspicious, you should call, so I did. ” She then left her apartment to watch for the cops and was alarmed when the NYPD bomb squad arrived. “A man, I guess he was a detective, saw me, and he shouted ‘RUN! ,’” Schreibman recalled, saying she went to a friend’s house and played Scrabble. She returned every few hours to see if she could get back on the block  —   and to her    cat, Oceaie, whose cat condo sits next to the window. “I was really worried about him,” she said, adding that neighbors had all gotten alerts to stay away from their windows. Finally, around 3 a. m. she spoke to a detective who escorted her home to Oceaie. The shutterbug said she wasn’t frightened to return home in the wake of the blast, given that she’s seen worse  —   like the Ayodhya riots of 1992 in India  —   during her travels. “It was still such a weird thing,” Schreibman said. “I can’t believe it was really a bomb. ” The pressure cooker was removed by the bomb squad and transported to the NYPD’s firing range in the Bronx.",1.0
"Tell us: As America votes, how will the U.S. election impact your country?.      As the U. S. election enters its final round, I asked several of our Global Opinions contributors from around the world to weigh in on the election and to illuminate what either a President Donald Trump or a President Hillary Clinton might mean for their countries or regions.  Of course, we would love to hear from readers from countries and regions not represented here: How will the U. S. election impact your country? Leave your thoughts in the comments, and we will update this post and feature the best responses.   Asli Aydintasbas, journalist and columnist for Cumhuriyet, based in Istanbul: The one silver lining about Donald Trump’s candidacy in the U. S. election is that, in some strange way, it showed the world that Americans are not immune to the global epidemic of narcissistic demagogues  —   that at least homo sapiens of all races and colors, from Berlin and New Delhi and West Virginia, are prone to the same rancid and discriminatory populism regardless of their per capita income and skin color. No small feat for humanity! At the heart of Istanbul, there is a tall building called Trump Tower. At some point, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, himself no stranger to divisive politics, publicly asked that the owners change the name, following Trump’s   statements. But in a strange twist of events, Turkey’s Islamist government has lately dropped its objections to Trump  —   on the grounds that Hillary Clinton received campaign donations from U. S.  members of the Gulen movement, which Erdogan holds responsible for the July 15 coup attempt. When asked about the   crackdown in Turkey, Trump told the New York Times that “when it comes to civil liberties,” the United States should not busy itself with the domestic evolution of others. That was enough to quell the   sentiments of the Turkish government. In many ways, the U. S. election will have a direct bearing on Turkey’s domestic and regional predicament. A Trump presidency would turn a blind eye to Turkey’s crackdown on dissidents and possibly encourage Ankara’s burgeoning alliance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton already demonstrated a desire to strike a balance between U. S. interests and the human rights issues in Turkey. She probably would try the same as  president.   Chung Min Lee, professor of international relations at Yonsei University, South Korea: Only Americans can vote in the U. S. election, but if South Koreans could vote, an absolute majority would cast their vote for Hillary Clinton. For South Koreans, the worst nightmare would be to have Donald Trump giving orders from the Oval Office to withdraw U. S. forces or to downgrade one of the most successful alliances in the   War II era just as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is building up his nuclear weapons arsenal. Unsurprisingly, South Koreans have greater confidence in Clinton’s ability to navigate very choppy waters in Asia, namely China’s rise and Beijing’s much more aggressive foreign policies. As the North Korean nuclear threat crosses a new threshold that could target the United States within the next five years, South Koreans hope that if Clinton wins the election, she will consider the North Korean nuclear threat as a critical   agenda. And as members of a nation that is critically dependent on free trade, South Koreans hope that even though Clinton is opposed to the   Partnership   agreement, she will continue to support open trade and to ensure that the United States will become even more engaged across Asia.   Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden:  For Europe, it looks as tough nearly everything is at stake in the U. S. election this year. Trade relations, security partnerships, predictability, climate agreement  —   you name it, it all seems up in the air. A win for Donald Trump would take the transatlantic relationship into a truly traumatic period. There will hardly be the usual race between European Union leaders to be the first in the White House, and it might well be that Vladimir Putin pockets that prize anyway. And the consequences of that might be profound. A volatile President Trump will believe Big Boys Can Make Peace, but a skillfully maneuvering President Putin might well overplay, and we might stumble into conflict. With a Hillary Clinton in the White House, it will be more of business as usual  —   but not quite. Her stand on trade issues is far from clear, and there is a need for clarity on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks. A summit with E. U. leaders will probably come fast. And we will eagerly wait for Clinton to set out a vision for a U. S role in the world that both avoids too much domestic controversy and is somewhat realistic in its ambitions. In the volatile world of today, with power far more dispersed and challenges far more numerous, that’s easier said than done.   Joel Dreyfuss, Washington Post contributing columnist based in Paris: If there were doubts about the importance of the U. S. presidential election to France, those were dispelled by the French media’s coverage of the debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Although the   started at 2 or 3 a. m. French time, they were carried live with simultaneous translation by several news channels. There is much at stake in the U. S. election for French President Francois Hollande, who has aggressively supported U. S. policy toward the Islamic State and taken a hard line toward Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Syria. French government officials have been circumspect about the prospect of a Trump presidency, but they are clearly worried about his threat to renegotiate   treaties, his questioning of the importance of NATO and his conciliatory gestures toward Putin. That is why the lights at the presidential palace at the foot of the   will shine late into the night on Nov. 8, while millions of French citizens stay glued to their television sets.   Dhruva Jaishankar, fellow at the Brookings Institution India Center in New Delhi:  Coming from a similarly raucous democracy, Indians follow U. S. elections with a great deal of interest. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have inspired a mixture of curiosity, ridicule, admiration and concern among India’s chattering classes, although surveys indicate that the broader Indian public does not hold particularly strong opinions about either candidate. Trump has offered mixed messages about   immigration to the United States, of which Indians are among the primary beneficiaries, and about India more generally. By contrast, Clinton has a long history of engagement with India, including as first lady, as senator (when she was   of the Senate India Caucus) and as secretary of state. As such, she is a known quantity in New Delhi. The stability of a Clinton presidency, a very good understanding of her positions and key advisers, and the implications her election would have for the United States more broadly make her a preferable candidate from India’s point of view.   Yasmine Bahrani, journalism professor at American University in Dubai: In multicultural Dubai, people know that the U. S. election will affect them, because it will affect how the United States uses its power. As one of my Nigerian students put it, “The U. S. election affects the whole world. ” In the Arabian Gulf (as Arabs call the “Persian” Gulf) people took an early dislike to Donald Trump because of his   statements; some of my students believe he speaks for a widespread American racism. But many here are also wary of Hillary Clinton because of her   reputation and because of the chaos she helped create in Libya while secretary of state. Many are hoping a new administration will bring a different U. S. approach to the Middle East. President Obama’s tilt to Iran has horrified people here, and news analysts regularly lay much of the blame for the region’s pandemonium on the United States’ seeming abandonment of the Arabs. Still, as unusual as “The Donald and Hillary Show” might be, everyone appreciates that the U. S. system is better than killing your way to power, the alternative so familiar in the region. But some of my wry students have taken another lesson from this unorthodox campaign: Anything’s possible in U. S. politics; the door’s even open for Kanye West’s announced presidential run in 2020.    What’s at stake in your country? Tell us in the comments. ",-0.5
"Trump attacked the free press, and he got exactly what he deserved.    The president has the greatest  . The best! “No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly,” Donald Trump said this week as he heard the special prosecutor’s footsteps.  Thus did our assured head of state, equal parts narcissistic and uninformed, rank his treatment worse than that of Benito Mussolini (executed corpse beaten and hung upside down in public square) Oliver Cromwell (body disinterred, drawn and quartered, hanged and head hung on spike) Leon Trotsky (exiled and killed with icepick to the skull) William Wallace (dragged naked from horses, eviscerated, emasculated, hanged and quartered) and the headless Louis XVI, Mary Queen of Scots and Charles I.  Trump hasn’t been treated badly. He has been treated exactly as he deserved, a reaction commensurate with the action. He took on the institution of a free press  —   and it fought back. Trump came to office after intimidating publishers, barring journalists from covering him and threatening to rewrite press laws, and he has sought to discredit the “fake news” media at every chance. Instead, he wound up inspiring a new golden age in American journalism.        (The Washington Post)   Trump provoked the extraordinary work of reporters on the intelligence, justice and national security beats, who blew wide open the Russia election scandal, the contacts between Russia and top Trump officials, and interference by Trump in the FBI investigation. This week’s appointment of a special prosecutor  —   a crucial check on a president who lacks    —   is a direct result of their work. I suspect they won’t be getting Presidential Medals of Freedom anytime soon, so let’s celebrate some of them here. At The Post: Adam Entous, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima, Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett, Sari Horwitz, Greg Jaffe and Julie Tate, along with columnist David Ignatius. At the New York Times: Michael Schmidt, Matthew Rosenberg, Adam Goldman, Matt Apuzzo and Scott Shane. The two rivals, combined, have produced one breathtaking scoop after another, including:  The Post’s Feb. 9 report that national security adviser Michael Flynn, contrary to the Trump administration’s claims, talked with the Russian ambassador about U. S. sanctions before Trump took office. Flynn was out soon thereafter. The Post’s March 1 report that Jeff Sessions also spoke with the Russian ambassador but did not disclose the contacts when asked about possible contacts during his confirmation as attorney general. He was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The Post’s March 28 report that the Trump administration tried to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying on the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties. She later testified about the White House’s failure to act on warnings about Flynn. The Times’s March 30 report that two White House officials helped provide Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with intelligence that Nunes made public. Nunes was forced to recuse himself from the committee’s probe.  The Post’s report this week that Trump shared highly classified intelligence with Russian officials, jeopardizing the cooperation of allies. And the final blow: The Times’s report this week that Trump asked FBI Director James B. Comey to shut down the FBI’s Flynn investigation, according to a contemporaneous memo Comey wrote before Trump fired him.  There were many more, and other outlets have flourished, too. On one day this week, the United States awoke to a report from Reuters that the Trump campaign had at least 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians; a McClatchy report that Flynn, who had been paid as a Turkish representative, stopped a military plan that Turkey opposed; a Times report that the Trump team knew Flynn was under investigation before he started work at the White House; and a Post report that the House majority leader told colleagues last year that he thought Russian President Vladimir Putin was paying Trump.  This journalistic triumph, made possible by nameless government officials who risked their jobs and their freedom to get the truth out, is all the more satisfying because it came as a corrective after one of the sorriest episodes in modern journalism: the uncritical, unfiltered and unending coverage of Trump  —   particularly by cable news  —   that propelled him to the Republican nomination and onward to the presidency. It’s a great relief to have special prosecutor Robert S. Mueller III now keeping his eyes on the executive  —   a regent, if you will, to protect against future abuses. This doesn’t mean Trump won’t nuke Denmark tomorrow. But those racked by anxiety for the past four months can exhale:   within the government have restored some order. Trump may feel as if he’s been drawn and quartered, but what he’s experienced is the power of a free press in a free country. That is entirely fair, and fitting.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: watch the new trailer.  The universe needs saving again, and there’s no one more suited to the job than the ragtag group of misfits known as Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. A new trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 debuted on Tuesday night, and by the looks of it, the Guardians have their work cut out for them.     The movie’s first trailer, released back in October, gave us a look at Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and subsequent teasers have offered a glimpse of some of the new characters Guardians vol. 2 will introduce. This new trailer adds more intrigue by including Nebula (Karen Gillan) a secondary villain from the first film now returning to clash with the Guardians. We also get our first look at golden villain Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) sitting atop a throne and promising to “cleanse the universe” of weaknesses like fear, jealousy, and betrayal.  But the trailer’s biggest reveal comes at the end, when Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) receives a surprise visit from an older man (played by Kurt Russell) who reveals himself to be Peter’s   dad.  Guardians Vol. 2, directed by James Gunn, is the sequel to Marvel’s 2014 space opera. Because the next big villain of Marvel’s cinematic universe is Thanos, and Thanos shares Marvel’s cosmic universe with the Guardians, there’s some interest in seeing how this sequel (and to some extent Thor: Ragnarok, which comes out in November) sets the table for Avengers: Infinity War Part I (which comes out in May 2018) and the Guardians, Thanos, and the existing Avengers together.     Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters on May 5. ",-1.0
