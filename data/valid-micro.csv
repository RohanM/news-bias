"Spicer: Conway was joking about spying microwaves. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was joking when she spoke about  That’s according to press secretary Sean Spicer, who said Conway’s comment about microwaves that could take covert photos was made in “jest. ” Conway had told an interviewer   that “You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets  —   any number of different ways  —   microwaves that turn into cameras. ” The comments were made in reference to claims President Trump made about President Obama  Conway   in an interview Monday on CNN  —   but didn’t say anything about joking. “I was reflecting what people saw in the news last week, which were several articles about how we can surveil each other generally,” Conway said. Asked on Tuesday at his daily press briefing whether Trump believed in using microwaves for surveillance, Spicer said it was “not a sound way of surveilling someone” and said his White House colleague had made the comments in jest. Spicer did, however, add that Trump does still believe “that there was surveillance conducted in the 2016 election,” but failed to provide evidence to back up the president’s assertion.

"Lyft Says, ‘Me Too!’ and Dives Into the Self-Driving Game. Conventional wisdom on self-driving used to go like this: A smart tech company, like Google's Waymo, writes the self-driving software. A smart chip company, like Nvidia, provides the computing power. A smart automotive supplier, like Delphi, brings the car parts. A smart carmaker, like GM, furnishes the cars—and everything runs on the platform created by a smart ride-hailing company, like Uber or Lyft. This line of thinking explains why players in this industry are partnering up like their survival depends on it. In the stage production that is getting you from A to B in a robocar, everyone plays a role. But some of these companies want bigger parts than others. Today, Lyft announced it’s getting into the self-driving business, launching its own unit to build autonomous vehicle software and hardware. “It’s too strategic an area for us to not be a player,” says Luc Vincent, the ex-Google StreetView-er who will head up the initiative's technical side.

"What’s next for this couple who won $500 million at Powerball? Work on Monday..      The Tennessee couple who bought one of the three grand   Powerball tickets plans to return to work on Monday. Because, well, “why not?” Despite their newfound wealth —  a $529 million prize —  John and Lisa Robinson revealed few grand plans for the money at a Friday afternoon news conference. In response to question after question, the pair seemed determined to mostly continue living life as they always have. When asked how they planned to spend the money, Lisa responded first: They would pay down their daughter’s student loan debt. [How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1. 5 billion jackpot] But surely they planned to splurge on something, a reporter suggested. “My family,” Lisa said. Would they at least move into a big, new house? “We don’t need that,” John said. “I’ve never wanted that in the past, I don’t want that now,” Lisa added. They announced plans to return to work on Monday. Why? “Why not?” Lisa asked back. “That’s what we’ve done all our lives,” John said. The pair said on Friday that they plan to claim their share of the world record $1. 58 billion Powerball jackpot in one lump sum, roughly $328 million after taxes —  money won with a ticket bought on the final day of sales.

After the numbers were announced, Lisa Robinson was the first to realize they had won. “I was running down the hallway screaming and crying,” she said. She woke her husband out of a deep sleep to confirm that they indeed held a winning ticket. Once confirmed, John wasted little time reaching out to his eldest brother to seek out help in finding legal and financial professionals to work with.

"Don’t Blame Pigs for Swine Flu—Species Hopping Is How Viruses Evolve. When new species evolve, where do their viruses come from? As little more than free-ranging bundles of genetic material, viruses desperately need to hijack their hosts’ cellular machinery and resources to replicate, over and over again. Without its host, a virus is nothing. Because of that dependence, some viruses have stuck with their hosts throughout evolution, mutating to make minor adjustments every time the host branched into a new species—a process called co-divergence. Humans and chimpanzees, for instance, have slightly different versions of the hepatitis B virus, both of which likely mutated from a version that infected their shared ancestor more than four million years ago. The other option—cross-species transmission—occurs when a virus jumps into a completely new type of host largely unrelated to its former one. That kind of viral evolution is notoriously linked to severe emerging diseases like bird flu, HIV, Ebola fever and SARS. Given the extreme virulence of those diseases, the apparent rarity of cross-species transmission seemed fortunate. But recently, when researchers in Australia conducted the first study of the long-term evolution of thousands of diverse viruses, they reached a startling conclusion: cross-species transmission has been more important and more frequent than anyone realized. Jumps between species have driven most major evolutionary innovations in the viruses. Meanwhile, co-divergence has been less common than was assumed and has mostly caused incremental changes. “They showed rather convincingly that co-divergence is the exception rather than the rule,” said Pleuni Pennings, an evolutionary biologist and assistant professor at San Francisco State University who was not involved with the study. The finding does not necessarily mean that emerging diseases from cross-species transmission are a more grave or imminent threat than medical science has assumed. However, it does reveal that the dynamics of virus evolution can be surprisingly complex. If scientists have been underestimating how often viruses can move into new hosts, then understanding which viruses are most primed to do so becomes a higher priority. There’s no shortage of reasons why cross-species jumps would seem unlikely to influence viral evolution much. The odds against a virus leaping successfully to a new host species are formidable. If the virus can’t manipulate the host’s genetic material and replicate itself, then that’s the end of the line. A virus might need to make multiple attempts to infect a novel host over decades or longer, accumulating appropriate mutations all the while, before it could finally establish itself, replicate and spread. This past spring, for example, a team of naturalists and biomedical researchers led by Susan VandeWoude, professor of comparative medicine at Colorado State University, reported an example of what seems to be an incomplete cross-species transition. VandeWoude studies lentiviruses—a type of retrovirus that includes HIV—in mountain lions and bobcats. She and her team kept finding a certain bobcat lentivirus in mountain lions in California and Florida. But every time, genetic evidence showed the virus came from a mountain lion’s exposure to an infected bobcat—for instance, from eating one—and not from another infected mountain lion passing it on. The viral loads in the mountain lions were also low, meaning the virus was struggling to replicate. In short, the virus was getting into the new cat hosts, but it wasn’t clicking with that body environment well enough to establish itself. “In multiple transmission events, there wasn’t any evidence that a new virus was now being replicative in the mountain lions,” VandeWoude said. (In contrast, VandeWoude’s team found that a form of the bobcat virus had made the jump into Florida panthers, which were passing around a variant adapted to them.) Given that the transmissions between the cat species are so frequent, the lentivirus may eventually mutate enough to find the mountain lions habitable, but so far that hasn’t happened despite many opportunities. Moreover, when viruses do successfully leap from one species to another, they can become victims of their own success. Particularly in small, isolated populations—which are how many new species begin—highly virulent viruses can rapidly exhaust the supply of available hosts and burn themselves out. It therefore seemed safe for virologists to assume that, even if cross-species jumps happen a lot over the long term, co-divergence of viruses and their hosts would represent the norm. But actual data supporting that position have been sparse. “The idea of perfect co-divergence is one of those things that you learn about, but then if you try to find good examples, they are really rare,” Pennings said. Edward Holmes, professor of biology at the University of Sydney, and his Australian colleagues decided to confront this mystery head on. Using viral genome data, they reconstructed the evolutionary history of 19 major virus families, each of which contained between 23 and 142 viruses found in diverse hosts ranging from mammals to fish to plants. They created phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees for both the virus families and their host species and then compared them. They reasoned that if a virus had largely co-diverged with its host, evolving right alongside it, then the virus’s phylogenetic tree should resemble its host’s: ancestral versions of the virus ought to have infected the host’s ancestors. But if the virus is jumping between species, the trees of the hosts and viruses will look different. How different depends on how many cross-species jumps are made. Their study, published in PLOS Pathogens, reported that for all 19 virus families, cross-species transmissions were common. According to Holmes, he wasn’t surprised to see that every virus family they looked at had jumped between species, but he was surprised at the sheer number of times they’d done it in their histories. “They’re all doing it,” he said. “It’s quite extraordinary.” As for why researchers hadn’t recognized the importance of cross-species jumps to virus evolution sooner, Holmes explained that previous phylogenetic studies had often taken too narrow a view, looking at relatively few species of hosts and viruses over short timescales. Over 10 or 20 years, you may not get a cross-species jump. “Over a million, you definitely will,” Holmes said. Their novel approach “provides a framework to start looking at long-term associations between hosts and viruses,” said John Dennehy, an associate professor of biology at Queens College, about the study. For Holmes and his colleagues, one insight into how and why cross-species transmission happens came from their observation that RNA viruses (which use RNA as a genetic material) seem to jump species much more frequently than DNA viruses (which use DNA) do. “That’s probably because they have a higher mutation rate,” VandeWoude said. For RNA viruses, the combination of a generally smaller genome and a higher mutation rate makes it more likely that they can adapt to a new host environment. Holmes pins the trend to the different life histories of RNA and DNA viruses, too. RNA virus infections are often acute but transient, coming and going in a relatively short time—as with the flu or the common cold. That transience means the virus can miss its opportunity to be part of the diverging host species. “If you’re an acute virus, you only have an effect for a few days or weeks,” Holmes said. “Co-divergence is very hard to do on average. You’re not around long enough.” In contrast, DNA virus infections are often chronic. When part of a host population splinters off to become a new species, it’s more likely to bring the virus along because more of the population would be infected. That increases the chances the virus can co-diverge with its new hosts. The host’s way of life also plays a role in virus transmission and the odds of co-divergence versus cross-species jumping. “We know that host population size and density are really important in dictating how many viruses they have,” Holmes said. He used bats as an example: Bats have a penchant for carrying many different viruses, but that’s at least partly because “there are a hell of a lot of bats.” With such large populations, they’re just more likely to contract viruses. “A very simple rule of ecology is, the more hosts there are, the more virulent things they can carry,” Holmes said. “The chance of a virus finding a susceptible host is just higher.” A 1975 Science paper from Francis L. Black of Yale University provided some insight into how human diseases are affected by a host’s population dynamics. Looking at fairly isolated, small societies of native Amazonian people, researchers found that although they could often detect chronic viral infections, acute infections were largely absent. Isolation kept the tribes protected from new viruses. The few viruses that did get in, if they were acute, quickly worked their way through the small tribes and died out. Without lots of hosts to sustain them, the viruses disappeared quickly. The discovery that cross-species transmission has occurred so often might seem worrisome, given its association with harsh emerging diseases. With so many jumps having occurred in the past, does the future hold more of the same? Not necessarily. “Historical jumping rates do not necessarily predict the future, especially when it comes to humans,” Pennings said. The way we live today is so different from how humans lived just a few centuries ago, our risk of emerging diseases is probably different as well. Humans carry a lot of viruses as well. We too have large populations, and we’re incredibly mobile, meaning we bring along viruses to new, susceptible hosts quite easily. “We have all kinds of behaviors that put us at risk for all kinds of things because we like to go poke around in places where we probably shouldn’t, we take lots of risks, we eat things we probably shouldn’t eat,” VandeWoude said. “We’re probably the worst offenders and probably the biggest target for cross-species transmission just because we do so many crazy things.” And doing those crazy things often leads us to bump against other species. The more we do that, the more we expose ourselves to new viruses, and the species putting us at greatest risk are the ones we interact with the most. “We’re more likely to get something from rats than from tigers,” Pennings said. But further studies of viral evolutionary history may help scientists figure out whether there are species to which we should pay more attention as sources of new infections. (Epidemiologists already closely monitor viruses at risk for passing from poultry to humans because of fears about bird flu.) Maybe viruses from plants, fish and mammals are equally risky to humans, or maybe those researchers trying to predict the next epidemic can narrow their focus to a select high-risk group. Holmes has a different view. “I don’t think prediction is in any way viable at all,” he said. “I understand why it’s done, but what I think I get from this and the sheer number of new viruses we’re discovering is it’s just not viable.” Luckily, it’s now much easier to do that sort of analysis with the growth of metagenomics, the study of genomic information extracted from the environment. For this study, Holmes and his colleagues pulled viral genomic sequences from a number of publicly accessible databases. They didn’t need to have physical samples of any of the viruses, which is a relatively new direction for this field. “Virology is moving into a new phase where, with metagenomics, you can now do this mass sampling stuff just to see what’s there,” Holmes said. Holmes also noted that because it’s now so easy to access new information about viruses, the phylogenetic trees that he and his colleagues created will change a lot in the near future. “In three years’ time, these trees will be much fuller because we’ll have found so many new samples of these viruses,” he said.

"Carmelo doesn’t know about Knicks’ Hornacek deal, either. The hiring of Jeff Hornacek as the Knicks’ new head coach is a foregone conclusion, with a deal expected to be announced after the Memorial Day weekend and a press conference likely Friday. It’s a process Carmelo Anthony is eager to see come to a conclusion. As he watched batting practice at Citi Field on Friday, the Knicks star was asked if he was anxious to learn if Hornacek was going to get the job. “I think everybody is [anxious] to see what’s going to happen, [to] see if it’s official,” Anthony said. Anthony declined to answer more questions on the topic since Hornacek hasn’t officially been hired  —   even though he did discuss the topic in an interview with MSNBC last week, telling the network: “Everybody knows he likes to play an   pace of game, likes to get out in transition, likes to speed the game up a lot.

"Target isn’t clowning around this Halloween. Target wants to put an end to the clown craze  —   pulling many of its   masks from the shelves ahead of Halloween. The retail giant said Monday it would stop selling clown costumes due to the spate of violence connected with people dressed up as the circus figures. “Given the current environment, we have made the decision to remove a variety of clown masks from our assortment, both in stores and online,” Target spokesman Joshua Thomas said in a statement. There weren’t any clown costumes available at the Richmond Avenue Target in Staten Island Monday  —   where numerous managers said they hadn’t seen any arrive on a recent Halloween shipment.

"Kurt Rambis getting 2-year contract extension from Knicks. CLEVELAND  —   As expected, Kurt Rambis will coach the Knicks. But as an assistant. Rambis will remain a member of new head coach Jeff Hornacek’s staff, league sources confirmed Wednesday. Rambis, who took over as interim coach after Derek Fisher was whacked in February, has one year left on his original contract and will get two more. The Knicks are negotiating the   extension so Rambis’ contract runs the length of Hornacek’s   deal, league sources said. Rambis and Hornacek were teammates in Phoenix for three seasons, from 1989 to early in the   season.

"Stephen Colbert went to Russia to ‘announce’ his 2020 run for president.    For Russian ears only: Stephen Colbert is running for president of the United States in 2020. In an appearance Friday on the Russian   show “Evening Urgant,” “The Late Show” host sat on the other side of the desk for once, bantering with host Ivan Urgant through an interpreter and playing “Russian roulette” with a tray of   shot glasses and pickles. Midway through their game, the American comedian interrupted Urgant to say he had something to disclose  —   but only if he could confirm first that the show wasn’t broadcast in the United States. “I am here to announce that I am considering a run for president in 2020,” Colbert said, delivering what was ostensibly a joke with a straight face. The audience applauded as Colbert nodded seriously. “And I thought it would be better to cut out the middleman and just tell the Russians myself,” Colbert continued. “If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please just let me know. ” The “announcement” was an obvious jab at President Trump and the swirling allegations that his campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections. Stateside, Colbert has been one of the most vocal critics of Trump, making the president the chief target of CBS’s   show. Colbert has continued to troll Trump, apparently even while traveling abroad. After Trump tweeted earlier this week that he had in fact made no “tapes” of his conversations with former FBI Director James B. Comey  —   despite ominously tweeting a warning last month to Comey that there might be  —   Colbert responded by posting a picture of himself in Russia.   . @realDonaldTrump Don’t worry, Mr. President.

Later, Urgant encouraged him to take a shot of vodka during their game of “Russian roulette. ” “To the beautiful and friendly Russian people,” Colbert toasted, before throwing back his first shot. “I don’t understand why no members of the Trump administration can remember meeting you. ” With their final shots, Colbert and Urgant clinked glasses. “A strong America!” Colbert yelled. “A strong Russia!”   [On SNL, The Rock and Tom Hanks joked about a 2020 White House bid. Some want to believe.]   Joking aside, Colbert has in the past ventured into politics, albeit, well, facetiously. In 2007 he attempted to be listed as a presidential candidate on the Democratic primary ballot in his native South Carolina but was rebuffed by the state’s Democratic Party leaders for not being a viable candidate. At the time, Colbert was the host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report,” where he played a caricature of a conservative TV personality. He would continue his antics in 2012, when he formed a “super PAC” and once again tried unsuccessfully to get on the presidential primary ballot in South Carolina. Failing that, Colbert threw the full weight of his satirical support behind Herman Cain  —   a Republican candidate perhaps best known for his “  ” tax plan  —   running television ads that encouraged voters to choose “the one name on the ballot that stands for true Americanimity: Herman Cain. ” Cain, a favorite among   conservatives, had already dropped out of the race at that time. (For those curious, the Sunlight Foundation broke down exactly how Colbert’s super PAC spent its money.)    Since last November’s election, Colbert’s show on CBS has enjoyed blockbuster ratings, in large part because he has been unafraid to skewer Trump and his policies, week after week. However, Colbert’s relentless criticism of the president hit a bump in the road last month, after he came under fire for making a vulgar joke about Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The joke prompted accusations of homophobia and calls on the right for Colbert to be fired. Colbert was relatively unapologetic. “I would change a few words that were cruder than they needed to be,” he told his audience a few days after the joke. “I’m not going to repeat the phrase. But I just want to say, for the record, life is short, and anyone who expresses their love in their own way, is to me an American hero. I think we can all agree on that. I hope even the president and I can agree on that. Nothing else. But that. ” There has been little love lost on Trump’s side. In a recent interview with Time magazine, Trump called Colbert a “  guy. ” “There’s nothing funny about what he says,” Trump told the magazine. “And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. ” In a rare unvarnished interview, Colbert recently described what it has been like to deliver jokes, night after night, under a Trump presidency. “It’s all so petty and venal, and there’s nothing grand about it,” he said in his appearance at the Vulture Festival. “It’s not Shakespearean at all.

"Donald Trump wins Indiana primary. INDIANAPOLIS  —   In a stunning triumph for a political outsider, Donald Trump all but clinched the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday with a resounding victory in Indiana that knocked rival Ted Cruz out of the race and cleared Trump’s path to a likely November   with Democratic   Hillary Clinton. Trump still needs about 200 delegates to formally secure the nomination, but Cruz’s decision to end his campaign removed his last major obstacle. “Ted Cruz  —   I don’t know if he likes me or he doesn’t like me  —   but he is one hell of a competitor,” Trump said of his last fierce competitor whom he had dubbed “lyin’ Ted. ” Trump, in a victory speech that was much   than usual, promised victory in November, vowing anew to put “America first. ” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders eked out a victory over Clinton in Indiana, but the outcome will not slow the former secretary of state’s march to the Democratic nomination. Heading into Tuesday’s voting, Clinton had 92 percent of the delegates she needs. “I know that the Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. They’re wrong,” Sanders said defiantly in an interview Tuesday night. But Clinton already has turned her attention to the general election. She and Trump now plunge into a   month battle for the presidency, with the future of America’s immigration laws, health care system and military posture around the world at stake. While Clinton heads into the general election with significant advantages with minority voters and women, Democrats have vowed to not underestimate Trump as his Republican rivals did for too long. Previewing Clinton’s general election message, top adviser John Podesta said Trump was “simply too big of a risk” to be president. For months, Republican leaders considered him a fringe candidate and banked on voters shifting toward more traditional contenders. But Trump tapped into Republicans’ deep anger with party leaders and outlasted more than a dozen experienced political rivals. Party Chairman Reince Priebus declared the race over, saying on Twitter that Trump would be the GOP’ s presumptive nominee. Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special   will never forget!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  “We all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton,” he wrote. Indeed, Trump’s first challenge will be uniting a Republican Party that has been roiled by his candidacy. While some GOP leaders have warmed to the real estate mogul, others have promised to never vote for him and see him as a threat to their party’s very existence. Even before the Indiana results were finalized, some conservative leaders were planning a Wednesday meeting to assess the viability of launching a third party candidacy to compete with him in the fall. One outside group trying to stop Trump suggested it would shift its attention to helping Republicans in other races. Rory Cooper, a senior adviser to the Never Trump super PAC, said the group will help protect “Republican incumbents and   candidates by distinguishing their values and principles from that of Trump and protecting them from a wave election. ” Indiana was viewed as the last gasp for Cruz, the fiery Texas conservative. He campaigned aggressively in the state, securing the support of Indiana’s governor and announcing businesswoman Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Cruz had clung to the hope that he could keep Trump from reaching the 1, 237 delegates needed for the nomination and push the race to a rare contested convention. “I’ve said I would continue on as long as there was a viable path to victory; tonight I’m sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed,” Cruz told a somber crowd in Indianapolis. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is now the only other Republican left in the race. But Kasich has won just one primary  —   his home state  —   and trails Trump by nearly 900 delegates. Kasich pledged to stay in the race, with his campaign manager saying the governor would continue to “offer the voters a clear choice for our country. ” Only about half of Indiana’s Republican primary voters said they were excited or optimistic about any of their remaining candidates becoming president, according to exit polls. Still, most said they probably would support whoever won for the GOP. Clinton, too, needs to win over Sanders’ enthusiastic supporters. The Vermont senator has cultivated a deeply loyal following, in particular among young people, a group Democrats count on in the general election. Though Sanders claimed momentum, he has conceded his strategy hinges on persuading superdelegates to back him over the former secretary of state. Superdelegates are Democratic Party insiders who can support the candidate of their choice, regardless of how their states vote. And they favor Clinton by a nearly   margin. Exit polls showed about 7 in 10 Indiana Democrats said they’d be excited or at least optimistic about either a Clinton or Sanders presidency. Most said they would support either in November. The exit polls were conducted by Edison Research for The Associated Press and television networks. With Sanders’ narrow victory Tuesday, he picked up at least 42 of Indiana’s 83 delegates. Clinton now has 2, 201 delegates to Sanders’ 1, 399. That includes pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses, as well as superdelegates. Trump now has at least 1, 041 delegates. Cruz exits the race with 565, while Kasich has 152.",1.0
"Parents, don’t sacrifice the end of summer. Time may fly when you’re having fun, but fun isn’t the only thing that can make time fly. Parents are already starting to ask where the summer went. We see the notebooks and pencils start to replace the sunscreen and beach balls at the local drugstore. The mailings from school start coming home. Emails about fall carpools start flying back and forth. And before you know it, August is over. While all of this planning is a necessary part of modern parenthood (especially for working moms and dads who can’t leave this stuff to the last minute) it also forces summer to end too quickly. Rather than enjoy another four weeks of nice weather, more daylight hours, no homework and freedom from a strict schedule of school and extracurricular activities, we’re already gearing up for September. And, sorry, it’s not simply out of necessity that we parents start hurling ourselves toward fall. It can also be very appealing. Parenting can be tedious at times. And doing it with less structure  —   as we tend to over the summer  —   can make it worse. The days after camp ends but before school starts can be a particularly trying time. Suddenly weeks of empty days stretch before us. We can only arrange so many playdates or trips to the amusement park before we start staring out the window waiting for a school bus to show up. Just think about life before children. (I know; it’s hard to remember sometimes.) For   parents, their existence prior to having kids revolved around work and friends. Even if your job wasn’t the most scintillating, you could get through it and meet your friends for drinks afterward. And during the workday, you had at least a chance to keep busy enough that time went by pretty fast. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls this “flow,” that blissful state where you’re so engrossed in the task at hand that you don’t notice time passing. It’s near impossible to stay in a state of “flow” when you’re caring for a small child, as Jennifer Senior observes in her book “All Joy and No Fun”  —   at least in part because your attention is constantly being refocused as the child changes moods and activities. You’re in the middle of your pretend tea party that’s taken 10 minutes to set up when suddenly she wants to go find her left slipper. Or she has to go to the bathroom. Or you can see that she has to go to the bathroom but she denies it. So you spend the next three minutes arguing about it  —   until the doorbell rings and she starts demanding a snack while you’re negotiating with the electrician. In so many ways, it’s more worthwhile to spend the time with the child than to enter numbers on a spreadsheet, but there comes a moment in the day of every mother where she longs for the spreadsheet. A friend of mine, a married      mother of three, once described to me the change in her life after she left work as a magazine editor. “You know how you have lists, Naomi?” I laughed. Fresh out of college, we used to keep neat pages of tasks, personal and professional, that had to be accomplished each day, or each week. “Well,” she continued, “I start each day with a list. And nothing ever gets crossed off. ” Gearing up for the fall is a way we can start crossing things off our lists again, start trying to achieve flow again. Problem is, that’s not what childhood is about. Childhood is about slowing time down. Kids are learning about the world. They’re supposed to be taking their time appreciating the color and beauty of nature, trying to understand how things work, how people work. Our lives necessarily require a certain amount of efficiency  —   we can’t just ignore deadlines and paychecks and household repairs and shopping lists  —   but there’s something to be said for slowing our pace in these next few weeks. Summer isn’t endless, after all.",1.0

"‘Trump’ doesn’t translate into Dutch.  President Trump might do the world a perverse favor. Voters in Western Europe appear to be looking at what America has brought upon itself and deciding: “We sure as heck don’t want to go there. ”  And Trump’s bizarre performance at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday did nothing to change that. The moment came after the Netherlands slapped back the   far right in its elections last week. The forces of tolerance and openness bent but didn’t break. It was a good sign for the year’s next two big electoral tests, in France and Germany. There was always some hype in the commentariat’s obsession with Geert Wilders, the viciously   leader whose party managed only 13 percent of the vote in the Dutch elections. He was never going to form the next government and had already begun sagging at the campaign’s end. Still, hold the champagne. It’s troubling that someone as extreme as Wilders (imagine a more malicious version of Trump) would get as many votes as he did. Moreover, the two big conservative parties, Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) embraced more hostile rhetoric toward the country’s large Muslim community to appease backlash voters. This worked in keeping enough of them away from Wilders, but at the cost of moving the country’s political conversation well to the right. According to the latest count, Rutte’s party emerged as the leader in the   parliament with 33 seats, a loss of eight. Wilders won 20, gaining five. The CDA was   for its escalating toughness on immigrants with six additional seats, and a new   party, the Forum for Democracy, won two. Overall, the right gained five seats. Many Dutch voters opted for what might be called a softer hard line. On the left, politics was transformed. The election was a disaster for the practical, moderate social democrats of the Labor Party (PvdA). As coalition partners in Rutte’s government, Labor endorsed his austerity policies, angering progressive voters.  So while the more   (and   ) Socialist Party lost only one of its 15 seats, the PvdA collapsed to a mere 5. 7 percent of the vote, and shed all but nine of its 38 seats. How much of an earthquake is this? Consider that at its most recent peak in 1986, the party secured a third of the vote and 52 seats.  But the bulk of those losses were redistributed to other left and   parties. (The left, on net, was down seven seats.) The true outsider winner in this election was not Wilders but Jesse Klaver, the leader of the Green Left Party whose representation in parliament more than tripled, from four seats to 14. The   of the Democrats 66 party also gained ground, up seven seats to 19. And a Turkish breakaway party from Labor, Denk (Dutch for “Think,” Turkish for “Equal”) took three.  The Greens’ Klaver, just 30, did well by being the most charismatic and uncompromising opponent of Wilders’s brand of nationalism. He argued that liberals and the left, not the far right, were the true defenders of Dutch traditions and “the values the Netherlands stands for . . . its freedom, its tolerance, its empathy. ”  If Wilders made identity the issue in this election, urban liberals and progressives countered by insisting on their own definition of what it means to be Dutch  —   and, in the case of Denk, by standing up for minority rights. This new politics of   will make life difficult for traditional parties on the left whose    was the    politics of jobs and incomes. France, which holds a   presidential election in April and May, and Germany, expected to vote in the fall, could deliver the next blows to the far right.  In France, the old French Socialist Party, like its comrades in the PvdA, is flagging, eclipsed by Emmanuel Macron, a    centrist who appeals to urban liberals. He’s running ahead of the far right’s Marine Le Pen. In Germany, the new leader of the Social Democrats, Martin Schulz, has catapulted his once ailing party into a close race with Merkel’s Christian Democrats. In defending Western values, Merkel has emerged as a powerful alternative voice to Trump’s. But Schulz might profit even more from   feeling. No wonder Merkel gave Trump a look of grim exasperation on Friday when he tried to inveigle her in his   charge that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped him. If Macron and Schulz were both to win, a moderately social democratic Europe would get another chance. This would be the biggest shock of a year that began with fears of a far right on the march. And Macron and Schulz share something important with Rutte: All three owe a great deal to the negative example of Donald Trump.                                   Read more from E. J.

"Facebook Sketches a Future With a Diminished News Feed. For most of the past year, Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to convince the world that Facebook was fast becoming a very different company—one that accepted its enormous role in shaping public opinion worldwide and would spend what it took to exercise its power responsibly. Many still have trouble believing him, and it's easy to understand why. Every time it seems as if Facebook is making progress against the hackers, spammers, and trolls hell-bent on turning it into a cesspool of hate speech and fake news, new problems surface. It's gone to huge lengths, for example, to tout its work to bring more transparency and reduced fraud to political ads. But Tuesday, just before Facebook released its results, Vice News reported that it had attempted to place ads on Facebook while posing as each of the 100 US senators. Facebook approved them all.

"Star Neuroscientist Tom Insel Leaves the Google-Spawned Verily for ... a Startup?. Add another high-profile departure to the list of people leaving Verily, the Google-spawned health science company: Thomas Insel, a neuroscientist and former head of the National Institutes of Mental Health who was leading Verily’s mental health initiatives. After barely a year and a half, Insel is joining a startup called Mindstrong, aiming to come up with technologies to diagnose and treat mental disorders. (The semantic web of Google companies: Verily, which used to be called Google Life Sciences, is partially owned by Alphabet, which used to be called Google and now owns Google.) I spent 13 years at NIMH really pushing on the neuroscience and genetics of mental disorders, and when I look back on that I realize that while I think I succeeded at getting lots of really cool papers published by cool scientists at fairly large costs—I think $20 billion—I don’t think we moved the needle in reducing suicide, reducing hospitalizations, improving recovery for the tens of millions of people who have mental illness.

"Trump says he would meet with Putin before Inauguration Day.      Donald Trump said he would be willing to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Inauguration Day if he is elected president, breaking sharply with precedent and showing little compunction over stepping on the heels of President Obama’s final months in office. “Putin has no respect at all for Obama. And I think that you have potentially a really catastrophic situation here, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump told conservative radio host Michael Savage during an interview. “I will say this, if I win on November 8th . .. I think I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration. I think it would be wonderful. ” Trump said that U. S.  relations are at their worst point since the Cold War and blamed Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for the frosty relationship. “The problem is Putin has no respect for Obama, at all, doesn’t like him and doesn’t respect him. And Obama doesn’t like Putin. They have a great dislike for each other,” Trump said. “They insult him constantly.

"How to change the world with a $1 microscope.  When Manu Prakash was growing up in India, he was obsessed with skeletons. Upon finding a dead rabbit, he would clean and painstakingly reassemble its   bones.    ”It physically told me how intricate every object actually is,” Prakash tells me. ”The more you see, the more you want to see.” The    bioengineering professor at Stanford, best known for   the Foldscope, a   paper microscope that costs less than $1, was recently awarded the MacArthur Foundation’s Genius Grant of $625, 000. I caught up with Prakash by phone recently to talk about honing the art of intense observation and the power of immersive science. From our conversation, I get why he’s considered a ”genius.” Not only does he use observations of natural phenomenon to build new, important tools to fight disease, but he’s also building tools to spread something more important: a sense of wonder about nature. A sense of wonder is what gets people asking scientific questions in the first place.    ”I know so many biologists, including myself, who had a start by just looking under a microscope, and there is a sense of wonder that you can’t place.”    There are two main arms of Prakash’s work. First, there’s the pure science. At his lab at Stanford, Prakash tries to make sense of the physics of the microscopic world: He and his team have discovered the secrets of how certain insects walk on water and how small traces of chemicals can make water droplets move like living creatures. Prakash  then tries to recreate these beautiful tiny movements of nature in tools, like   tests for malaria or a ”   ” device powered by a hand crank that can do medical tests. ”The idea in physics is to think about toy models, which is the simplest possible model that captures the events of the phenomena but reduces it to the simplest possible form,” Prakash says. ”The better we understand natural phenomena, both in biological and physical existence, the better adapted we will be to build powerful tools.”    That idea of simplicity fuels not just Prakash’s science but also his ambitions to stoke curiosity in others. To date, Prakash has distributed tens of thousands of his Foldscopes to students, researchers, and others (they’ll go on sale to the public in 2017). He wants the Foldscope, which uses a lens powerful enough to see red blood cells floating in a drop of blood, to be like a pencil: one in every student’s desk. It’s a part of a movement called ”frugal science” that aims to make scientific tools more accessible worldwide. Here’s more from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.    Loving science is about loving discovery, marveling at beauty, and being an explorer             Brian Resnick: The Foldscope. It seems like the intention there is to just get people excited about scientific observations.  Is that correct?  Manu Prakash: Absolutely. There are many phenomenal things just happening in nature, and they happen right in front of us and we just ignore them and move on  —   [but] we can engage a broader group of people thinking about these things. Once you build your Foldscope, we don’t tell people what to see. To me, that has been something philosophical: The discoveries that matter the most to us as individuals are our own discoveries. I can Google anything, I can see what a red blood cell looks like. But to see your own cell, to see your own T cell crawling around  —   that just means something different. It’s very valuable to think about experiences in science and how do you make these experiences genuine. When the Foldscope finally gets to people, we make one request, which is this: Share your explorations openly on microcosmos. foldscope. com. There is no hierarchy on that site. There are posts written by me and scientists like me. There are posts written by a    and [people] anywhere from a little village in India to a place in Pakistan.             BR: So you’ve sent tens of thousands of these microscopes out into the world. Are there any stories that came back that have really stuck with you? MP: There are thousands of stories. The tools are interesting, but the community is probably the most inspiring thing.    There is a    girl that has a few series of posts. She was inspired by the movie Frozen and got excited about what if she was the designer of that set  —   how would she come up with the fascinating [crystal] structures they use in this movie? She researched over months and months all kinds of crystals she could find, all the way to medicine cabinets, to ice cream, the maple taffy. It’s incredible to just watch her go and you watch her progression of how she came to that experiment. There are hundreds and hundreds of stories like this; it’s a continued progression of the same person and their way of thinking.             BR:  The educational value of that type of experience seems obvious, but it may be hard to define. How do you define it?  MP: The experience lives with that person. I know so many biologists, including myself, who had a start by just looking under a microscope, and there is a sense of wonder that you can’t place. BR: As a kid, I collected minerals. I had an illustrated book of minerals and crystals I must have broken the spine on. You were really into small animal bones. MP: This might sound terrible, but I used to find dead rabbits and then we would clean them up in hydrogen peroxide until the bones were perfectly white. The rabbit happens to have as many bones as humans, roughly. You have extremely small bones, and I remember spending four months building an entire   skeleton. I would do this for many animals. It was fascinating because when you boil them in hydrogen peroxide pot, the bones, they’re all mixed up. You need to know every single bone to know where it’s going to go. I don’t know why I enjoyed it, but I did.    BR: At that young age, it’s more about cool than science. Or it’s like a game.  MP: I feel it’s more about the tangible aspects of that work. It physically told me how intricate every object actually is. In every level deeper you look, you realize there is more to be and more to know. The more you see, the more you want to see. On frugal science            BR: So you’ve helped conceive of ”frugal science,” this idea that scientific materials should be cheap, easy to distribute, and equitable. What is your definition of frugal science and what should people know about it? MP: The best tool is the one that you have with you, not the one that you have sitting at home. From day one, when you’re trying to design a solution, it needs to be scalable to a planetary scale. With the microscope, the goal was to make something very rugged that’s going to be with you and is extremely functional. We made the decision that it needs to be an instrument to operate independent of any cellphones and any cameras. You can augment it by attaching a cellphone or a camera to then record and hear. But it was important that it would stand alone. BR: So are you trying to adapt existing tools, like microscopes, or build new tools altogether? MP: It’s both. One is taking cues from what’s the most powerful tool that we all use as scientists every day. They need to be adapted to the point where they are field deployable. It absolutely also applies to these new tools that we haven’t even invented yet. Primarily because if you watch physical phenomena long enough, you figure out how to exploit them in ways such that you could build tangible tools out of them. There’s definitely a lot of work that we think about that is slightly longer term but is about newer tools. New capabilities don’t always come in shiny boxes.    BR: Do you have any examples of that  —   a completely new tool that also would fit into that frugal category? MP: There is a beautiful paper which was described by a physicist, [Seth] Putterman, in UCLA, where he took Scotch tape and he demonstrated that peeling Scotch tape generates  . BR: Whoa.  MP: It’s insane. Think about it. It’s absolutely insane. He demonstrated that just using tape and a little bit of vacuum, you can actually take somebody’s  . That’s now spun off to a company that’s focused on a specific thing, but the stuff that sparks an idea is the fact that up till now   are very powerful. Hundred of different tools have been built around it but they all have used traditional means of generating  . BR: Can I do that at my house?  MP: You can do it in your house, absolutely. You know the screeching sound that you hear? That’s the moment when   are being generated. You can even put SLR cameras in very low light conditions and see photons being admitted as well, at the moment the tape peels off. On cultivating more curiosity in the world             BR: Do you think it’s possible to teach someone to be curious? Or do they just have to have it in them?  MP: I’ve never met anybody who is not curious. That’s just how we are  —   and thank God we are that way. We truly want to keep a global focus. We believe that there is an immense value when a kid in Namibia can interact with a kid in Alaska and a kid in DC and a kid in India. I use the word ”kid” as a broad description for a curious person. I’m a kid, you’re a kid. That’s what I mean. BR: Are you pessimistic about anything? MP: I wouldn’t do my job if I had an ounce of pessimism. I feel so lucky in any way and form that I get to spend my day and my life thinking about these things, thinking about the breadth of science. Science makes me happy. I wonder why more people don’t feel that way. I’m trying to understand that by just sharing findings and sharing tools.    BR: Where I have pessimism on this subject is people who don’t like thinking about science, who reject it even.   is a thing that exists. There are just some people you’re never going to reach, right?  MP: I would happily fail just trying. The reason for that is the fact that I think the people who have rejected the notion of science or have an ”eh” kind of a view toward it have not actually met science. Science is about open questions that ”I” care about. Everybody cares about questions. Then I want to have enough tools, and all possible tools, to explore those questions. Some of them get purely philosophical, some of them could be pencil and paper, some of them are just internal gut feeling that cannot even be put on paper. I think overall the lesson is you have to brush away a little bit of your opinion of what science is. It’s kind of like putting on a pair of eyeglasses. You don’t even need to call it a microscope, frankly. It also is a little bit about giving people time. Part of the value of Foldscope is, of course we do workshops and schools and things, but the goal is once it’s done the tool is there. You need to just take it with you. You might put it on your shelf for two weeks and then suddenly say, ”Let me look at it again.” In the privacy of your own home, privacy of your own environment, out in the woods, while you have nobody looking at you, you register something. What’s next?             BR: You’re a new father, with    twin girls. Is there something about being a parent that changes your perspective in problem solving? MP: Absolutely. I am observing them observing. I can look at them for 24 hours, not getting bored. Frankly, I’ve always been excited about this idea that the future is the people who will come in front of us. Now I hold the future in my hand in some sense. There is a sense of gratitude but also renewed feelings of passion. They are forming a model of the world, and if I give them a book, it’s not a book for them  —   it’s a hammer. They start pushing it around with things or they will use gravity by dropping it. I really find it fascinating.    And over time, they are probably the most curious observers because they’re seeing all of this for the first time. Somehow after living in this world, we build some crust or rust around us that protects us from all these observations. BR: They make you  —   already a super curious person  —   a little bit more curious? MP: Absolutely. BR: Final questions. How does the MacArthur grant change you, your life, and your ambitions and your science? MP: I think overall I haven’t expected any of this. This was such an honor. There is that overwhelming feeling, but having said that, I haven’t given it enough thought to think about what’s next. I know there are so many things ahead, so I am very, very excited, but I’m also just taking the time to even understand what this means. BR: What’s next for you? MP: In a couple of weeks a couple of people from my lab and I are heading out to Madagascar. We are taking our tools [to track mosquito species] out to the field, testing them. We are running workshops at a couple of schools there, and the goal is to really think about a   implementations in Madagascar. Also, I’m going out to look for more problems. ",-1.0
"Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 'Everything Is Love' Marks a New Step in the Album's Evolution. On Saturday night under the shield of London Stadium, just as Beyoncé and Jay-Z brought their most recent ""On The Run II"" tour date to a close, a large sign announced itself with a playful wink: ""ALBUM OUT NOW."" It was the latest message from two artists whose careers have been marked by public dramas both cryptic and blunt—they had again summoned their congregation; the long-anticipated joint album was finally, startlingly, here. The days since have augured all manner of revelations: the project, titled Everything Is Love, is a measured exegesis on themes hauntingly mundane to the Carters—family and success, love and betrayal of the flesh. It is a fitting finale to the couple's unofficial musical trilogy, which began in 2016 with Beyoncé's Lemonade, an album of sheer grace and fury—which was also televised through an hour-long broadcast on HBO—and continued on 4:44, Jay-Z's 2017 apology record, where he, at last, owned to his infidelity. ""I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions/'Cause I was emotionless,"" he rapped to his wife on the title track. One of the more remarkable aspects of Everything Is Love is its economy. It is an album of the moment—one that slyly speaks to the evolutionary shifts befalling the music industry but also reconstructs that narrative into something new and strange and necessary. ",0.0
"Takeover battle brewing as NYSE owner eyes London rival. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is considering a bid for the London Stock Exchange, looking to potentially thwart the London exchange’s merger talks with Deutsche Boerse.

"Five myths about the Pacific Rim.    John Vidale, a professor at the University of Washington, directs the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and is the Washington state seismologist.    A tragic month along the tectonic subduction zones that surround the Pacific Rim has also been a spellbinding one for seismologists. A magnitude 6. 2 quake on April 14 was followed a day later by a magnitude 7. 0, together killing about 50 in the Kyushu region of Japan. Less than 24 hours later, a magnitude 7. 8 in Ecuador killed more than 650. Major deep earthquakes in Burma and Afghanistan in April were also deadly, and a series of quakes this month struck Vanuatu, too. So many earthquakes of at least magnitude 6. 5 in a week is quite uncommon, even in the volatile tectonic zone known as the Ring of Fire, which encircles the Pacific Ocean. But the dangers of this region remain widely misunderstood, and myths  —   the concept that animals can predict earthquakes, for instance, or that the government knows they’re coming but hides the information  —   stubbornly persist.   1. Giant faults such as the San Andreas dominate the danger.   films such as “San Andreas” and “Earthquake” feature magnitude 8s and 9s. NBC even produced a miniseries called “10. 5: Apocalypse,” about a quake that splits North America into two islands. “The Really Big One,” the New Yorker story for which Kathryn Schulz won a Pulitzer Prize this year, explained the potential dangers of living near the large Cascadia fault in the Pacific Northwest. And the plate collision zones under South America and Alaska’s Aleutian Islands are famous for the monster quakes they spawned in the 1960s: magnitude 9. 5 in Chile and magnitude 9. 2 in Alaska.  But the bigger threats come from smaller quakes. Some are along the major faults, but even more are from the small faults right underfoot. Only one earthquake larger than magnitude 8. 0 is on the list of the 16 deadliest earthquakes; about   had magnitudes of less than 7. 5. Each year, on average, there are one or two quakes bigger than magnitude 8; 15 bigger than 7; about 150 bigger than 6; and so on.  Christchurch, New Zealand, had to be essentially rebuilt after a direct hit from a mere 6. 3 in 2011. Japan was shocked when a magnitude 6. 9 decimated Kobe in 1995. And the costliest U. S. earthquake was the magnitude 6. 7 Northridge quake that shook Southern California in 1994.  2. Huge tsunamis are the foremost consequence of giant quakes.  Two horrific tsunamis, in 2004 in Indonesia and 2011 in Japan, jointly killed some 300, 000 people. No wonder floods consume so much of our imagination. As a quote in Schulz’s New Yorker article put it, “Everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast” when a big quake triggers a  . Summarizing on Fox News, Shepard Smith predicted “Seattle, Tacoma, Portland and Olympia, Salem and Eugene, wiped out, altogether about 7 million people. That’s not including tourists. ”  But in the United States and many other countries, the costliest and most deadly faults are inland, whereas the subduction zone coastline is sparsely populated. The   tsunami in the past century killed a few thousand people, but in the past 40 years alone, a dozen earthquakes each killed more than 10, 000. The scariest likely scenario is a temblor that hits the heart of Los Angeles, the San Francisco bay area, Seattle, Portland or Vancouver, not the nearby Pacific Rim oceanfront. 3. Earthquakes often trigger volcanic eruptions. According to the laws of geology, where tectonic plates collide, volcanoes rise in the background. Volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens throw a long and deep shadow in the Pacific Northwest. And Charles Darwin said he observed volcanic eruptions triggered by the magnitude 8. 5 Chile megaquake during the voyage of the HMS Beagle in 1835.  But the connection is hardly reliable, as this doesn’t happen very often. A 2013 study in the journal Nature Geoscience found that two giant temblors  —   magnitude 8. 8 in Chile in 2010 and 9. 0 in Japan the next year  —   caused no eruptions and that nearby volcanoes even sank, instead of rising in response to the tectonic shifts. Because of the 100 or more miles between most volcanoes and the largest faults, such as Cascadia, the shaking at the volcanoes is relatively weak. Earthquakes result from shifting tectonic plates, not magma flows, and have only a weak effect on volcanoes. 4. The major American Pacific fault lines are “10 months pregnant,” “locked and loaded” or “overdue. ” In “The Really Big One,” the Cascadia fault is on the verge of popping. “Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a       cycle,” Schulz wrote. It is easy to imagine a valve keeping more and more pressure contained until it finally bursts.  Yet earthquakes tend to unfold differently with each iteration on a given patch of fault. Quake recurrence is fairly sporadic because the strength of fault surfaces is highly irregular, and so the complex ruptures are unique each time. Sometimes they break south to north, sometimes the reverse. Sometimes they break in two or three smaller earthquakes rather than one big one. The chance of a quake on a fault rises slowly after a previous earthquake, not suddenly near a “due date. ” After half the average recurrence interval, the chance per year rises to roughly the   average. The probability rarely exceeds twice the   odds; it is these fairly steady odds that we need to anticipate. The current risk of a magnitude 9. 0 earthquake for the Puget Sound, for instance, is 1 chance in 300 per year. Quakes are not like a pregnancy  —   after a certain amount of time, birth is not inevitable or immediate. 5. The entire Ring of Fire settles down or pipes up all at once. There have been six earthquakes greater than magnitude 8. 5 since 2004, after none between 1965 and 2004. Some scientists say we’ve entered a period of enhanced earthquake activity (“a sign of the times,” as a recent article in Nature had it). One week in April saw five places near the Pacific Rim with greater than magnitude 6. 5 quakes. Signs of the Times, a site dedicated to undercovered global trends, drew connections between 10 Pacific Rim volcanoes active at the same time in 2013. One   reading of scientific data says current conditions  —   including a spike in carbon monoxide  —   indicate that it’s unsafe to visit the West Coast.  Our relentless imagination, coupled with our compulsion to spot patterns in the noise, makes us poor statisticians of combinations of widely separated earthquakes. A century of observing large quakes tells us that the biggest events trigger, at most, a tiny number of earthquakes beyond 1, 000 miles away. A bad day in Ecuador does not mean a dangerous day in Japan, and vice versa. It may be frustrating that our estimates of earthquake danger change little from day to day and year to year, except for the temporary threat of aftershocks. Personally, I consider it reassuring. There really is almost nothing to foreshadow big quakes, although we continue to prospect for silver bullets. Relax, build a     and   society, and play it as it lies.

"Almost half of Americans won’t pay federal income tax. Many Americans won’t owe the government a dime today. More than four in 10 American households (44. 3%)  —   or upwards of 76 million  —   didn’t pay any income tax to the federal government last year,   This year that number is expected to be roughly the same, at 43. 9%. Most of these people aren’t paying income taxes because they either don’t have any income that is taxable (many fall below the poverty line) or because they get enough tax breaks and don’t owe the government money. Common tax breaks include the child tax credit, the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the exclusion of some or all Social Security income, explains Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center.

"Internet stalking reunited these high school sweethearts. In 2003, when Shalonna Walton broke up with her   boyfriend, Brent Broadnax, before heading off to Rutgers University, it spelled the end for the young couple.  “She said she wanted to soul search and all that junk,’’ says Broadnax, 32, with a hint of lingering bitterness.  Over the next 10 years, the two hardly spoke. Broadnax, who works in digital marketing, got married and divorced.  “I was hostile to her because she broke my heart,’’ he explains. “I did spy on her a bit through Facebook, though. ’’ But when a former classmate passed away in 2014, the two reconnected in a Facebook comment thread about their late friend.  A year later, the New   couple were engaged.  “We talked and started to remember why we fell for each other in the first place,” Broadnax recalls. “Shalonna was there at a pivotal time in my life as a teenager. ” Thanks to social media, more and more people are reuniting with their   and college sweethearts. According to a poll conducted in early March by Winq, a polling app that targets millennials, 26 percent of users have gotten back together with people they dated in school.  “People are looking for things that have a foundation, and they find comfort in familiarity, history and old values,” says Stephen Josephson, a diplomate in cognitive behavioral psychology at Cornell University Medical Center.  I was hostile to her because she broke my heart. I did spy on her a bit through Facebook, though. But, such situations can be unhealthy, say some experts.  “Reuniting with past connections [can] also be based on repetition of a bad relationship and recurrence of the same old destructive patterns,” says Ari Fridkis, a Manhattan psychotherapist. That was the case for Brooklyn Law School professor Jonathan Askin, 52. As a Harvard undergrad, he dated a beautiful classmate, Jocelyn Morin, for two years, but the passion eventually cooled, even when Morin attempted to reignite it by appearing in Playboy’s “Women of the Ivy League” issue.  After graduating in 1986, they both went their separate ways. Each married and divorced. Askin became a successful lawyer, while Morin published several novels.  Then, in 2011, she reached out to him with a legal question on LinkedIn. He replied and asked if she planned to go to their upcoming 25th college reunion. They both were living in New York at that point, and they made plans to get together.  “We met in Brooklyn a few days before the reunion, went to a restaurant, a cafe, a bar and then his apartment,’’ recalls Morin, who now lives in Tudor City. “I felt like I had found someone precious who I had lost. We had been so in love and had a bond I was never able to replicate. What had dissipated at the end of our relationship was instantly back and we were totally in love again. ’’  At the Harvard reunion, Askin and Morin stayed in a freshman dorm room together, visited the bars they used to frequent and fell back in love. They dated seriously for six months, but then their passion cooled, as it had when they were younger. They decided it was best to break up. “Eventually we found ourselves at the same dry spot we’d encountered a quarter of a century earlier,” says Morin. “The new relationship played out [with] the same dynamic, and left us on the same shore, going our separate ways. ’’ Ultimately, though, Askin says that the experience was healing.  “That first breakup was profound and life shaking, and this was the opportunity for a ’’ says Askin, who’s now happily living with another woman. “Until then, there was always the specter of that relationship haunting my life  —   but realizing we weren’t the perfect idealized love allowed me to get past it and find love with someone else. ’’ For others, reuniting with an old crush offers the opportunity to explore a relationship that was never that serious in their youth  —   but always had potential. Emily Lyons, 32, and Ryan Clark, 33, first met in nursery school in Ontario, and he later tried to kiss her at a   party.  “I was shy and blew him off,” recalls Lyons. “He was a jock and seemed cocky. ”  The pair crossed paths again when she was 23, and they ran into each other in Toronto. They went out on a date, but then she moved to New York to develop her   company and he remained in Canada to work in telecommunications.  It wasn’t until this past fall, when she saw a photo of him on Facebook, that they really connected.  “I messaged him: ‘Looking good, Clark,’ and he suggested we go for sushi,” says Lyons, who now divides her time between the West Village and Toronto. She and Clark plan to start living together in an apartment in the latter city in April.  Ashley Norman and Andrew Caspelli had a similar trajectory. In the summer of 1999, they were both college students waiting tables in Myrtle Beach, SC. They dated a bit, but Norman didn’t want anything serious since they would be returning to distant colleges  —   her to West Virginia University, him to Duke in North Carolina  —   at the end of the summer.  “We always had a deep connection, but at that time I wasn’t interested in pursuing anything further,” she says. They kept in touch a bit here and there. Then, two years ago, Caspelli, who was living in Miami at the time, posted a picture on Facebook of a Labrador pup he’d rescued. Norman couldn’t resist.  “I became obsessed with that dog and wanted to meet him,’’ says Norman, 38, who was living in Brooklyn at that point. She and Caspelli started chatting on social media. Then, Caspelli got a job offer to open a bar in Hamilton Heights. He moved to New York in June 2015 and started dating Norman a few months later. The bar, Uptown Bourbon, opened last July. Caspelli and Norman have now been seriously dating for seven months. She’s thrilled they’re finally together, but is doubtful things would have worked out the first time around. “We weren’t evolved [at that point],” says Norman. “It never would have worked. ”",1.0
"Why does Trump go googly-eyed for Putin?.  Coming from a presidential candidate, Donald Trump’s   admiration of Russia and its autocratic leader was weird. Coming from a   it’s nothing short of alarming. I repeat the questions I asked back in September: What’s the deal with Trump and Russia? Does he have financial entanglements with Russian banks, businesses or billionaires that color his views? If not, as he claims, then why won’t he release the personal and business tax returns that could put the matter to rest? The latest sign of Trump’s infatuation is his refusal to accept the conclusion of the U. S. intelligence community that Russian   hackers meddled in our election  —   a risky and provocative operation that could have been authorized only by Vladimir Putin. “It could be somebody else,” Trump told reporters on New Year’s Eve. “And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation. ” The   added that “I know a lot about hacking, and hacking is a very hard thing to prove. ”  It is unclear how Trump could know even a little about hacking, since he rarely uses computers. Aides reportedly must print out news articles for him to read. In my experience, experts on cybersecurity know how to use a Web browser.      (Reuters)   Trump is scheduled to receive a full briefing on the issue Friday from senior officials, including FBI Director James B. Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. President Obama has seen the evidence  —   and was convinced enough to impose new sanctions against Russia as punishment.  When Putin decided not to reciprocate, given that Obama will soon leave office, Trump offered this glowing comment on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  —   I always knew he was very smart!”  Trump has argued that because the CIA was in error about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, it may well be wrong about Russian hacking. That’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that because Trump was wrong when he claimed early in the campaign to have seen thousands of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on   everything he has said since may well be exaggerated,   or a   lie. On second thought, maybe I should choose a different analogy. One possible reason for Trump’s stubbornness is that intelligence officials believe the intent of the hacking was not merely to shake public confidence in the U. S. electoral process but also to help Trump win the election. The hacked material that was allowed to surface, mostly through WikiLeaks, contained embarrassing information about Democratic institutions and individuals, including the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. Republicans were almost completely spared. Perhaps believing that the legitimacy of his victory is being impugned, Trump is willing to take the founder of WikiLeaks  —   a fugitive from justice on sexual assault allegations  —   at his word. Trump tweeted Wednesday: “Julian Assange said ‘a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta’  —   why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” Another possible explanation is that Trump is deliberately making a huge shift in U. S. foreign policy regarding the other two global superpowers. Not only has he been much more indulgent of Russia than recent presidents, but also he has taken a much tougher and more confrontational line toward China. This smacks of   and      statecraft, which became obsolete with the advent of modern weapons. Such machinations cannot be advisable in the nuclear age. On New Year’s Eve, as Trump prepared to host a   gala at his    estate, two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  —   John McCain ( .) and Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.)  —   joined Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( .) in meeting with   Ukrainian troops who are defending their country against   military aggression. In 2014, Putin annexed Crimea by force. A few years earlier, he sent troops into the sovereign nation of Georgia. Perhaps Trump doesn’t believe all of this is really happening. Maybe he doesn’t care. The senators made clear they want tougher sanctions against Russia to punish its territorial ambitions and its outrageous attempt to influence our election. How to deal with Putin could be the first big foreign policy fight between the new president and the   Congress. Perhaps McCain and his colleagues will get to the bottom of why Trump, who sounds like such a tough guy with regard to the rest of the world, is such a pussycat when it comes to Russia.

"Nature’s Hidden Order Reveals Itself in a Bird's Eye. Seven years ago, Joe Corbo stared into the eye of a chicken and saw something astonishing. The color-sensitive cone cells that carpeted the retina (detached from the fowl, and mounted under a microscope) appeared as polka dots of five different colors and sizes. But Corbo observed that, unlike the randomly dispersed cones in human eyes, or the neat rows of cones in the eyes of many fish, the chicken’s cones had a haphazard and yet remarkably uniform distribution. The dots’ locations followed no discernible rule, and yet dots never appeared too close together or too far apart. Each of the five interspersed sets of cones, and all of them together, exhibited this same arresting mix of randomness and regularity. Corbo, who runs a biology lab at Washington University in St. Louis, was hooked. Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent division of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences “It’s extremely beautiful just to look at these patterns,” he said. “We were kind of captured by the beauty, and had, purely out of curiosity, the desire to understand the patterns better.” He and his collaborators also hoped to figure out the patterns’ function, and how they were generated. He didn’t know then that these same questions were being asked in numerous other contexts, or that he had found the first biological manifestation of a type of hidden order that has also turned up all over mathematics and physics. Corbo did know that whatever bird retinas are doing is probably the thing to do. Avian vision works spectacularly well (enabling eagles, for instance, to spot mice from a mile high), and his lab studies the evolutionary adaptations that make this so. Many of these attributes are believed to have been passed down to birds from a lizardlike creature that, 300 million years ago, gave rise to both dinosaurs and proto-mammals. While birds’ ancestors, the dinos, ruled the planetary roost, our mammalian kin scurried around in the dark, fearfully nocturnal and gradually losing color discrimination. Mammals’ cone types dropped to two—a nadir from which we are still clambering back. About 30 million years ago, one of our primate ancestors’ cones split into two—red- and green-detecting—which, together with the existing blue-detecting cone, give us trichromatic vision. But our cones, particularly the newer red and green ones, have a clumpy, scattershot distribution and sample light unevenly. Bird eyes have had eons longer to optimize. Along with their higher cone count, they achieve a far more regular spacing of the cells. But why, Corbo and colleagues wondered, had evolution not opted for the perfect regularity of a grid or “lattice” distribution of cones? The strange, uncategorizable pattern they observed in the retinas was, in all likelihood, optimizing some unknown set of constraints. What these were, what the pattern was, and how the avian visual system achieved it remained unclear. The biologists did their best to quantify the regularity in the retinas, but this was unfamiliar terrain, and they needed help. In 2012, Corbo contacted Salvatore Torquato, a professor of theoretical chemistry at Princeton University and a renowned expert in a discipline known as “packing.” Packing problems ask about the densest way to pack objects (such as cone cells of five different sizes) in a given number of dimensions (in the case of a retina, two). “I wanted to get at this question of whether such a system was optimally packed,” Corbo said. Intrigued, Torquato ran some algorithms on digital images of the retinal patterns and “was astounded,” Corbo recalled, “to see the same phenomenon occurring in these systems as they’d seen in a lot of inorganic or physical systems.” Torquato had been studying this hidden order since the early 2000s, when he dubbed it “hyperuniformity.” (This term has largely won out over “superhomogeneity,” coined around the same time by Joel Lebowitz of Rutgers University.) Since then, it has turned up in a rapidly expanding family of systems. Beyond bird eyes, hyperuniformity is found in materials called quasicrystals, as well as in mathematical matrices full of random numbers, the large-scale structure of the universe, quantum ensembles, and soft-matter systems like emulsions and colloids. Scientists are nearly always taken by surprise when it pops up in new places, as if playing whack-a-mole with the universe. They are still searching for a unifying concept underlying these occurrences. In the process, they’ve uncovered novel properties of hyperuniform materials that could prove technologically useful. From a mathematical standpoint, “the more you study it, the more elegant and conceptually compelling it seems,” said Henry Cohn, a mathematician and packing expert at Microsoft Research New England, referring to hyperuniformity. “On the other hand, what surprises me about it is the potential breadth of its applications.” Torquato and a colleague launched the study of hyperuniformity 13 years ago, describing it theoretically and identifying a simple yet surprising example: “You take marbles, you put them in a container, you shake them up until they jam,” Torquato said in his Princeton office this spring. “That system is hyperuniform.” I see hyperuniformity as basically a hallmark of deeper optimization processes. The marbles fall into an arrangement, technically called the “maximally random jammed packing,” in which they fill 64 percent of space. (The rest is empty air.) This is less than in the densest possible arrangement of spheres—the lattice packing used to stack oranges in a crate, which fills 74 percent of space. But lattice packings aren’t always possible to achieve. You can’t easily shake a boxful of marbles into a crystalline arrangement. Neither can you form a lattice, Torquato explained, by arranging objects of five different sizes, such as the cones in chicken eyes. As stand-ins for cones, consider coins on a tabletop. “If you take pennies, and you try to compress the pennies, the pennies like to go into the triangular lattice,” Torquato said. But throw some nickels in with the pennies, and “that stops it from crystallizing. Now if you have five different components—throw in quarters, throw in dimes, whatever—that inhibits crystallization even further.” Likewise, geometry demands that avian cone cells be disordered. But there’s a competing evolutionary demand for the retina to sample light as uniformly as possible, with blue cones positioned far from other blue cones, reds far from other reds, and so on. Balancing these constraints, the system “settles for disordered hyperuniformity,” Torquato said. Hyperuniformity gives birds the best of both worlds: Five cone types, arranged in near-uniform mosaics, provide phenomenal color resolution. But it’s a “hidden order that you really can’t detect with your eye,” he said. Determining whether a system is hyperuniform requires algorithms that work rather like a game of ring toss. First, Torquato said, imagine repeatedly tossing a ring onto an orderly lattice of dots, and each time it lands, counting the number of dots inside the ring. The number of captured dots fluctuates from one ring toss to the next—but not by very much. That’s because the interior of the ring always covers a fixed block of dots; the only variation in the number of captured dots happens along the ring’s perimeter. If you increase the size of the ring, you will get variation along a longer perimeter. And so with a lattice, the variation in the number of captured dots (or “density fluctuations” in the lattice) grows in proportion to the length of the ring’s perimeter. (In higher spatial dimensions, the density fluctuations also scale in proportion to the number of dimensions minus one.) Now imagine playing ring toss with a smattering of uncorrelated dots—a random distribution, marked by gaps and clusters. A hallmark of randomness is that, as you make the ring bigger, the variation in the number of captured dots scales in proportion to the ring’s area, rather than its perimeter. The result is that on large scales, the density fluctuations between ring tosses in a random distribution are much more extreme than in a lattice. The game gets interesting when it involves hyperuniform distributions. The dots are locally disordered, so for small ring sizes, the number of captured dots fluctuates from one toss to the next more than in a lattice. But as you make the ring bigger, the density fluctuations begin to grow in proportion to the ring’s perimeter, rather than its area. This means that the large-scale density of the distribution is just as uniform as that of a lattice. Among hyperuniform systems, researchers have found a further “zoology of structures,” said the Princeton physicist Paul Steinhardt. In these systems, the growth of density fluctuations depends on different powers (between one and two) of the ring’s perimeter, multiplied by different coefficients. “What does it all mean?” Torquato said. “We don’t know. It’s evolving. There are a lot of papers coming out.” Hyperuniformity is clearly a state to which diverse systems converge, but the explanation for its universality is a work in progress. “I see hyperuniformity as basically a hallmark of deeper optimization processes of some sort,” Cohn said. But what these processes are “might vary a lot between different problems.” Hyperuniform systems fall into two main classes. Those in the first class, such as quasicrystals—bizarre solids whose interlocked atoms follow no repeating pattern, yet tessellate space—appear to be hyperuniform upon reaching equilibrium, the stable configuration that particles settle into of their own accord. In these equilibrium systems, it is mutual repulsions between the particles that space them apart and give rise to global hyperuniformity. Similar math might explain the emergence of hyperuniformity in bird eyes, the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices, and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function—cousins of the prime numbers. The other class is not as well understood. In these “nonequilibrium” systems, which include shaken marbles, emulsions, colloids and ensembles of cold atoms, particles bump into one another but otherwise do not exert mutual forces; external forces must be applied to the systems to drive them to a hyperuniform state. Within the nonequilibrium class, there are further, intractable divisions. Last fall, physicists led by Denis Bartolo of the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon, France, reported in Physical Review Letters that hyperuniformity can be induced in emulsions by sloshing them at the exact amplitude that marks the transition between reversibility and irreversibility in the material: When sloshed more gently than this critical amplitude, the particles suspended in the emulsion return to their previous relative positions after each slosh; when sloshed harder, the particles’ motions do not reverse. Bartolo’s work suggests a fundamental (though not fully formed) connection between the onset of reversibility and the emergence of hyperuniformity in such nonequilibrium systems. Maximally random jammed packings, meanwhile, are a a whole different story. “Can we connect the two physics?” Bartolo said. “No. Not at all. We have absolutely no idea why hyperuniformity shows up in these two very different sets of physical systems.” As they strive to link these threads, scientists have also encountered surprising properties of hyperuniform materials—behaviors that are normally associated with crystals, but which are less susceptible to fabrication errors, more like properties of glass and other uncorrelated disordered media. In a paper expected to be published this week in Optica, French physicists led by Rémi Carminati report that dense hyperuniform materials can be made transparent, whereas uncorrelated disordered materials with the same density would be opaque. The hidden order in the particles’ relative positions causes their scattered light to interfere and cancel out. “The interferences destroy scattering,” Carminati explained. “Light goes through, as if the material was homogeneous.” It’s too early to know what dense, transparent, noncrystalline materials might be useful for, Carminati said, but “there are certainly potential applications,” particularly in photonics. And Bartolo’s recent finding about how hyperuniformity is generated in emulsions translates into an easy recipe for stirring concrete, cosmetic creams, glass and food. “Whenever you want to disperse particles inside a paste, you have to deal with a hard mixing problem,” he said. “This could be a way to disperse solid particles in a very uniform fashion.” First, you identify a material’s characteristic amplitude, then you drive it at that amplitude a few dozen times, and an evenly mixed, hyperuniform distribution emerges. “I should not tell you this for free, but rather start a company!” Bartolo said. Torquato, Steinhardt and associates have already done so. Their start-up, Etaphase, will manufacture hyperuniform photonic circuits—devices that transmit data via light rather than electrons. The Princeton scientists discovered a few years ago that hyperuniform materials can have “band gaps,” which block certain frequencies from propagating. Band gaps enable controlled transmission of data, since the blocked frequencies can be contained and guided through channels called waveguides. But band gaps were once thought to be unique to crystal lattices and direction-dependent, aligning with the crystal’s symmetry axes. This meant photonic waveguides could only go in certain directions, limiting their use as circuits. Since hyperuniform materials have no preferred direction, their little-understood band gaps are potentially much more practical, enabling not only “wiggly waveguides, but waveguides as you wish,” Steinhardt said. As for the pattern of five-color mosaics in birds’ eyes, termed “multihyperuniform,” it is, so far, unique in nature. Corbo still hasn’t pinpointed how the pattern forms. Does it emerge from mutual repulsions between cone cells, like other systems in the equilibrium class? Or do cones get shaken up like a box of marbles? His guess is the former. Cells can secrete molecules that repel cells of the same type but have no effect on other types; probably, during embryonic development, each cone cell signals that it is differentiating as a certain type, preventing neighboring cells from doing the same. “That’s a simple model of how this could develop,” he said. “Local action around each cell is creating a global pattern.” Aside from chickens (the most readily available fowl for laboratory study), the same multihyperuniform retinal pattern has turned up in the three other bird species that Corbo has investigated, suggesting that the adaptation is widespread and not tailored to any particular environment. He wonders whether evolution might have found a different optimal configuration in nocturnal species. “That would be super interesting,” he said. “It’s trickier for us to get our hands on, say, owl eyes.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

"The History of the Slinky. The Slinky may have become a phenomenon, but it was born an accident. Richard James, a naval engineer during World War II, was working with torsion springs when one fell out of a box; he watched in awe as it ""walked"" across a table. He spent the next few years tinkering with coils in search of the slinkiest shape—one that's fully compressed when relaxed. Shopkeepers thought it was too boring for kids used to loud and colorful toys, so James took the marketing into his own hands. He staged a department store demo that sparked a craze, and 72 years later, more than 300 million have been sold. Lots of reasons have been given for the Slinky’s enduring appeal: It's cheap, or it teaches kids physics. But Betty James, who came up with the name for her husband's famous offspring, always knew the secret, which she shared in a 2001 interview. ""Children love simple things,"" she said. They’re not the only ones. | $6 ",0.0
"In search of the Chibok girls and the meaning of their kidnapping.    Jenny Rogers is an assistant editor for Outlook at The Washington Post.   The release of nearly two dozen Nigerian girls last fall seemed a rare flash of good news in the saga of the 2014 Boko Haram kidnappings, when 276 schoolgirls were snatched from the town of Chibok by the Islamic terrorist group. But after the 21 girls were freed, the BBC reported that the former captives weren’t allowed to return to their families for Christmas and instead were forced to stay at a Ni ger ian politician’s house until after the holiday. The government’s meddling in  —   and bungling of  —   the girls’ return outraged the families. What should have been a moment of joy instead provoked new anguish and further fed the narrative that the Ni ger ian government is not up to the task of handling the crisis.   Ni ger ian poet Helon Habila’s tale of the kidnappings, “The Chibok Girls,” arrived too early to capture this latest development, but the botched release of the girls serves as a fitting epilogue to a book focused on the agony of the country and its people in the face of this     abduction.  When Habila traveled to Chibok to meet girls who had earlier escaped their kidnappers, he and his travel companions came upon a terrible bus accident that left a man in a   shirt screaming for help. The travelers stopped, and their driver transported several victims to a hospital, forcing Habila to catch a ride in another car to complete his journey.   A video distributed last August shows an alleged Boko Haram soldier in an unknown location standing in front of a group of girls alleged to be some of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls. (Militant video   Institute via AP)  At first, the incident seems out of place in a text about the Chibok kidnappings and Islamist militancy. But Habila’s book isn’t a news account or a history; his slim volume reads more like a novel that moves through his home country, introducing characters and scenes that don’t appear to advance the story of the missing girls. A fatal bus accident, in its randomness and tragedy, doesn’t tell us about terrorism, but it does tell us something about Nigeria. The narrative weaves and wanders its way to Chibok, both structurally and literally: The author has to take a   detour to get to the town because the most direct route is under Boko Haram control. After numerous checkpoints (which appear to be more about extorting money from travelers than ensuring their safety) Habila arrives in Chibok, but the few girls who had escaped are away at school.  As the poet awaits his encounter with the girls, he ponders his country, the most populous and one of the most educated in Africa. He writes about the Harmattan, a wind that draws Saharan sand into the nostrils and cracks the lips; about Nigerian parents who, less hung up on gender norms than their American counterparts, wrap their baby boys in pink blankets; and about the golden age of Nigeria, the   1970s, when education was free and all graduates were guaranteed a job, before the descent into kleptocracy. Habila doesn’t blame anyone in particular for the violence and disarray that have roiled Nigeria, though he takes a dim view of the past and current presidents, Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari, who have ignored or bungled the response to Boko Haram and the Chibok kidnappings. In 2015, new President Buhari declared victory, “technically,” over the terrorist group on the BBC; his information minister led 33 journalists to areas retaken by the military, boasting that Boko Haram had been so diminished by military might “that the terrorists can no longer hold on to any territory just as they can no longer carry out any spectacular attack. ” Days later, Boko Haram countered with suicide bombings in Madagali and Maiduguri that killed dozens and injured more than 100.  Habila offers a short history of Boko Haram, illuminating the regional, religious and ethnic divisions that help explain its rise. But the author is most concerned with the pain the terrorist organization has inflicted on the country. Chibok, a poor place made miserable by Boko Haram, lacks electricity and running water; soldiers dominate the marketplace, and the town is a target for suicide bombings. The staff of the girls’ school has been questioned by authorities and even accused in editorials of conspiring with the kidnappers. Grief hangs in the air. “It was like going to Hamelin and feeling the weight of the absent boys taken by the Pied Piper,” Habila writes. The terrorist devastation extends far beyond Chibok. Habila passes through ghost towns of burned schools, destroyed bridges and roofless houses with nothing inside but tall grass. He reflects on the 2009 Boko Haram uprising in Maiduguri that left “so many bodies in the streets they had to be brought by dumpster trucks to the mortuary. ” When the mortuary was filled, the dead were piled up in the yard. “The decomposing bodies smelled so bad,” Habila writes, “that people in the neighborhood deserted their homes. ”  The roundup of the Chibok girls has had a profound psychological impact on the community. Since the kidnappings, at least 18 parents have died of   illnesses. A local woman tells Habila that one father said he couldn’t live anymore, knowing that his daughter was a Boko Haram prisoner; he died soon after of heart failure. Another father went missing and was found days later, wandering in the hills, shouting his daughter’s name. The woman tells Habila that the parents walk through the village “as if there was no blood in their bodies. ”  Near the end of the book, Habila finally meets with a few of the escapees. But the conversations, which were anticipated through the entire story, leave the tragedy unresolved. If we hoped to discover the meaning of their country’s ordeal, we can’t help feeling a bit disappointed. The girls, who have told their stories many times, recount their escape in unremarkable,    language. They just decided to leap from a truck after their abduction. They avoided a life of forced marriage and managed not to be recaptured only by sheer luck. Surely, Habila writes, “there had to be something more, some individual act of valor, some unique observation? But there wasn’t. The shocking banality of it. ”  Perhaps making sense of these horrific kidnappings is just as futile as trying to understand a random, fatal bus crash. The best Habila can offer us is his compelling portrait of a troubled land.

"America’s fake news problem predates Facebook.  Fake news has dominated the real news lately, identified as one of the potential causes for the November surprise of Donald Trump’s Electoral College victory. As numerous stories have discussed, a wave of fake news sites cropped up over the past year to spread sensationalized false information via social media, most of which seem driven by the promise of quick profits in exchange for generating   clickbait more than ideological subterfuge.     And due to our tendencies to maintain insular social networks of   communities, and Facebook’s algorithms for both displaying posts and suggesting related links, our social network feeds likely display more “news” that confirms our political beliefs and assumptions, rather than serving up   stories that help inform democratic  . Even Stephen Colbert and John Oliver are blaming Facebook for allowing fake news stories to take root and deceive voters.    Related Facebook’s fake news problem, explained    As Facebook  —   one of the most common ways that Americans consume news stories  —   attempts to reconcile its revealed role in cultivating misinformation and divisiveness, we might be tempted to regard this story as one needing a technological fix: After all, Facebook’s algorithms caused the problem, so they should be able to fix it too. Yet such   obscures the broader context of media and politics that fertilized the ground for many fake news sites to thrive, especially on the right. Fake stories about Hillary Clinton being a murderer emerged from a long legacy of   media that has long pushed against established norms of journalism to spread fear and distrust. Before conservative clickbait took hold,   ideas circulated widely through talk radio and cable news  Contemporary conservative talk radio emerged as a political force in the 1980s, when commentators such as Rush Limbaugh began to dominate AM radio. This was due in part to the 1987 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to stop enforcing the Fairness Doctrine, the policy that required broadcasters to present contrasting viewpoints on controversial topics of public importance. Limbaugh, along with a squad of other conservative hosts, including Neal Boortz, Sean Hannity, and Laura Schlessinger, provided a potent mix of political commentary and entertaining emotional bluster, channeling and escalating anger among conservative listeners who were mostly white, less educated, and outside the coastal cities where most national media originated.     However, as Heather Hendershot argues in her fascinating book What’s Fair on the Air, the history of conservative niche broadcasting actually stretches back much earlier. As early as 1951, wealthy businessmen such as H. L. Hunt, a Texas oil baron, were attempting to forge alternative media structures  —   through books, newsletters, radio shows, and even public access TV  —   that would disseminate conservative views on a variety of issues, ranging from   screeds and diatribes against the United Nations to conspiratorial misgivings about water fluoridation.     Arguably, conservative media pioneers like Hunt even paved the way for Sen. Barry Goldwater’s doomed 1964 presidential run. Hunt took advantage of FCC regulations that mandated all radio and TV broadcasters to devote blocks of their schedules to “public interest” programming. Unlike more recent hosts, Hunt did temper his conservatism by presenting both sides; however, this merely provided cover for him to promote his   views and his opposition to Social Security.  Later, during the 1970s, the fundamentalist Christian radio broadcaster Carl McIntire used conservative media, including his   radio station, WXUR, and his weekly newspaper, The Christian Beacon, to attack his political opponents, including the NAACP, the   League, and other political groups. By 1973, McIntire had his FCC license revoked in response to his   diatribes; however, he continued to distribute his views via pamphlets, books, and other written materials, providing a model for future generations of religious conservatives, including Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network and James Dobson’s Focus on the Family, as well as Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority.     In fact, Falwell helped to promote the 1994 conspiracy documentary The Clinton Chronicles, which alleged that the Clintons were responsible for the deaths of multiple political enemies. More than 300, 000 copies of the film were made, and if your newsfeed skews conservative, many of the film’s allegations  —   including the “Clinton body count” and Bill Clinton’s rape allegations  —   found their way back into   smear campaigns during the 2016 election.  The 1990s also saw the introduction of an online conservative media machine, pioneered by the news aggregator the Drudge Report, which became a   source for many on the right when it was the first source to break the Monica Lewinsky scandal; the site continues to offer   coverage of political scandals that paint Democrats in the worst possible light. For television, the epochal event was the launch of Fox News in the   with the stated goal of offering a corrective to what many people, already conditioned by these legacies of   radio, saw as a biased liberal news media. Like most of the talk radio shows, Fox News relied on   commentary led by its primetime lineup of pundits, including Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, and Glenn Beck. Many of these commentators also had daily radio shows, allowing audiences to ensconce themselves inside a media bubble within which they were presented almost exclusively with conservative perspectives. And the rise of Fox News dramatically changed the course of American journalism in a way that directly led to today’s proliferation of fake clickbait news sites.    Fox News changed the rules of traditional broadcast journalism From its beginning, Fox News broke with many standards typically followed by broadcast journalism. Founded by the accused sexual predator (and recent Trump adviser) Roger Ailes, a longtime Republican media consultant with close ties to elected officials and party leaders, Fox News always had intimate connections with the Republican Party. As its influence rose in the 2000s, it was often said that Fox News functioned as the propaganda arm for the GOP. According to repentant Republican speechwriter David Frum, this relationship inverted by 2010: “Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we’re discovering we work for Fox. ” Regardless of who held the power, such overt strategic connections between a major political party and a major national broadcaster were unprecedented in America and have helped lead to our current circumstances. Fox took many lessons from the history of conservative talk radio, most notably the need to simultaneously entertain an audience while telling them what they most wanted to hear. Combining a bombastic graphic style, an emphasis on emotionally charged debates and pundit monologues, and a penchant for attractive women anchors (which now seems to be of particular interest for Ailes) Fox always sought to entertain its audience  —   as much as, if not more than, informing them on current events.  Today, fans of Fox News flock to its coverage because it confirms their political beliefs in an entertaining package, providing a compelling narrative for conservative viewpoints that often seems missing from mainstream news coverage. One key effect is to create an insular audience where viewers consider themselves to be part of a select community rather than just an audience for a cable channel. The lack of corroboration by outside news sources seems to actually increase trust, as conservative viewers assume that Fox News must be telling the truths that other journalists are too scared or biased to reveal.  The crucial innovation for Fox News that separated it from conservative radio was its framing of   positions and coverage as “news” and not “opinion. ” The channel reiterated its tagline “We Report, You Decide,” offering a way to deflect claims of conservative bias  —   but that slogan also ignores the fact that Fox News actually does very little reporting. The vast majority of its airtime has always been devoted to political commentary, debates between pundits, chatty conversations about news items on shows like Fox & Friends, and anchors reading headlines over footage of staged political events and press conferences. By foregrounding pundits and commentary instead of journalists and reporters actually uncovering new stories, Fox News costs far less to run than its broadcast journalism competitors, an advantage that its competitors have emulated via the growth of   programming and decline in firsthand reporting across all television news. And by relying far less on journalism and original reporting, it evades many of the ethical and journalistic norms that other news outlets follow.     As highlighted by the essential 2004 documentary Outfoxed, Fox newscasters regularly preface their reports with vague citations of “Some people say  …   ” effectively dodging the typical ethical requirement to present factual information by framing claims as potential rumors. Even when presenting information clearly framed as fact, Fox News is prone to misrepresentation and misinformation, as with its long history of misleading and inaccurate graphics.  Indeed, in a direct satire of Fox News, Stephen Colbert identified these tendencies in his very first episode of The Colbert Report in 2005, as he coined the term “truthiness” to refer to information that feels like it should be true rather than actually being truthful. In all of these ways, Fox News continues the long tradition of conservative media affirming the beliefs of its partisan consumers, but takes it a crucial step further by framing its opinions, inaccurate claims, and sensationalist tone as “news,” not commentary. A good example of how Fox News actively participates in the perpetuation and circulation of fake news is the controversy over the Park51 project, which gripped the media and figured in political debates in 2010. However, most people wouldn’t remember much about Park51, because Fox News and other conservative media insisted on calling it by another name: the Ground Zero mosque.  Despite the fact that the proposed Islamic cultural center was not a mosque, nor was it actually at the site of the World Trade Center, Fox News insisted on calling it the Ground Zero mosque as a way of politically slanting its coverage through the tools of fake news: presenting exaggerations and misnomers as truth, offering endless repetition and   and refusing to issue corrections based on fact. Like much of the inaccurate information circulating on Facebook this year, Fox’s approach to presenting information regularly enters this realm of “fake news. ” Facebook is just one element of a conservative media infrastructure that circulates false information framed as fact  The legacies of this   broadcasting bubble have profoundly shaped our current political moment, and Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm is only one small piece of the puzzle. Even before Facebook became a primary source for political news, liberals and conservatives were getting their news from vastly different sources. A 2014 Pew Research Center study found that 78 percent of people who identified as either consistently or mostly conservative got their news from Fox News and mistrusted most other outlets, while liberals were relatively evenly divided in consuming and trusting a range of outlets, such as CNN, NPR, and MSNBC. The Breitbart News Network, founded in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart and led since 2012 by Donald Trump’s newly named chief strategist Stephen Bannon, has built upon the strategies pioneered by   media’s embrace of sensationalized and fake news. The site is regarded as a journalistic enterprise, despite its lack of ethical or factual standards and overt ties to white nationalist groups.     Breitbart notably developed a symbiotic relationship with Trump well before Bannon joined the campaign, helping to recirculate many of the false conspiracy theories that have dogged the Clintons since the 1990s. Breitbart. com, in fact, was a crucial financial supporter of the film adaptation of Clinton Cash, which presented multiple verifiably false claims about the Clinton family’s history of public service. Even more extreme is Infowars, the fearmongering media empire of Trump ally Alex Jones, where   conspiracies flourish and leak into public consciousness via affirmations by other   media and, now, the  .  Breitbart, Infowars, and other comparably questionable distributors of   media have built their brand on presenting sensationalized fake news to their   audience much like the trail blazed by Fox News; unlike Fox, these sites operate successfully without even pretending to be ideologically neutral or journalistically ethical. What these examples suggest is that there is a large infrastructure in place that allows conservative media to circulate and disseminate false information framed as fact. While Facebook can serve as an easy target because of its hypervisibility and its faltering response to the controversies over its newsfeed, it is too simplistic to blame our partisan media culture on a faulty algorithm alone.  As Daniel Kreiss argues at Culture Digitally, decades of fake news emerging from   sources have actively and strategically built toward this moment, each helping to make such circulation of misinformation more and more acceptable. And as Jeet Heer contends at the New Republic, the rise of fake news is meeting a demand from   voters looking for reasons to support their team, rather than information to guide their actions  —   a demand that has been cultivated by decades of conservative news striving to confirm the beliefs of its consumers.  Which brings us to today, where, as opponents of Trump’s candidacy and eventual presidency rally to avoid “normalizing” his ideas and approach, the mainstreaming of conservative fake news is a clear case of the dangers of such normalization. As we increasingly accept inaccurate peddlers of politicized misinformation as “news,” we allow our citizenry to be horrifically misinformed as part of this new normal.

"3 Smart Things About Our Sixth Sense: Interoception. 1. The five traditional senses keep us alert and alive: Hot pans burn, loud noises startle. Within our bodies, a sixth sense, known as interoception, perceives the state of—and threats to—our internal organs. From pangs and cramps to shortness of breath, it warns us when something is off. Hung­over from a wild bender? Waves of nausea in the presence of alcohol are interoceptive warnings to lay off the juice. 2. One easy way to test your interoception is to find a quiet room and try to sense your pulse (without touching an artery). Even babies can perform a version of this.

"You'll Miss the Escape Key Even Less Than Your Headphone Jack. Phil Schiller gave a eulogy today: ""For over 45 years, we’ve been using function keys,"" Apple’s head of marketing said from the stage in Cupertino. ""Or, really, for the last who-knows-how-many years, we haven’t been using them."" So for its new MacBook Pro, Apple killed them—deleted them, in keyboard-speak. In place of the 14 individual keys that sat atop your keyboard, there’s now a lone, skinny, OLED bar—a thin strip of touchscreen that Apple calls the Touch Bar. Unlike anonymous keys, the bar ""knows"" what you’re doing on your laptop and offers up an ever-changing, context-aware range of functionality. If you’re sending emails, Touch Bar will show icons for composing, sending, and responding to emails. If iPhoto is open, photo editing tools will pop up. Significantly, too, Touch ID in the Touch Bar lets you make online purchases in one gesture with Apple Pay. By killing the function keys, Apple may have found a way to give users more function than ever. 'The Touch Bar seems to me like an organic next step for a keyboard.' ",0.0
"Camryn Manheim pushes buttons as steely chief on ‘Major Crimes’. Fans of TNT’s “Major Crimes” and its predecessor, “The Closer,” could experience déjà vu Wednesday night. Camryn Manheim (“The Practice,” “Extant”) joins the cast in the recurring role of LAPD Deputy Chief of Operations Winnie Davis, a    cop who locks horns with Major Crimes Division Captain Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell). It’s a   for Raydor, the former internal affairs head who was originally an antagonist to Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) on “The Closer,” from which “Major Crimes” was spun off in 2012. With the arrival of Davis, viewers will be reminded of the dynamic between Johnson and Raydor. “It was definitely an intentional parallel,” says series creator James Duff. “It’s interesting to have [Raydor] on the other side of that now, to have her sort of in the same situation and see how she deals with it, as opposed to how Brenda dealt with it. The way she struggles to adapt to Winnie is great. ” Part of that struggle is the fact that both Raydor and Davis are in the running to replace Assistant Chief of Special Operations Russell Taylor (Robert Gossett) killed in a courthouse shooting earlier this season. With the victor being in a position to change the other’s career, a power play ensues. “The fierceness of their struggle is based on the future and who gets to control it,” Duff says. For Manheim, a longtime women’  advocate, much of the appeal of her new role is about feminism. “I always love playing female characters in powerful positions because it sets the tone for what women in all walks of life can do,” she says. It turns out the part was   for Manheim. A longtime “The Closer” and “Major Crimes” fan, she reached out to Duff about doing a stint on the show at some point. “Gosh, you get a message like that from Camryn, and what do you do? You write a part. You have to!” Duff says. “She brings steel and an ability to go to a serious place. Just her presence when she walks   she’s a force of nature. She’s unafraid to be disliked. She’s unafraid to play tough. She’s going to show her character warts and all. ” I don’t think Captain Raydor gives Deputy Chief Davis the respect her rank allows. That really, really pisses her off. One particular scene from Wednesday’s episode gives Manheim plenty to work with. Davis pulls Raydor  —   who is dating Lt. Andy Flynn (Tony Denison)  —   from an interrogation to berate her for undermining her authority. “I don’t think Captain Raydor gives Deputy Chief Davis the respect her rank allows. That really, really pisses her off,” Manheim says. When Flynn appears and says Raydor is needed back in the interview room, Davis responds, with a smirk and an unflinching stare, “Go ahead  —   your boyfriend’s calling you. ” Viewers are left to wonder about Davis’ true intent. “Does it mean, ‘You don’t have a full commitment to this department because you have so many other extracurricular activities’?” asks Manheim. “Or does she have a personal vendetta against a captain who’s very   and actually has a personal life and somebody that cares about her? You wonder if that is just   with envy. ” For her part, Manheim has enjoyed exploring her role’s ambiguities as the series  —   which was renewed for a sixth season  —   heads into the final eight episodes of Season 5. “It’s so much more exciting when I can imbue a character with many layers of conflict,” she says. During his chat with The Post, series creator James Duff discussed the potential for the reappearance of two key characters from the past: Serial killer Philip Stroh (played by Billy Burke) and Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick) who first taunted each other on “The Closer. ” Stroh later appeared on “Major Crimes” and was last seen escaping prison and fleeing the country in Season 3. Here’s what Duff had to say:  Not before the end of Season 5, but it is an issue that has not been resolved. Why he would come back  —   that’s a big question that we would have to take some time to run at, some big story time.  Not in the back eight [episodes] here. We have a deal  —   Kyra has a deal with ‘Major Crimes.’ I’ll never say never. It’s a matter of what her schedule is and what our schedule is. And it needs to be   to have Kyra step back in. And it would need to be something incredibly challenging and important. But having said that, there is an   story coming in the next season.  I think you already asked a question about it.  Yes. The Philip Stroh story.  Yes.",1.0
"New Study Shows Bay Area Residents Increasingly Distrust Tech Companies. In conservative circles, the pitchforks have been out for tech since at least the 2016 election season, with far-right media organizations like Breitbart and Project Veritas accusing the industry and its leaders of silencing Republican voices, advocating for open borders, and bankrolling Democratic campaigns. And yet, a new survey suggests that the tech backlash festering on the far-right fringes has also escalated on the industry's largely liberal home turf. According to Edelman’s annual Trust Barometer survey of California, there has been a steep incline in the number of Californians and Bay Area residents calling for stricter regulation of the tech industry over the last year. While tech is still the most trusted industry in the state and around the globe, there is a growing feeling in California and the Bay Area that the tremendous success these companies have had is not helping the average citizen. The outlook is especially grim for social media companies, which Bay Area respondents viewed as the most untrustworthy industry of all, faring even worse than often vilified sectors like big pharma, telecommunications, and financial services.

Tony Moreno was convicted by a jury that deliberated for a short time Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning. The    faces up to 70 years at prison when he’s sentenced in May. Moreno threw    Aaden off the Arrigoni Bridge, which spans the Connecticut River between Middletown and Portland, on July 15, 2015, and then jumped, intending to kill himself, prosecutors said. Moreno, who is from Middletown, spent several days in a hospital. Aaden’s body was found by a kayaker 14 miles downstream two days later. Moreno had a strained relationship with the boy’s mother, prosecutors said. The mother,    Adrianne Oyola, testified that things got worse when she refused his marriage proposal a month before the baby’s death. The two shared custody of Aaden. A police officer and a hospital psychiatrist testified that Moreno made statements indicating he had killed the child. Prosecutors also introduced text messages between Moreno and Oyola as evidence, including one in which in response to a question about Aaden’s whereabouts Moreno wrote: “He’s dead. Soon I will be too. ” A crying Moreno testified in his own defense, saying the baby slipped from his arms and he never intended to harm him.

"Check out this amazing parody Trump inaugural address from 1999. Donald Trump’s   is actually his second  —   if you count   presciently penned by political satirist Christopher Buckley. “My fellow Americans,” the parody begins, sensibly enough. But Buckley’s faux speech quickly careens off the   presidential track  —   into Trumpian bombast, and a few    musings about the Capitol’s mall. “This is a great day for me personally,” the parody Trump tells his public. “You’re very smart to have voted for me because I’m going to do positive things for this country, starting with this mall I’m looking out over. “For starters, I don’t know why this is called a mall. ” “Where I come from, New York City  —   which happens to be the greatest city in the world, and the reason I say that is that I built most of it, and I only build quality, so I think I know what I’m talking about  —   a mall doesn’t look like this. “Where are the shops? I see grass, ponds, an obelisk. This is not Cairo. ” The 1999 version of a newly sworn President Trump goes on in the parody to complain that George Washington wasn’t a good businessman: “You’ve got a    structure sitting on some of the most prime real estate in the country, incredible views, including of my new home. People would pay a lot for a duplex   in a building like that. ” He adds, “Everywhere I look I see wasted opportunities, and I’ve only been president for five minutes. ” “Trump” then promises, “I have no problems with people trading with us, but it’s going to be fair trade, by which I mean we come out on top. Or they can sell their TVs and cheeses to someone else. Maybe North Korea could use them. ” He then rushes off for a “lavish luncheon in the Rotunda. ” “I understand they’re serving a lot of shrimp, much better food than they’ve had in Congress for a long time. ” In an interview Friday morning with NPR, Buckley, the son of lauded conservative William F. Buckley, joked of the speech that “It took 17 years to come true. ” “It seemed funny at the time, but here we are,” said Buckley, who was a speechwriter for Vice President George H. W. Bush. “It’s morning in America, as we say. And ‘morning’ is a word that can be spelled two ways,” Buckley quipped.",1.0
"Battery causes small explosion in city garbage truck. A   battery exploded in a city sanitation truck in Midtown Friday morning, triggering panicked 911 calls from people who heard the blast, officials said. The small explosion occurred about 8:05 a. m. after garbage men tossed a duct taped box into their truck during trash pickup on East 31st Street near Fifth Avenue. When the workers cycled the truck  —   the process where the compactor crushes the waste  —   the box ignited and exploded, according to a Department of Sanitation spokeswoman. People within earshot called 911 to report the blast, the FDNY said. The sanitation workers were able to reverse the cycle and throw the box into a nearby puddle, extinguishing the fire. Authorities later determined the blast was sparked by a   battery inside the box, which wasn’t immediately identified. Soon after the scare, the truck resumed its normal operations.

"Carter Page Surveillance Doesn't Mean Much For Trump. It's easy for all sides to read too much into the news that the FBI reportedly obtained a warrant to surveil former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Those convinced of Trump’s Russia ties may see validation and proof of a grander conspiracy. Others may see this lending credence to Trump’s allegations that the Obama administration ordered illegal, politically motivated surveillance in the heat of last year’s presidential campaign. In truth, it does neither. At least, not yet. In truth, the most important takeaway from this week's Washington Post report has little to do with Trump directly at all. The focus should instead be on one key implication: That Russia didn’t just interfere in the US election; they may have had help from the inside. To obtain a FISA warrant against a US citizen, the intelligence community has to prove that the surveillance is necessary to protect national security. If the report is correct, it indicates there’s a counterintelligence investigation of Carter Page. It doesn’t tell us anything beyond that. ",0.0
"Cigna up in arms over Anthem’s ‘breach’ of agreement. One of the nastiest merger quarrels is about to get uglier. Less than six weeks before health insurance giants Cigna and Anthem are supposed to go to court to defend their $54 billion merger, Cigna is claiming its acquirer breached its agreement, The Post has learned. Cigna is irate because it feels Anthem has not properly prepared its case against the Justice Department, sources close to the situation said. The Justice Department in July sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds. The case goes to trial on Nov. 21. Anthem, America’s   insurer, is   to defend the merger because its executive office lacked direction or leadership, sources said. “It is a fair criticism,” a source close to the case said. “When you turn over control of a company to a buyer, you expect them to have a detailed plan to deal with regulatory concerns through remedies, and not to let it spiral out of control,” the source said. Currently, four of Anthem’s top executives  —   including Chief Executive Joseph Swedish  —   do not work   at the company’s Indianapolis headquarters, a source said, pointing to a reason the company is not prepared. Additionally, two of the four executives who do work in the headquarters started in their positions after the parties signed the merger deal on July 24, 2015. Anthem, meanwhile, is also alleging a breach of the deal by Cigna. The insurer has not provided documentation to regulators in a timely manner, sources said. The merger would create America’s largest health insurer, and that has unnerved the Justice Department. Anthem declined comment for this story, and Cigna did not return calls. Last week, the court recommended that parts of 25 documents sent between the companies be released. The Justice Department believes these documents will show that the proposed merger synergies may not be realized because the companies are not in sync. Part of Cigna’s evidence of its merger partner breaching its agreement is that Anthem did not present the Justice Department with suggestions on how to resolve the conflict of being the parent of   plans and owning Cigna. Anthem is the parent of New York City’s largest “Blue” health insurer. Presently, Anthem works with the Blues to win national accounts from competitors  —   including Cigna. Anthem, after the merger, would be competing with and against the Blues for the same accounts, the Justice Department alleged in its suit. “Anthem’s CEO testified that he did not know how the company would resolve this conflict of interest,” the Justice Department alleged.",1.0
"So Uber Wants Self-Driving Bikes and Scooters. Why? And How?. Really, it was only a matter of time before somebody thought to combine today’s hottest transportation trends: shared electric scooters and autonomous driving. Over the weekend, Uber reportedly unveiled a micromobility robotics division at a robotics meetup in the Bay Area. Though the company declined to confirm or comment on the new addition, the division will reportedly explore how to make the scooters and shared bikes it’s now deploying alongside its cars capable of riding themselves. The key questions, then, are the classic ones—why and how. ",0.0
"Google's AI Wins Pivotal Second Game in Match With Go Grandmaster. SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — After more than four hours of tight play and a rapid-fire endgame, Google's artificially intelligent Go-playing computer system has won a second contest against grandmaster Lee Sedol, taking a two-games-to-none lead in their historic best-of-five match in downtown Seoul. The surprisingly skillful Google machine, known as AlphaGo, now needs only one more win to claim victory in the match. The Korean-born Lee Sedol will go down in defeat unless he takes each of the match's last three games. Though machines have beaten the best humans at chess, checkers, Othello, Scrabble, Jeopardy!, and so many other games considered tests of human intellect, they have never beaten the very best at Go.

"Cyberbullying app at center of probe into teen’s suicide. A    high school soccer player hanged himself after he received insulting messages from bullies on a social media app, according to reports. George Hessay, from Goole, East Yorkshire, UK, was using the Sayat. me website  —   which allows users to post anonymous “feedback” about their friends  —   when he received the offensive comments,  The teen was found hanging on May 10. The site, based in Estonia, was designed for business users seeking “constructive, honest feedback” from colleagues and clients  —   but many of its 30 million users are believed to be teenagers, according to the site. Hessay was a student at the Snaith School, where he played for the Snaith Comets football team. Hessay’s friend Joely Baxter posted a tribute to the teen on Facebook, calling him “such a nice boy who cared about everyone and made sure everyone was OK. ” “He really didn’t deserve what happened to him,” Baxter wrote. “Nobody does and I think that whoever wrote things about him on that stupid Sayat. me thing should be ashamed and grow some balls and own up to it because whoever did it was sick in the head. ” The Snaith Comets team told The Telegraph that Hessay was “a great team player. ” The boy’s death is not being treated as suspicious, a Humberside Police spokesman told The Telegraph. Hanna Talving, the CEO of Sayat. me, told the Telegraph on Thursday that the site was taken offline following Hessay’s suicide. “We have been made aware by police that they are investigating a bullying related suicide and we offer our sincere condolences to those affected by this loss,” she said in a statement. “We deplore bullying of any kind and want it to have no place on our site.

"Funeral for Muslim teen killed in attack near Virginia mosque draws throngs.  The Northern Virginia Muslim community and grieving high schoolers gathered on Wednesday to mourn Nabra Hassanen, a    killed while she was walking to her mosque with friends on Sunday. Dranesville Road, which was largely empty when an attacker beat Nabra there on early Sunday morning, was packed with people walking along the same sidewalk to attend her funeral. In traditional Muslim garb and Western attire, they walked and drove from every direction to All Dulles Area Muslim Society. The mosque in Sterling is where Hassanen and her friends were returning around 4 a. m. Sunday after going to eat at a nearby McDonald’s before their Ramadan fast that would begin at dawn.   [Officials:    girl assaulted and killed after leaving Virginia mosque]           Bright Mylar balloons on Wednesday marked the spot where Nabra was assaulted after a driver in what police have called “road rage” approached the group of teens on their bikes and walking, jumped a curb and as other teens fled, caught up to Nabra in a parking lot after she had fallen behind the others, police have said. Authorities arrested Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, of Sterling, in her killing, after a Fairfax County officer noticing him circling the site Sunday after Nabra had been reported missing shortly after the other teens reached the mosque. Police said Martinez Torres, a construction worker, beat Nabra with a baseball bat and left her body in a pond near his apartment building in Sterling in Loudoun County. Her remains were found Sunday afternoon. Funeral traffic clogged the streets as officers guided mourners who were rapidly filling the parking lot at ADAMS. The brutal assault has alarmed the surrounding Muslim community and reverberated nationally with calls for a hate crime investigation as vigils were held in several major cities. A vigil in Dupont Circle in the District Tuesday night drew hundreds, with another vigil planned in Reston Wednesday night.        (Alice   Washington Post)    [Pressure grows to classify Muslim girl’s slaying as a hate crime]   “We heard about this type of hatred. We never thought it was going to happen in our neighborhood,” said Rhab Saad, who lives in the same apartment complex as the Hassanens and described Nabra as respectful to elderly neighbors and a helpful babysitter of small children. “Muslim kids and Christian kids in this neighborhood grow up together. We’re all family. ” A student at South Lakes High School in Reston, Nabra was known for her enthusiasm for fashion and makeup. Friends said she was always there to listen to them, and she befriended everybody she came across. The night she died, she had just hosted a big group of friends for iftar  —   the Ramadan    dinner  —   at her Reston apartment. The room was packed with teens in Hassanen’s circle, both Muslim and  . When Neshanti Morgan transferred from a private Christian school to Langston Hughes Middle School, she knew next to nothing about Islam. When she befriended Nabra, she said, she was so intrigued by her friend’s religion that she wanted to try fasting for Ramadan. Those school days watching everyone eating in the busy lunchroom while she and Nabra and their other Muslim friends fasted were tough. But Neshanti stuck with it, and gained a lasting appreciation for Islam and for the way Nabra shared her culture with her friends. “She was very, very kindhearted, always smiling, always dancing,” Neshanti, 16, said on Wednesday as she walked into ADAMS, where the funeral prayer service was starting. Amid a huge crowd of mourners, many of them fasting for Ramadan now, Neshanti said Nabra taught her the value of the difficult   practice. “It’s good how they give up food and water,” she said. “I think it brings you closer to the One that you’re worshiping. It’s not about material things. It’s about focusing on Allah or God. ” Rosy Bhuiyan said she prayed alongside Nabra on Sunday morning, just before the teenagers left for McDonald’s.  Bhuiyan, who has worked in food service at South Lakes High School for 24 years, said she got to know Nabra at the mosque, so she was always a friendly face when she came through Bhuiyan’s lunch line. “She would say, ‘salaam aleikum, Auntie,’” Bhuiyan said. “I felt like she’s my daughter. ” Bhuiyan said she has always felt safe walking from ADAMS in her hijab, and she’s rattled that the typical teenage trek to McDonald’s ended in tragedy. “Now they’re scared too. I’m not safe right now, you know, we feel,” she said. “I called my sister. I said, ‘Be careful when you wear the hijab. ’”  Nabra was the oldest of four sisters, all   children of Egyptian immigrants. Her father Mohmoud Hassanen said she was especially close with her younger sisters and her parents. “She used to be like my friend, not my daughter,” he said. “I don’t want any family to feel like what I feel now. It’s too hard. I raised my daughter for 17 years, and somebody took her life for no reason. ”   Nabra’s mother Sawsan Gazzar, wept Sunday as she told her family in Egypt that her daughter had died, asked for prayers. “Please pray for me, please pray for me,” she sobbed in Arabic. “Pray for me that I can handle this   …     I lost my daughter, my first reason for happiness. ” Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh said Tuesday that the criminal case against the suspect would remain in Fairfax and did not rule out pursuing hate crime charges if fresh evidence pointed in that direction. So many mourners arrived Wednesday that some had to find space to pray in the parking lot, following along with the imam’s voice echoing from loudspeakers. Many were teenagers from South Lakes High School, but the vast majority were from the local Muslim community, even many who did not know Nabra but wanted a moment together to mourn their communal loss. “It’s not just a tragedy for the Muslim community. It’s a tragedy for all of us. We lost a    innocent girl who was loved by so many,” said Misha Yasar, who worships at ADAMS and attended the funeral with her husband. Mohamed Ahmed said he wanted the Hassanen family to know they were surrounded by people thinking of them. “I have three daughters. It could happen to anybody. ” And Iman Boshra, whose daughter was one of Nabra’s many friends, remarked in the outpouring of support and concern. “I never saw it like this,” she said. “My kids are scared now. ”  ",-0.5
"Obama defends handling of Russian meddling ahead of election: ‘We handled it the way we should have’.      President Obama said Friday that his administration did not ascribe motives to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 campaign ahead of Election Day because he did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome in favor of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “Anything said by me or anyone in this White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens,” Obama said at a   news conference. “I wanted to make sure everybody understood we were playing this thing straight. That we were not trying to advantage one side or the other. ”  Obama defended his administration’s handling of the investigation into the hacking of private emails from top Democratic Party officials, amid reports that U. S. intelligence officials have concluded that Russian operatives used the stolen materials to try to help Republican Donald Trump win the election. The FBI has now joined the CIA in that assessment. Clinton has cited the stolen emails, which were made public by WikiLeaks, as a factor in her upset loss to Trump, and her former campaign John Podesta blasted the FBI for focusing more aggressively on investigating her use of a private email server than on Russia’s involvement.  Obama emphasized that his administration publicly accused Russian actors of being behind the email theft in early fall and noted that reporters speculated that the disclosure of the private messages was made to embarrass Clinton and other Democrats during a   campaign. The president suggested that the public was free to interpret the motives behind the leaks for themselves. “What we were trying to do was let people know that this had taken place so that if you started seeing some effect on the election, if you were trying to measure why this was happening and how you should consume the information that was being leaked, that you might want to take this into account,” Obama said. “And that was exactly how we should have handled it. Imagine if we had done the opposite. Then it would have become just one more political scrum. ” Obama added that “part of the goal here was to make sure we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was going to take place. ” Obama has pledged to respond to Russia’s actions with punitive measures, but he did not offer more details about when or how he might do so. Obama suggested that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin knew about the hacking, and he said he warned Putin to ”cut it out” during an international summit in the fall. The president said he did not denounce Russia more forcefully in public leading up to the election because he did not think that would have any effect. ”Folks out there who somehow suggest that if we went out there and made a big comment and thumped our chest about a bunch of stuff, that somehow that would potentially spoke the Russians?” he said. ”The idea that public shaming is going to be effective doesn’t read the thought process in Russia very well.” Obama noted that Trump has been complimentary of Putin and he expressed frustration at Republican leaders who have refrained from criticizing Russia since Trump’s victory. The president cited a poll from the Economist and YouGov that said 37 percent of voters approved of Putin. ”The former head of the [Soviet spy agency] KGB,” Obama said. ”Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave at how that happened.”  ",-0.5
"Congressman: Charlotte protesters ‘hate white people because white people are successful’.          For several years now, as demonstrators across the country have poured into the streets, there has been little doubt about their chief motivation: Outrage over the killings of unarmed black Americans at the hands of   law enforcement agencies. But Rep. Robert Pittenger ( . C.) isn’t buying it. A white American male born in 1948, the lawmaker says he understands the motivations of young, African American protesters better than they do. “The grievance in their minds  —   the animus, the anger  —   they hate white people, because white people are successful and they’re not,” Pittenger told BBC Newsnight when he was asked about what is driving heated protests in Charlotte. “It is a welfare state,” he added. “We have spent trillions of dollars on welfare, and we’ve put people in bondage, so they can’t be all that they’re capable of being. ”   [Charlotte police won’t make shooting video public; chief says footage is not ‘definitive’]   Pittenger, who is serving his second term in Congress, represents North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District and is a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. His district includes portions of Charlotte, where violent protests exploded after local police fatally shot a black man, Keith Lamont Scott  —   putting the city on a growing list of communities across the country that have erupted amid a growing debate on racial bias in policing. His comments drew the ire of local politicians and the state’s Democratic Party, which labeled his remarks “racist,” according to the News & Observer. “These comments are inexcusable,” North Carolina Democratic Party Executive Director Kimberly Reynolds said. “At a time when we need calm and understanding while we learn more about the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, Congressman Pittenger is fanning the flames of hate with his racist rhetoric. This sort of bigotry has become all too common under the party of Donald Trump. Our great state should not be represented by someone who would make such hateful comments. “Congressman Pittenger must apologize, and Gov. [Pat] McCrory and every Republican leader in this state should denounce this hateful rhetoric immediately. ”   @GrierMartin @RaleighReporter I agree with you, Grier, and I’m afraid it wasn’t a misquote.  —   Rep. Chuck McGrady (@ChuckMcGrady) September 22, 2016   Friday morning, after a night of peaceful protests in Charlotte, “Hate White People” was trending on Twitter.      The third night of protests in Charlotte, N. C. stayed peaceful despite continuing past the city’s midnight curfew. Protesters have been demonstrating since Tuesday, when police fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott, and one injured protester has died. (Reuters)   Hours after BBC Newsnight posted its interview, Pittenger posted a “heartfelt response” on his website, along with a series of corresponding tweets.

They certainly weren’t meant in the context of how many viewed them. ” The congressman said he simply was quoting what he’d heard protesters saying. “Do you believe that protesters hate white people?” host Don Lemon asked. “No, sir, it’s the comments that they made  —   if you go back and look at the tapes, the comments they made on air,” Pittenger said. “I was only trying to convey what they were saying, and yet it didn’t come out right, and I apologize.   …     That certainly is not the spirit of who I am. ” “Let’s walk through what you said,” Lemon went on. “You said, ‘They hate us  —   they hate us because we’re successful, they hate white people because we’re successful.’ How is that taken out of context, with all due respect?” “What I’m trying to communicate was, what has occurred with the economy has left them out,” the congressman said. “Was this a learning point for you at all?” Lemon asked. “I love my community,” Pittinger said. “I am very sorry for how I said what I said. My desire is everyone could grow up the economic ladder and have the greatest benefit of the American opportunity. ” He added: “I’ve come on the air to apologize in every way I can. ” This post has been updated.

"The Republican party just had a nightmare moment on the convention floor.        For weeks, rumors that rump Republicans dissatisfied with the idea of Donald Trump as the party’s presidential nominee would stage a protest vote swirled. On Monday, those disgruntled Republicans made good on their pledge  —   sort of. The fight happened just after 4 p. m. eastern  —   three hours after the convention was gaveled in on its first day. At issue was the approval of the rules package that sets the parameters for the   convention.   forces tried to push through the package on a voice vote. Then this happened:   ROLL CALL VOTE! !!! pic. twitter.   —   Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) July 18, 2016   ”Roll call vote” was the chant of the   forces, a desire to have each state, one by one, announce their support or opposition not only for the rules package but, more broadly, for Trump. Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack was  —   unfortunately for him  —   tasked with overseeing this chaos.  The first time he tried to declare that the ”ayes” ( ) votes had it, he was shouted down and left the stage.  Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a leading voice of the   movement, called that decision to flee ”surreal” and admitted that he had no idea what would come next. What came next was a return  by Womack to the stage and a repetition of the voice vote. After declaring that the ”ayes” had it (again) Womack noted that only six of the nine states demanding a roll call vote had stood firm.  Seven states were needed. And, scene.

The images of unhappy Republicans shouting for a chance to show their dissatisfaction with Trump and then walking out makes for just the sort of images out of this week that Republicans were hoping to avoid.    There were raucous scenes at the Republican National Convention July 18, as angry delegates who disagreed with a rules committee decision backing Donald Trump demanded a role call vote. (The Washington Post)   It showed, powerfully and with the eyes of the national media watching, that the idea that the GOP was rapidly uniting behind Trump is a pipe dream. And that divisions  —   real and serious ones  —   remain, no matter the rhetorical attempts to paper them over. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, once a potential Trump VP, took the stage soon after the eruption.  She spent her time touting the party’s unity and the inclusive process of building the party platform.

"In 2014, Steve Bannon explained his worldview. This year, he helped craft a visa ban that fit it..  On Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House to decry President Donald Trump’s sweeping executive order banning Syrian refugees and visa holders from seven   nations. But at times, the crowd chants switched from criticizing Trump to “Stop President Bannon!”    Trump may have signed the executive order, but critics have gleaned that the policy’s severity was the work of his chief strategist Steve Bannon, formerly an executive at Breitbart  —   an   platform for the views of  .  Bannon has reportedly gained unprecedented sway in the White House, not only shaping policy but also taking a formal seat on the National Security Council. To those familiar with Bannon’s ideology, it’s clear that Trump’s executive order fits snugly into his worldview. Two years ago at a conference at the Vatican, Bannon declared a crisis of both global economy and moral standing. Now that he’s become one of the most powerful men in the country, his remarks are worth reexamining.    At the conference, Bannon said that godlessness and libertarianism have “sapped the strength of the   West to defend its ideals,” and the Muslim world is growing in numbers. “Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act,” he said.     BuzzFeed first published the transcript of Bannon’s remarks in November. At the conference, hosted by the Human Dignity Institute and attended by some of Europe’s most conservative religious voices, Bannon made a case for an international populist conservative movement, explained what he believes are the biggest dangers facing the Christian world, and downplayed the roles racism and bigotry often play in similar fringe,   movements. Here are 10 key passages from the transcript of Bannon’s remarks, which frame a worldview that is already shaping the Trump administration’s first executive moves  —   and what they tell us about the man who spent years mainstreaming white nationalism.    1) Bannon says: We are in an era of global economic crisis Bannon believes in a golden era of economic prosperity; a period in the   century  —   the Pax Americana  —   as a time of peace in the Western Hemisphere. But since the fall of the Soviet Union, he says, the world has come off track, and what has ensued is a crisis in capitalism:  The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave us the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support, whether it’s the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and eventually to take back continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric empire in the Far East. That capitalism really generated tremendous wealth. And that wealth was really distributed among a middle class, a rising middle class, people who come from really   environments and created what we really call a Pax Americana. It was many, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we’ve come partly offtrack in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we’re starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism.  This “enlightened capitalism” has been replaced with a “disturbing” form of “libertarian conservatism,” Bannon explains:    It is a capitalism that really looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost  —   as many of the precepts of Marx  —   and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger generation [that] they’re really finding quite attractive. And if they don’t see another alternative, it’s going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of “personal freedom. ” The idea of a golden era resonates with Trump’s rise: He made the tagline of his political ascendance “Make America Great Again,” harking back to an undefined period of great wealth. The motto led many on the left  —   including President Barack Obama  —   to question which era Trump was referring to with his “again,” pointing out the immense social and cultural strides that have been made since the Pax Americana era began.  2) The best capitalist leaders held   beliefs There is a religious and moral underpinning to Bannon’s understanding of economic prosperity and “enlightened capitalism. ” In other words, the golden era of capitalism he speaks of  —   when the Western world was enjoying an abundance of wealth and peace  —   was dictated by   ideals: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the   West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active participants in the Christians’ faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that’s incredibly important and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today  —   I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don’t believe that our forefathers had that same belief.   ideals have a long history in conservative movements, from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan, emphasizing the importance of traditional American religious values in all aspects of life. The notion feeds the image of a simpler and more homogeneous nation, which Trump largely signaled to throughout his campaign. 3) The secular and Muslim worlds have put the   West in crisis Therefore, Bannon’s “crisis of capitalism,” as he talks about earlier in his remarks, is paired with a crisis of faith  —   a weakening of   ideals, brought on by the recent popularity of secularism and the growth of the Muslim world.    Bannon sees secularism as a crisis among younger generations: With “younger people, especially millennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration. ” That tendency, as well as the rise of Eastern religion, has weakened the pillars of Western ideals, Bannon believes:  I certainly think secularism has sapped the strength of the   West to defend its ideals, right? If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the   West and its tenets, oftentimes, particularly when you deal with the elites, you’re looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was  —   and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them  —   we have to face a very unpleasant fact. And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global. It’s going global in scale, and today’s technology, today’s media, today’s access to weapons of mass destruction, it’s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today.  Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven   nations and the “othering” of Muslim American communities is not too far a leap from these remarks. Trump’s insistence upon looking at Islam with the utmost skepticism implies an    mentality between most Americans and Muslim Americans. 4) These crises have given way to ISIS The byproduct of these crises in   faith and capitalism “converges” on ISIS, Bannon says. “We are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it,” he said:  If you look at what’s happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if you look at the sophistication of which they’ve taken the tools of capitalism. [. ..] They have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a “river of blood” if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is going to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it’s going to come to Western Europe, it’s going to come to the United Kingdom. And so I think we are in a crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we’re now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.     Trump has not only maintained this rhetoric  —   asserting that the incompetence of the left led to the rise of ISIS (Trump even once wrongly claimed Obama was the “founder” of ISIS)  —   but has also acted on it with his visa ban. 5) ISIS is the biggest threat, and the   West needs to stand up against it Bannon’s conclusion on much of this is the need to again strengthen the   stronghold against, most importantly, ISIS, but also what he implies are the creeping ideals of the East, or Islam:  I believe you should take a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive, and that’s fine. If you look back at the long history of the   West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places.   …     It bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West.  Trump has made numerous efforts to heighten the fear of ISIS and terrorism since he began campaigning  —   even as Americans’ direct threat of terrorism is vanishingly small. His promise to make Americans safe again, which has manifested in sweeping policy that restricts Muslim migration to the United States and in extreme calls for increased surveillance on Muslim communities, could very easily be interpreted as the execution of Bannon’s call for a   pushback. 6) The populist uprising is driven by economic anxiety There has been a lot of talk this election about the ideas behind Trump’s rise and whether they stemmed from economic anxiety or racial resentment. The two are clearly not mutually exclusive. Bannon, however, explained it as a byproduct of the 2008 bailouts:  So you can understand why   people having a tough go of it making $50 or $60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to pay for government sponsored bailouts, what you’ve created is really a free option. You say to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the upside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with stock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because   people are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars. And that’s what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the Midlands of England, or whether it’s in Middle America. And I think people are fed up with it.     This populist revolt fell behind Trump this year. He was able to energize the white working class, a contingent of voters that largely led his victories in states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. 7) Bannon has seen incremental Tea Party success throughout the years  The strength of what were once fringe movements has proved shocking to many. But Bannon has been seeing their growing strength for years, arguing that even while losing in the election, the need to address Tea Party concerns has become increasingly visible in Washington:  And I think that’s why you’re seeing  —   when you read the media says, “tea party is losing, losing elections,” that is all BS. The elections we don’t win, we’re forcing those crony capitalists to come and admit that they’re not going to do this again. The whole narrative in Washington has been changed by this populist revolt that we call the grassroots of the tea party movement. And it’s specifically because those bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn’t make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people  —   by the way, and these are people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the finest institutions in the West. They should have known better.  Bannon’s own Breitbart may be the best articulation of the smaller successes. This year,   media outlets entered the mainstream, and as Bannon explained, these ideas, once only shared by the fringe, have been mainstreamed to the White House. 8) In 2014, Bannon said conservative populism would take over the world These remarks were given long before Trump’s rise or the passing of Brexit. But in 2014, Bannon saw a shifting tide globally, a brand of conservative populism taking hold: And that   revolt is really a global revolt. I think you’re going to see it in Latin America, I think you’re going to see it in Asia, I think you’ve already seen it in India. Modi’s great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think this is a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is reporting that throughout the world.    Breitbart found its niche with these “working” people, Bannon said, pairing it with social conservatism:  We’re the voice of the   movement, the voice of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we’re winning victory after victory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a platform of which they can use. [. ..] I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States and Latin America don’t believe that. They believe they know what’s best for how they will comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how to educate their families. So I think you’re seeing a global reaction to centralized government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington, DC, or that government is in Brussels.   Bannon was right to cue a change in tide; conservative populist movements have been gaining steam globally, whether with the Brexit win in the United Kingdom, Trump’s rise in the US, or the Front National in France. But each of these   movements has also been paired with strong racial resentments and xenophobic tendencies, which Bannon’s understanding of the working and “socially conservative” right seems to leave out. 9) He believes racism and nativist beliefs have been “washed out” in the   On multiple occasions, Bannon was asked to comment on the racist undertones  —   and at times explicit overtones  —   of these   populist movements. He answered once, downplaying the role racism plays in the movement. “I think when you look at any kind of revolution  —   and this is a revolution  —   you always have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you’ll see more of a mainstream   populist movement,” he said.  In other words, there will always be the more extreme factions of a movement  —   but racism and nativism are “washed out” on the whole, he said:    It seems that they have had some aspects that may be   or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this, and we’ve been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc. which it’s not. But there’s always elements who turn up at these things, whether it’s militia guys or whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind of washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the margins I think get marginalized more and more. Of course, as we have seen throughout both the movements in the United Kingdom with the Brexit referendum and Trump’s rise, racial anxiety and xenophobia have played central roles  —   and have often translated to objectively discriminatory policy proposals like, the Muslim registry. 10) He also believes Putin is a kleptocrat  —   with good leadership ideas Two years before Trump’s presidential victory, and a campaign during which Trump openly complimented Russian strongman Vladimir Putin’s leadership qualities, Bannon summed up Putin similarly, calling him a strong traditionalist leading an important nationalist movement:  I’m not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the   West really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes  —   particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism  —   and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it’s what can see us forward. You know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something that we have to be very much on guard of.   Putin had a central role in the American election  —   he was an open supporter of Trump, and Russia was at least somewhat involved in attempting to meddle in the democratic process. Bannon’s understanding of him is in line with both these realities: that he has leadership qualities Trump seems to admire, and that he is a   dictatorial leader. ",-1.0

"Boomers need booze and drugs to get through the day. Being wasted to a debilitating degree is not just for giddy millennials.   “baby boomers are drinking themselves into an early grave. ”  Especially if they are well off.   that boomers with decent incomes are particularly inclined to  . According to a story published by NPR, Bob Brewer, head of the Alcohol Program at the CDC, believes that   are just getting going. “Our data supports the notion that people drink well into the senior years,” he says, “and as a society we haven’t done much to address it. ”  A US government study from 2012 supports that assertion. Authors of the study estimated that the number of adults above the age of 50 who will need treatment for drug and alcohol addiction will increase from 2. 8 million between 2002 and 2006 to 5. 7 million by 2020.  David W. Oslin, MD, a behavioral health expert at University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine has   that “binge drinking and prescription drug use are particular concerns in this [ ] population. ” The drug and drink blast comes due to the olds feeling sad and lonely as the years pile up on them. In fact, “it’s quite common for older adults to drink and to suffer from depression at the same time,” Oslin told Drug Free. “Many of them are on antidepressants, but that won’t help them stop drinking. They need an   approach to get better. ” In case young druggies and drunks think it’ll be fun to silently goof on the boomers as they recall getting stoned to Pink Floyd and drinking Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to   radio, the kids are out of luck. According to Oslin, “Many older adults don’t want to go to group therapy with younger adults, but they will go to individualized therapy or to groups with peers. ” And it goes beyond “Mad Men”  boozing.   since 1993 marijuana use has become 10 times more popular for baby boomers. Closer to home, a report referenced in High Times estimates that more 110 million Americans over the age of 50 are enjoying their weed.  As a    retired school teacher told the magazine, “I smoked for years before I had my kids, then stopped. Now they’re gone and I am free to do what I want again . . .

"France’s election reveals a new political divide.           True to the spirit of 1789, the revolutionary French are a step ahead of everyone else. On Sunday, they became the first large Western country to ditch, in a major election, the       structure that has dominated European politics since the Second World War. Neither Emmanuel Macron nor Marine Le Pen, the two candidates who emerged from the first round of voting for the French presidency, belongs to the old gauche or the old droite. Neither will have a major parliamentary party behind his or her program. Neither, as president, would represent a continuation of the status quo. If the most important political divide, in France as almost everywhere else, was once over the size of the state, the new political divide is not really about economics at all. It is about different visions of the identity of France itself. Le Pen, best described as a national socialist, would like to take France out of international institutions, including both the European Union and NATO; block borders; curtail trade; and impose     economics. Her voters are pessimistic about the present and nostalgic for a different France. Her most important foreign ally is Vladimir Putin, whose money funded her campaign, but in recent days President Trump has made positive noises about her, too. Her party, the National Front, has been part of French politics for decades, and has been historically noisy in its opposition to immigration. On the other side is Macron, whose   movement, En Marche  —   the name means “forward”  —   represents the   radical center. Macron rejects political branding: “Honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist,” he has said, despite having served in a Socialist Party government. He embraces markets, but says he believes in “collective solidarity. ” His voters are more optimistic about the future, they support the European Union, they embrace France’s integration with the rest of the continent and the world: “You are the new face of French hope,” Macron told them in his victory speech Sunday night. Though Macron favors strong external borders of the European Union, he expresses no special dislike of immigrants. The foreign politician he most resembles is the young Tony Blair, who also put together a centrist coalition, though it wasn’t called that at the time. In this sense, the second round of France’s election has a clear agenda: open vs. closed, integrationist vs. isolationist, future vs. past. Unlike her father, who won 18 percent in the second round of the presidential election in 2002, Marine Le Pen is expected to win more, maybe much more, in the May 7 runoff. Though she is far behind Macron right now, a fluke victory cannot be excluded. There is a part of the old left, including those who voted for the Trotskyist,   Mélenchon, who sympathize with her objections to trade, bankers and international business; there is a part of the old right, including those who voted for François Fillon, who prefer her ostentatious endorsement of “traditional values. ” There are many who, confused by the new political divide, will abstain. The smear campaign that will now be aimed at Macron  —   backed by Russian,   and   trolls  —   is going to be unparalleled in its viciousness. It may well put people off voting altogether. Whatever the final result, Le Pen and her party will not go away. They stand for a set of feelings that are real, that exist in every Western country, and that are now best fought openly, point by point, argument by argument  —   for they pose a genuine and powerful threat to liberal democracy as we know it. Though the origins of the National Front are indeed fascist  —   its founders included Vichy sympathizers  —   it is no good dismissing her candidacy on those grounds. The task now, for Macron and those who will now imitate him, is to find solutions for the many people who reject his “open” politics and his centrist vision. Security for the fearful; safety for those who feel threatened, whether by immigration or unemployment; dynamism for static economies. On Sunday night, Le Pen called on French “patriots” to support her in the second round. In response, Macron must now define new forms of patriotism, and new forms of solidarity, for those in France who want to remain French but embrace the world.",-0.5
"Viacom CEO defends his job as Redstone ramps up attack. Embattled Viacom CEO   insists he’s “driving value” for investors as controlling shareholder   ratcheted up calls for his ouster. The New York media giant on Thursday reported lackluster results for the latest quarter amid an escalating battle for control of the company that pits Dauman against Redstone’s National Amusements Inc. When asked whether the feud was distracting him from the company’s    performance, Dauman was quick to play down concerns. “Obviously, it is somewhat of a distraction,” Dauman acknowledged during a call with analysts, but said he was not “deterred from pursuing strategic initiatives,” including his plan to sell a 49 percent stake in the Paramount film studio. NAI seized the opportunity to blast Viacom’s management for poor performance. “Viacom’s overall performance continues to highlight the need for changes to leadership at the company,” NAI said in a statement. “In recent years, the company’s senior management has overseen a steep erosion of revenue growth, earnings, operating performance, financial capacity and shareholder returns. ” The latest volley extends a feud that began in May with the removal of Dauman from the trust and the board of NAI, the de facto holding company for Viacom and CBS. The corporate drama intensified in June with NAI’s move to oust five Viacom directors, including Dauman, as lawsuits proceeded in three states. NAI argued that Dauman should go, citing a   decline of more than 50 percent in the company’s stock price compared with a median decline of 12 percent for industry peers. The CEO is challenging NAI, arguing that    Redstone lacked the mental capacity to orchestrate the boardroom coups at NAI and Viacom and that he’s being unduly influenced by his daughter, Shari Redstone. While Viacom’s profit tumbled 29 percent, the results weren’t as bad as some feared and the company managed to beat expectations for its top and bottom line. Adjusted earnings per share of $1. 05 topped the consensus estimate of $1. 02. Revenue of $3. 1 billion was up 2 percent from the   quarter, and exceeded the expects for $3 billion. Drexel Hamilton analyst Tony Wible considered the results cold comfort, however. “Any actions taken by Sumner Redstone (if upheld in court) would not quickly resolve Viacom’s secular headwinds unless Viacom was forced to merge with CBS,” he wrote in a note to investors. In its statement, NAI contrasted the headwinds confronting Viacom to the compensation of its leadership. “Dauman is the third highest paid CEO in the United States and among the worst as measured by pay for performance,” it said. “Including his pre‐negotiated `golden parachute,’ he stands to receive almost a half billion dollars for a tenure that has seen the marked decline of one of the nation’s greatest media companies. ” Viacom stock held steady throughout the morning’s developments, rising 0. 1 percent, to $44. 04 per share, in midday trading.",1.0
"Yale renames Calhoun College because of historic ties to white supremacy and slavery.        NEW HAVEN, Conn.  —   Yale University will rename one of its residential colleges, replacing the name of an alumnus remembered as an advocate of slavery with that of an alumna who was a pioneering mathematician and computer scientist who helped transform the way people use technology. “The minute that the announcement came out, people stuck their heads out of the window and yelled ‘Wahoo! ’” said Julia Adams, a sociology professor who is head of the   Grace Murray Hopper College. The decision to rename Calhoun College reverses one made last spring, when Yale President Peter Salovey said he did not want to erase history, but confront it and learn from it.   [Yale keeps the Calhoun name despite racial concerns, but ditches the ‘master’ title]   Colleges across the country  —   as well as other institutions, cities and legislative bodies  —   have wrestled with similar questions, as they consider monuments to the past in the context of modern life. Racial tensions and protests have intensified those debates in many places, as well as anger from some about “political correctness” forcing schools to whitewash history. At Harvard Law School, officials replaced a shield that was the family crest of slave owners. At the University of North Carolina, officials renamed a hall that had honored a leader of the Ku Klux Klan. At Princeton, university leaders chose not to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson as protesters had demanded, instead pledging to be transparent about his failings, such as his support for segregation, as well as his achievements leading the university and the country.   [Princeton will take steps to expand diversity efforts, and keep Wilson name on buildings]   Salovey said Saturday that he still believes in the importance of confronting history rather than erasing it. But a committee led by a historian crafted a set of four principles for considering renaming  —   starting with a strong presumption against it, but establishing a means for evaluating the idea in exceptional circumstances, such as when the principal legacy of the person is fundamentally at odds with the values of the institution. That was true of U. S. Vice President John C. Calhoun, Salovey said, “a white supremacist, an ardent defender of slavery as ‘a positive good,’ someone whose views hardened over the course of his life, who died essentially criticizing the Declaration of Independence and its emphasis on all men being created equal   …     “I think we can make this change without effacing history. We’re not removing evidence of John C. Calhoun from our campus. ” By the beginning of the next academic year, the name of alumna Grace Murray Hopper will be added to the building, and the residential college will be known by that name. Students’   will have the Hopper name. They won’t chisel off the “Calhoun” or remove other traces of him on campus. They have removed   windows from the college  —   one of which portrayed enslaved people picking cotton  —   and will display them elsewhere with an explanation of the historical context.   [Yale dishwasher resigns after smashing ‘racist, very degrading’ stained glass window in Calhoun College]   The legacy of Calhoun, who graduated from Yale in 1804 and 1822 and served as a U. S. vice president, secretary of state, secretary of war and senator, becoming an influential champion of slavery, had been debated at the school over the years. But those discussions turned to urgent pleas in 2015 after a white man who revered the Confederacy fatally shot nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, S. C. That led South Carolina lawmakers to take down the Confederate flag that had long flown at the state Capitol, and efforts at Yale and elsewhere to stop honoring the name of Calhoun and other people associated with slavery and white supremacy. That fall, protests over racial issues erupted on campus, and Salovey promised changes, including a more diverse faculty and a new center for studies of race and ethnicity. But university leaders resisted demands to drop the Calhoun name.   [‘We failed you,’ Yale’s president tells minority students, amid national conversation about race]   Last spring, Salovey said in a letter to the campus community that deleting the name “might allow us to feel complacent or, even,  .   …     Retaining the name forces us to learn anew and confront one of the most disturbing aspects of Yale’s and our nation’s past. I believe this is our obligation as an educational institution. ”    A photograph of John C. Calhoun (courtesy of Yale University)    But in August, he asked a committee to establish principles to guide university leaders when considering renaming. They concluded with four things to think about: Whether the principal legacy of the person is fundamentally at odds with the university’s mission; whether that legacy was debated during the person’s life; why the person was honored by the university; and whether the building has an important role in creating community on campus. “In considering these principles,” Salovey said in a letter to the university Saturday, “it became clear that Calhoun College presents an exceptionally strong case  —   perhaps uniquely strong  —   that allows it to overcome the powerful presumption against renaming. ” He quoted another graduate  —   the namesake of another residential college at Yale  —   who denounced Calhoun’s legacy even as he mourned his death, writing that he “in a great measure changed the state of opinion and the manner of speaking and writing upon this subject in the South, until we have come to present to the world the mortifying and disgraceful spectacle of a great republic  —   and the only real republic in the world  —   standing forth in vindication of slavery, without prospect of, or wish for, its extinction. If the views of Mr. Calhoun, and of those who think with him, are to prevail, slavery is to be sustained on this great continent forever. ” Salovey said: “This principal legacy of Calhoun  —   and the indelible imprint he has left on American history  —   conflicts fundamentally with the values Yale has long championed. Unlike other namesakes on our campus, he distinguished himself not in spite of these views but because of them. ” A group of advisers asked to consider the issue unanimously concluded that the name should be changed, and the Yale Corporation voted Friday in agreement.    Grace M. Hopper, a retired Navy rear admiral, died in 1992. (Courtesy of Yale University)  The Corporation considered alternatives from a shortlist of the hundreds of names recommended by many students, alumni, faculty and others, and chose Grace Murray Hopper, who had been endorsed by the most people as reflective of Yale’s core values. Adams, who said students rushed to her house to celebrate as soon as the announcement was made, credited students with having an effect on not just the Hopper name but also on one of the new residential colleges slated to open in the fall, which honors civil rights activist Pauli Murray. Adams said she was delighted at Hopper’s name as well. “She was an amazing woman  —   her work in the sciences, her dedication to her country through serving in the military, her personal wit and so many things about her make her an absolutely wonderful choice. ” Elisia   a junior, was celebrating the name change with fellow students in Hopper College on Saturday afternoon, but she said she was disappointed in the way the Yale administration handled a “long,   and exhausting” renaming. She said the college should have honored a black person given the history of racism attached to the Calhoun name. Senior Lindsey Hogg said that during the debates about Calhoun, she had advocated for Henry Roe Cloud, the first Native American to graduate from Yale. Another popular option was Roosevelt Thompson, an African American graduate of Yale known for his academic achievements and dedication to public service. But Hogg, like many other students, said she was excited about Hopper. “No matter how you look at this, it’s a win,” she said. “Yale did the right thing, finally. ” She said she was proud to be in the first class to graduate with the Hopper name. An email from Jonathan Holloway, the dean of Yale College, to students Saturday afternoon said the official name change will be July 1, but that students were welcome to begin using the new name immediately. School officials will be talking about how to proceed with the name change through the diploma ceremony this spring, he said. Calhoun College alumni can change their affiliation to Hopper if they wish, or retain the Calhoun name. Students are randomly assigned to one of a dozen, soon to be 14, residential colleges at Yale, which create smaller communities and often strongly held identities within the large research university. So the name itself, while symbolic, has a depth of meaning and enduring memories connected with it for many students and graduates. Holloway said Saturday that he’s happy to have the decision made so that people can move on. He said Hopper was a great choice that people will celebrate  —   and he’s also bracing for messages from some prominent alumni who have opposed the change “who are going to go berserk about this. ” He served on the committee that determined the principles for consideration of renaming and said they were very clear that times change and sensitivities change. “Just as we look back at the decision in the 1930s to name the college after Calhoun with bewilderment,” he said they recognize that at some point in the future, people will say of the decision to change the name, “‘What were they thinking? ’” Over time, he said, “the notion of who’s a Yalie has changed radically,” with a student body far more diverse in every way. “We need to be aware of that. Not to say we must always change with the wind blowing different directions, not at all. We just need to be mindful of the significance of these changes. At some point there may be an overwhelming sense that something is out of sync with our foundational values. ” Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice for the Center for Community Change, one of four New Haven activists arrested in a Change the Name rally Friday, said: “For those of us who put our bodies on the line yesterday, today feels like a sweet vindication. We are just happy that Calhoun’s name will no longer disgrace the city and the university. ” Salovey, in an interview, said he was thrilled by the choice of Hopper, who earned her doctorate in mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale in 1934. She left her teaching role at Vassar during World War II to enlist in the U. S. Navy, using math to fight fascist enemies. Her work on the earliest computers and computer languages made it possible to write programs for multiple machines simultaneously, to use   languages allowing   to use computers for the first time and dramatically expanding the ways computers could be used. She was a   of the business language COBOL. Hopper was recalled to active service in the Navy at the age of 60, and retired as a rear admiral when she was 79. She was honored many times, including posthumously with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In his letter to the campus community, Salovey called her a visionary, and wrote, “At a time when computers were bulky machines limited to a handful of research laboratories, Hopper understood that they would one day be ubiquitous, and she dedicated her long career to ensuring they were useful, accessible, and responsive to human needs. ”    Grace Hopper. (Courtesy of the Computer History Museum)  Her principal legacy, he said, “is all around us.   …     Grace Murray Hopper College thus honors her spirit of innovation and public service while looking fearlessly to the future. ”   [Grace Murray Hopper, retired Navy rear admiral and legendary pioneer computer scientist, has died]   When she died in 1992, her obituary in The Washington Post noted she had a very strong dislike of intellectual conventions, symbolized by a clock in her office in the Naval Data Automation Command that ran counterclockwise. She once told a reporter, “‘the only phrase I’ve ever disliked is, ‘Why, we’ve always done it that way.’ “‘I always tell young people, go ahead and do it. You can always apologize later. ’” Read the Memo on 2017 Calhoun naming decision:    Read the letter from the Presidential Advisory Group:     Calhoun College in the evening.

"Why Electric Buses Haven't Taken Over the World—Yet. In lots of ways, the electric bus feels like a technology whose time has come. Transportation is responsible for about a quarter of global emissions, and those emissions are growing faster than in any other sector. While buses are just a small slice of the worldwide vehicle fleet, they have an outsize effect on the environment. That’s partly because they’re so dirty—one Bogotá bus fleet made up just 5 percent of the city’s total vehicles, but a quarter of its CO2, 40 percent of nitrogen oxide, and more than half of all its particulate matter vehicle emissions. And because buses operate exactly where the people are concentrated, we feel the effects that much more acutely. Enter the electric bus. Depending on the “cleanliness” of the electric grid into which they’re plugged, e-buses are much better for the environment. They’re also just straight up nicer to be around: less vibration, less noise, zero exhaust. Plus, in the long term, e-buses have lower operating costs. What with their streamlined electric engines, they’re easier to maintain (at least once maintenance folks accustomed to internal combustion learn to deal with them). “We talk to many different organizations that get so fixated on the vehicles. The actual charging stations get lost in the mix.” ",0.0
"Elizabeth Warren is auditioning for VP on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton.  Political insiders used to scoff at the idea that Hillary Clinton would choose Elizabeth Warren for her running mate.    But multiple reports have found that she’s one of the contenders on a shortlist that will soon be vetted by the Clinton team, alongside Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and potentially others. And on Monday, Clinton and Warren will campaign together at an event in Cincinnati, in what could well be an audition for veep. Many Democratic elites seem to be thrilled about the idea of a   ticket. In April, the Huffington Post’s Ryan Grim quoted a ”member of Clinton’s inner circle” saying, ”Real folks are pushing Warren. I’m into it.” Allies of Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid have been very clear to the press that he thinks Warren would be the best choice.    But does this pairing make sense  —   for Clinton, for Warren, for progressives, and for the Democratic Party as a whole?    The answer to this question is complicated by the utter strangeness of the vice presidency. The office lacks practically any formal powers, which means that a vice president’s influence depends largely on the president’s whims. Consequently, there are good arguments that Warren can be more powerful if she’s not vice president. Some recent vice presidents  —   most famously Dick Cheney, but also Joe Biden  —   have had a great deal of influence, though. Plus, there’s the small matter that a twist of fate could make whomever gets the job the most powerful person in the world. And then there’s the fact that many presidential nominees seem to ignore all this in favor of choosing a running mate solely for   electoral reasons.    So, keeping this complex set of considerations in mind, here are the best arguments Democrats have been making for and against choosing Warren as Clinton’s No. 2. The case for Vice President Warren             1) An important progressive voice would be on the ticket and in a Clinton White House: Symbolically and substantively, a Warren nomination would be a major acknowledgement of progressives’ importance in the modern Democratic Party. She’d be the most liberal vice presidential nominee in decades; her selection could help convince progressives that this Clinton administration won’t pivot to the center and leave progressives behind. (After all, Warren would be around to give them hell for it if they do.) Furthermore, Warren has already figured out how to exercise a surprising amount of influence even as a   senator  —   she’s managed to torpedo several   Obama administration appointments. The vice presidential position would give her far more prominence and an even bigger media megaphone.    And depending on what President Clinton allowed her to do, Warren could have a great deal of influence on many crucial    appointments and administrative matters like Dick Cheney once did. An unleashed Vice President Warren could champion progressive causes and combat corporate lobbyists and moneyed interests throughout the labyrinthine rulemaking process and federal government. 2) She’d unite Democrats, excite Sanders supporters, and turn out the left: With the Bernie Sanders campaign apparently winding down, the question of whether his supporters will rally around Clinton is on many Democrats’ minds. Most party elites currently assume that they will, since Sanders himself is highly likely to endorse her and since stopping Trump seems so important. But much of Sanders’s support was drawn from voters who identified as independents  —   many of them feel disenchanted by a Democratic Party they view as calcified, corporate, and corrupt. It’s possible that many of them could stay home unless the party makes a major effort to change its image  —   for instance, by choosing a populist anti —  Wall Street crusader like Warren as Clinton’s running mate. (A recent poll shows Warren is quite popular among Sanders voters who are currently saying they’ll refuse to support Clinton in the general election.) More broadly, Warren could excite the Democratic base and galvanize turnout on the left  —   which could make a crucial difference in an increasingly polarized electorate where independent voters are less important. 3) She’s an excellent attack dog who gets under Trump’s skin: A traditional role of the vice presidential pick is that of the ”attack dog”  —   someone who will aggressively go after the other party’s nominee while theoretically letting his or her own nominee remain at least somewhat above the fray.    And if Warren has proved one thing in the past few months, it’s that she’d be a fantastic attack dog against Donald Trump. On Twitter, she’s shown herself to be willing to provoke Trump with a    style. And in a speech earlier this month she tore Trump to shreds, calling him a ”  racist bully.” Furthermore, Warren really seems to get in Trump’s head, and frequently provokes    reactions from him. A vice presidential nominee who could drive Trump up the wall and force him to wound himself in response would be great for the Clinton campaign. Watch: Elizabeth Warren goes on attack against Donald Trump    4) She’d get tons of media attention: Relatedly, the Clinton campaign has reportedly been seriously concerned about whether its more traditional, reserved candidate could manage to get comparable coverage in a     media circus. But Warren is a charismatic personality who can command headlines, as we’ve recently seen  —   which could prove a potent antidote. 5) An   ticket would make history: Sure, the reaction to Clinton’s own historic nomination has been somewhat muted. But the idea of going from no women presidents or vice presidents ever to a   ticket could capture the imagination and inspire women across the country  —   and make for a particularly stark contrast with Trump’s blatant sexism. 6) Warren’s populism could have crossover appeal: Donald Trump’s general election strategy is to portray ”Crooked Hillary” as a corrupt tool of the establishment. But Warren has a sterling reputation for crusading against the influence of the wealthy and power. So her very selection as the VP nominee could seemingly debunk one of Trump’s most potentially damaging arguments against Clinton, and could help win independent voters who are disenchanted with both parties over to Clinton’s side. The case against Vice President Warren            1) Warren could be marginalized as veep: There’s one major reason that Warren and her allies might not be too thrilled about the prospect of her becoming Clinton’s running mate  —   the long, sad history of vice presidents who become completely marginalized and utterly miserable once in office.    This lore dates back to the first vice president, John Adams, who called the job ”the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived.” FDR’s first vice president, John Nance Garner, later said the job was ”the worst thing that ever happened to me.” Lyndon Johnson memorably said that ”being vice president is like being a cut dog.” There’s even an entire HBO comedy about an ignored and derided vice president. As mentioned, this is because the vice president has hardly any formal powers. The past vice presidents who have been powerful have been so because of their influence on the president, or because the president has chosen to delegate power to them. It’s noteworthy that even Johnson, who is frequently described as having   political powers, couldn’t make anything of the office. Overall, whether Warren has influence in a Clinton administration will depend almost entirely on Hillary Clinton. And in taking the job, Warren would necessarily give up her role as a top outside critic who can push the White House in a more progressive direction from the Senate. It’s a risky move, to say the least. 2) Vice President Warren could be a huge headache for President Clinton: But picking Warren could also be risky for Clinton. Any president naturally wants a vice president who is a loyal team player, rather than someone who is constantly going against the administration and causing trouble. But Warren is   and, even more importantly, has a big media following and popularity among progressives. If she disagrees with the president’s decisions or other administration activities  —   like an effort to appoint a big donor to a nuclear weapons advisory board despite his lack of any qualifications  —   she might well speak up, and could do Clinton’s presidency a great deal of damage. 3) She has little governing and foreign policy experience: Another question about Warren, of course, is whether she would in fact be ready to step in to the presidency if something should happen to Clinton.    After all, Warren has served in the Senate for less than four years and has never held any other elected office. And she seems uninterested in foreign policy, one of the most important responsibilities for a president. All this led former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, to say in June that Warren is ”not in any way, shape, or form ready to be   .” Of course, Barack Obama had no governing experience, with his main foreign policy credential being, as Clinton famously put it, ”a speech he made in 2002.” And Trump has even less, though he has run a large organization. Still, Clinton will have to decide for herself whether she thinks Warren is prepared enough for the office. 4) A ”safe” pick might be better: The conventional wisdom is that the general election is Clinton’s to lose. If that’s the case, then perhaps Clinton’s goal should be to nominate a ”safe” pick, rather than Warren, who’s a riskier,    choice. Sure, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who’s been   for months as a top Clinton VP option, might excite fewer people. But he has conventional credentials and executive experience, and he’s from a swing state. He seems unlikely to win over many voters, but he seems unlikely to alienate them either, and perhaps that’s what Clinton will want. 5) An   ticket could backfire electorally: Relatedly, a     ticket could excite voters and help Democrats. But to increase her lead on Trump, Clinton really needs to be doing a lot better with men, and Trump has been winning men by around 16 points. Could the prospect of a ticket with two women lead to a backlash, with men breaking to Trump even more strongly? Considering how deeply rooted gender stereotypes are, it sure doesn’t seem impossible  —   and Clinton, who was very cautious of the challenges facing a woman candidate in 2008, may prove to be cautious about this too.    6) Warren’s Senate seat could fall into Republican hands: The battle for control of the Senate is expected to be very closely fought this year. And should Warren resign, the Massachusetts governor who would appoint her replacement for the 160 days until a special election can be held is Charlie Baker  —   a Republican who’d likely appoint a Republican. However, apparently Harry Reid has looked into this and found out there’s a loophole that could minimize this problem, as the Boston Globe’s Matt Viser reports. Warren can announce her intent to resign months in advance, so the   clock toward the special election to replace her could start ticking while she still has the seat, meaning any   successor wouldn’t be there long, if at all. But to keep the seat, Democrats would of course still have to win that special election, which they famously failed to do in the Martha   Brown race for this very seat in 2010. 7) She’s not a unity pick: Finally, there’s the flip side of the argument that Warren’s selection could energize progressives  —   it could also drive away moderates and, perhaps more significantly, rich people and business interests. There’s an argument that Republicans’ nomination of the erratic, inflammatory Donald Trump gives Clinton an unusual opportunity to win over Republican constituencies, like wealthy donors and businesspeople, to her side, in some kind of mainstream unity coalition. (After all, the Clintons have a lot of experience raising money from rich people.) Progressives might blanch at this, but it’s also possible that the bigger Clinton’s coalition and the broader her support, the more Democrats will be elected to Congress  —   and that that bigger majority will make it easier to get more liberal laws enacted. (This is the ”campaign as a moderate, govern as a liberal” argument.)    Whether you buy this or not, it’s pretty indisputable that wealthy business elites loathe Warren  —   they see her as a     maniac. According to a recent piece by Politico’s Ben White, major Democratic donors in finance are vowing to cut off contributions to the Clinton campaign if Warren is selected. So while progressives hope that Warren’s selection could clarify the choice between Trump as the candidate of big money and unite swing voters against him, it could also drive the 1 percent straight into Trump’s arms, help the billionaire greatly improve his dismal fundraising, and make for a closer race in the end. We don’t yet know.  How Clinton’s nomination could improve politics    ",-1.0
"MLB’s latest ‘classic’ game was long, boring and unwatchable. Nationals starter Max Scherzer, who moved things along by pitching a   through four innings, called it “the craziest game I’ve ever been a part of in my career, my life. ” The Dodgers’ Adrian Gonzalez called it “one of the best games in history. ” Most baseball fans, I surmise, are left to take their words for it. Game 5 of the    NLDS  —   a     game that started at 8:08 p. m. ran 4 hours, 33 minutes, ending at 12:41 a. m. Even FOX’s Harold Reynolds must’ve run out of words. And to think that the first six innings, all scoreless,   by. It took nearly three hours to play the last three innings, 66 minutes to play the seventh, when the Nats used   pitchers among the   total of 13. (No exit velocities were posted.) The game was special, alright, like spending the night standing in line down at the DMV. Having not made it past the seventh, I don’t doubt that it was an   game, as in one not to have been missed. But if a tree falls in the woods   …     And having added an extra,    hour to the DVR, I still came up more than a   short. How special could it have been if went unseen? Can you win a beauty contest absentia? Nine innings, seven runs, 4 hours and 33 minutes? On a   night in a season in which MLB commissioner Rob Manfred again claimed to be working on speeding the pace of games? From the seventh inning through the ninth  —   three innings  —   there were 16 commercial stoppages, each lasting between 2:30 and 3 minutes, 45 minutes worth of commercials over three innings. That’s not playoff baseball, that’s a     endurance test. And that, strangely enough, brings us to the intersection of famous playwright Eugene O’Neill and Howard Johnson’s, once the largest   chain in the world and perhaps the only enterprise to benefit from an entertainment or sports event, such as Thursday’s game, lasting so long. According to historians, including Eric Burns’ book, “1920,” Mr. Johnson owned a failing restaurant in Quincy, Mass. when, in 1930, a troupe of actors arrived to perform Eugene O’Neill’s 1928   play, “Strange Interlude” in a theater across the street. The play was to have been staged in Boston, but the mayor deemed it immoral, thus it was moved to Quincy. “Strange Interlude” was a marathon, a   play  —   nine, like innings  —   during which O’Neill actually provided an intermission long enough for audiences to take a dinner break. In Quincy, the nearest place was Mr. Johnson’s joint, which served good food at low prices under an orange roof. As O’Neill’s play remained in Quincy, Johnson’s restaurant grew in popularity, finally turned a profit, and thus began 1, 000 restaurants and 500 motor lodges, all under orange roofs. Of course, “Strange Interlude” began and ended earlier than Game 5 of   and the leading men weren’t replaced eight or nine times during the final three acts. Gee, I sure wish I had seen that game. Maybe MLBN can reprise it as a     dramatic miniseries, “Strange Interlude, II. ” Just before their big mixed martial arts fight at the Hanging Garden of Nebuchadnezzar, the prohibitive underdog’s trainer, Saul of Assyria, pulled the headlines from the Old Canaan Daily Tablet, and, using Elmer’s Mortar, glued the papyrus to the front of David’s locker. “Mike The   Picks Goliath In   Slaughter. ” The   read, “Francesa of Babylon: Bet Tent On Big Favorite, Challenger Will Wind Up In Mt. Sinai. ” In late June, after Dodgers star Clayton Kershaw went on the disabled list  —   he was   with a 1. 79 ERA, at the time  —   Mike Francesa declared the Dodgers’ season over, kaput. You know the rest   …     The Dodgers,   at the time, then went   until Kershaw’s return, Sept 9. After Kershaw got the win Game 1 and save in Game 5 of the NLDS, the Dodgers now will play in the NLCS. Bill Sullivan, who by day runs a landscaping company in Alexandria, Va. by night spent his time contacting the players or families and friends of the original 1962 Mets. The result: A wonderful,     paperback, “Long Before The Miracle,” available on Amazon. A sample: Ken MacKenzie, a Yale man who went   as a ’62 Mets’ reliever, negotiated his 1963 contract with Mets’ president George Weiss with the plaint, “I’m the   member of my class at Yale. ” When sportswriter Dick Young told Casey Stengel what MacKenzie had said to Weiss about being the   man in his graduating class, Stengel said, “Yeah, and he’s got the highest earned run average, too. ” This is Sullivan’s second book. For those interested in his first, it’s titled, “Sullivan’s Practical Landscape Design. ” No fooling. Either FOX analyst Tom Verducci thinks we tuned to the playoffs to listen to him teach us baseball  —   will there be a quiz?  —   or he has the   need to let us know how much he thinks he knows. Heineken commercials, seen throughout the MLB postseason, star actor Neil Patrick Harris asking a man seen barbecuing if he had let a man “flip his meat. ” It’s just another vulgar ad that fools might confuse with clever. TV continues to credit all points scored solely to the offense  —   to establish   averages  —   and all points allowed pinned solely on the defense  —   to create   averages. They’re presented as if they’re team batting averages and ERAs. Of course, such stats totally ignore football’s connected realities, but that doesn’t matter; those stats will continue to be posted and spoken as revealing. Seems any time one tunes into the NFL Network he or she can see league promos emphasizing excessive showboating and TD dances  —   the kinds of stuff the NFL penalizes or fines. One moment discussion on how Odell Beckham Jr. needs to grow up, the next a     promo showing Beckham  . So far, so good for Islanders’ new TV    man, Brendan Burke.

"Thanks to Obama, the terrorist cancer is growing.  We still do not know who or what is responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804, but we know this much for certain: The terrorist danger is growing, and it won’t be contained to the Mediterranean. Responding to criticism of President Obama’s handling of terrorism, White House press secretary Josh Earnest boasted Thursday of all the setbacks the Islamic State has experienced in recent months, noting that in Iraq “45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. In Syria, that figure is now 20 percent. ” That’s like a patient who ignored a cancer diagnosis bragging that he finally reduced the tumor in his lung  —   glossing over the fact that he let it spread and metastasize to his other organs. If he had attacked the Islamic State cancer early, Obama could have stopped it from spreading in the first place. But instead, he dismissed the terrorist group as the “JV team” that was “engaged in various local power struggles and disputes” and did not have “the capacity and reach of a bin Laden” and did not pose “a direct threat to us. ” He did nothing, while the cancer grew in Syria and then spread in Iraq.  Now the cancer has spread and metastasized across the world.  According to a recent CNN analysis, since declaring its caliphate in 2014, the Islamic State has carried out 90 attacks in 21 countries outside of Iraq and Syria that have killed 1, 390 people and injured more than 2, 000 others. The Islamic State has a presence in more than a dozen countries and has declared “provinces” in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Post reported in 2015 that “since the withdrawal of most U. S. and international troops in December, the Islamic State has steadily made inroads in Afghanistan” where it has “poured pepper into the wounds of their enemies . . . seared their hands in vats of boiling oil . . . blindfolded, tortured and blown apart [villagers] with explosives buried underneath them. ”    On the day an EgyptAir plane carrying 66 people disappeared over the Mediterranean Sea, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that investigators will look into all ”potential factors that may have contributed to this tragedy.” (White House)   And while the Islamic State spreads and grows,   is making a comeback. Obama is touting the killing of Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour as “an important milestone,” but the truth is that the Taliban has made major military gains in Afghanistan  —   and that has opened the door to  . The Post reported in October that “American airstrikes targeted what was ‘probably the largest’   training camp found in the   Afghan war. ” Sounds good except for one small problem: There were no major   camps in Afghanistan when Obama took office. Now it is once again training terrorists in the land where it trained operatives for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.    has also regained lost ground in Yemen, the country where it trained and deployed the underwear bomber who nearly blew up a plane bound for Detroit in 2009. And as a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats Project notes, the “Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra poses one of the most significant   threats of any   group” and “is much more dangerous to the U. S. than the ISIS model in the long run. ” Overall, Gen. Jack Keane recently testified that   has “grown fourfold in the last five years. ” We’re lying to ourselves if we think that the violence we are witnessing is going to be confined to the Middle East . . . or South Asia . . . or North Africa . . . or Europe. It is only a matter of time before the Islamic State and   bring this violence here to our shores.  Indeed, in many ways we face a situation far more dangerous and complex than we did before Sept. 11, 2001. Before   we largely faced a danger from one terrorist network ( ) with safe haven in one nation (Afghanistan). Today, we face danger from multiple terrorist networks with safe havens in a dozen or more countries. Moreover, we face something we have never seen before: two terrorist networks  —   the Islamic State and    —   competing with each other for the hearts of the jihadi faithful and the backing of jihadi financiers. The way to win that competition is to be the first to carry out a catastrophic attack here in the United States.   When it came to terrorist networks, the George W. Bush administration had a mantra: We’re going to fight them over there so that we do not have to face them here at home. Obama abandoned that mantra. And now the danger is getting closer to home with each passing day.   Read more from Marc Thiessen’s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.                 ",-0.5
"Hillary’s open borders ‘dream’ is a nightmare for workers. Immigration will take center stage Wednesday night at the final Donald   Clinton debate. Clinton dreams of “open borders. ” Count on her to yank on your heartstrings. But workers who are losing their jobs to newcomers from other countries know   the danger of increasing immigration. Trump’s challenge will be to convince voters that putting American workers first is not racist or xenophobic. It’s simple economics. Hillary’s “dream” of open borders is a nightmare for wage earners. Do the math: In the last 12 months, jobs held by immigrants have increased five times as fast as those held by   workers. The American labor force is being displaced at a rapid pace. To add insult to injury, some   workers are being forced to train   replacements after they’ve been fired. Last year, Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. fired 250 tech workers and then demanded they spend their final weeks on the job teaching their replacements from India. Clinton promises to protect American jobs. Don’t count on it. Hillary’s “private position” on open borders  —   her secret dream of unlimited immigration  —   is one of the bombshell revelations in the recent WikiLeaks disclosure of her paid speeches. Now it’s clear why she refused to disclose these speeches when Bernie Sanders demanded them. Sanders smelled a rat during the primary season, when Hillary courted labor with assurances she’d preserve their jobs. He warned that her globalist views would allow wealthy corporations “to bring in all kinds of people [who] work” for low pay and “would make everybody in America poorer. ” He did the math and saw that it’s already happening. Since November 2007, jobs belonging to   workers have declined by 1. 5 million, while jobs held by immigrants (legal and illegal) have grown by 2 million. In the last year alone, employment by   American workers inched up a meager 1 percent. Immigrant employment shot up 5 percent. Some economists point to Adam Smith’s   theory that the invisible hand of the global marketplace should allow labor and raw materials to move wherever they will be used to maximum benefit. In short, open borders and free trade. That’s the theory. But in the United States, Smith’s invisible hand is smacking labor upside the head. A steady stream of newly arriving workers keeps wages down in industries like    maintenance and food preparation and serving. That benefits business owners and consumers, but the data show it depresses the standard of living of wage earners in these industries  —   the people mowing lawns, packaging frozen foods and serving burgers. As Harvard economist George Borjas shows, it also hurts immigrants already here who are struggling to make it. Hillary has declared income inequality Public Enemy No 1. She’s campaigning to raise the federal minimum wage. That’s   so long as she allows immigration to drive down wages of disadvantaged minorities, including high school dropouts and people with limited English skills.   computer workers and skilled technicians are also getting slammed by an influx of foreign workers brought here expressly to undercut their salaries. US law allows companies to evade immigration limits and bring in foreign workers under   visas to fill jobs as long as it doesn’t “adversely affect” conditions for US workers. But as one   Disney worker said, “Was I negatively affected? Yeah, I was. I lost my job. ” During the Republican primaries, Donald Trump attacked these special visas and pledged, “If I am president, I will not issue any   visas. ” Trump’s not entirely innocent  —   he used similar immigration loopholes to staff his resorts. But he says what he did as a businessman and what he’ll do as president are different. Meanwhile, tech firms like Facebook and Apple are pushing for more  —   not fewer  —     visas and looser immigration laws. Tech moguls are shoveling millions into Clinton’s campaign. And remember: Money talks, especially with the Clintons.  ",1.0
"Mount St. Helens Has Nothing on Its Little-Known Neighbors. Most people, when asked what area in the Cascade Range has spit the most lava and ash out over the past 5,000 years, would answer Mount St. Helens. It is the Cascade volcano that has had the most well-known eruption in US history (its 1980 blast) and is the only volcano in the entire range to have erupted in the past 100 years. So, as this leading question might imply, you'd likely be surprised to find out that Mount St. Helens isn't the leader in volcanic eruptions. In fact, neither is Rainier or Lassen or Hood. In fact, the leader in total volume over the past five millennia doesn't even really have a name—but has dumped 15 cubic kilometers (that's over 3.5 cubic miles) of lava onto the surface of the Earth.

"There are 2 steps Matt Harvey must take or this ‘ends badly’. There must be a sincere apology from Matt Harvey to his teammates on Tuesday. But those are just words. The Mets want much more from Harvey. They have reached the point of no return. The Mets and Terry Collins want Harvey to earn back their lost trust. He must earn back respect. And that can only happen one way. Not just show up to work, which Harvey failed to do Saturday, but succeed at his job. Pitch well come Friday in Milwaukee, stop with all the excuses, and battle for the team, not for the Matt Harvey brand. “He has to make some changes or this could end badly,” one Mets official told The Post on Monday night at Citi Field before the Mets played the Giants. Harvey has gone from Dark Knight to good night, as in the Mets front office and players are so tired of the drama and are ready to move on with or without him. Tired as in, “Whatever, dude, we are trying to survive here, we could use you. ” Harvey was the one reportedly with the killer migraine Saturday, but the Mets are the ones having to deal with that headache as Harvey’s     suspension comes to an end Tuesday with a possible grievance down the road. There are two things Harvey must do starting Tuesday: Let his teammates know the job comes first and that he will be a better teammate. Do the little things like be on the bench to cheer for your teammates, one of Collins’ strict rule for his pitchers. The Mets have become a reality show  —   sex toy included, along with Noah Syndergaard’s MRI fiasco  —   but enough with the diva act from the mound. “It’s hard enough to try to win games, we don’t need the extra stuff,” one Met said of the general feeling in the clubhouse in regards to Harvey. When asked what Harvey has to do moving forward, Collins’ answer was telling. “Because this guy was such a dominant power pitcher, can he get back there, that’s all everybody wanted to see was the velocity,” Collins said. “But I want to see him pitch, because I have seen this guy pitch at 94 with command. What I’m seeing is a guy who pitched part of last season without any feelings in his fingers, and he is starting to get it back, this guy hit 97 the other night, that put smiles on some guys’ faces. I want to see him keep pitching because I think it’s going to come. “OK, he made a mistake the other day. I think we’ll get by it,” Collins said. “He’s a big figure in New York. I think with the help of his teammates and his coaching staff, we’ll move on and hopefully in two months we are back to where we were with him pitching well. “I know he’s a tough guy, but he has had two tough years in a row. We’ve got to build him up, we’ve got to keep that confidence growing. We’re trying to keep him positive. ” Yes, those close to Harvey say his confidence is down right now, but to make all this happen you have to show up to work and not be as   as Harvey has been. Get to the ballpark and get to work. It’s that simple. None other than Doc Gooden, a pitcher who had all the talent in the world and also had all the trouble in the world was at Citi Field on Monday night. “I want to talk to Matt,” Gooden said. “I still believe in him. ” In the end, too much drama off the field is never good for a team. It wears everyone out. Harvey, 28, is   lifetime with Tommy John and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome surgeries on his pitching chart. This season he is   with a 5. 14 ERA. He has allowed 46 base runners over 35 innings. That is much too much drama for those numbers. Show up to work, Matt, be a good teammate and try to mix in a win.",1.0

"Let's All Just Chill About Processed Foods. You are you and I am me because of processed foods, because our ancestors learned how to cook meat and make bread and, perhaps more importantly, beer. Accordingly, our brains grew and our guts transformed. But those two words smashed together, processed foods, take on new terror in this era of organic, locally sourced, artisanal, cage-free, free-range, I-want-to-know-the-given-name-of-the-chicken-I’m-eating food. Into this zeitgeist of culinary purity waltzes the plant-based meat movement, providing beef alternatives that are about as processed as processed can be. The Impossible Burger, for instance, is engineered taste by taste, smell by smell, texture by texture, to replicate ground beef—the stuff even bleeds like the real thing. KFC is testing plant-based chicken nuggets and wings. But some chains like Chipotle are crying foul, saying the stuff is too processed for their delicate tastes. (This is Chipotle, after all: that bastion of healthiness where a typical meal packs more than 1,000 calories, along with a massive amount of sodium and saturated fat.) But it’s time to get real about processed foods. For one, processed doesn’t have to mean unhealthy, and indeed it’s only because of certain processed foods that people around the world get the nutrition they need. Two, processed foods keep better, cutting down on food waste. And three, if we expect to feed a growing population on a planet with finite arable land, we have to engineer new sources of food, protein in particular. The core of the confusion around processed foods is definitional. According to the Institute of Food Technologists, processing is—and get ready for this—“one or more of a range of operations, including washing, grinding, mixing, cooling, storing, heating, freezing, filtering, fermenting, extracting, extruding, centrifuging, frying, drying, concentrating, pressurizing, irradiating, microwaving, and packaging.” So … virtually everything you put in your mouth is processed. “Highly refined foods like yogurt, olive oil, and bread have many, many processing steps, and they don't look anything like the original product they started with,” says Connie Weaver, a nutrition scientist at Purdue University. Processed foods can be essential for human health. Iodized salt, for instance, has helped people the world over get the iodine their bodies need to function. “There's this really confusing nomenclature going around right now, with this idea that we can classify food as being good or bad based on its degree of processing,” says Ruth MacDonald, a nutrition scientist and registered dietician at Iowa State University. “And it makes no sense from a nutritional perspective, and it really makes no sense from a food science perspective either.” What people likely mean when they invoke processing has more to do with ingredients. Any bread will involve grinding, mixing, fermenting, and heating. But white bread goes through an extra step to bleach the flour, which removes some natural nutrients, which are later added back in to make it fortified. And something like a Twinkie takes processing to a whole new level, with added corn syrup and, for good measure, high fructose corn syrup thrown in as well. It’s the added ingredients that have given processed foods a bad name, because while not all processed foods are junk foods, all junk foods are processed. Supercharging taste with saturated fat, sugar, or salt can be easy, but they're unhealthy hacks when taken too far. What this means is that, as consumers, we should be asking questions not about the processing so much as the ingredients. The Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, from Beyond Meat, aren’t what you’d call health foods. For every 4 ounces, you get 14 grams of fat from Impossible and 18 grams from Beyond, compared to 23 grams from 80 percent lean ground beef. Looking at the calories, it’s 240 for Impossible, 250 for Beyond, and 288 for beef. But sodium is where the plant-based alternatives go wild: 370 mg for Impossible and 390 mg for Beyond, compared to just 75 mg for the real thing. In fairness, being plant-based, Impossible and Beyond incorporate fiber, which is nil in real beef, and are fortified with vitamins and minerals. But it’s with one particular ingredient that the Impossible Burger has run into controversy: soy leghemoglobin, the vegetarian version of heme, which gives blood its color and metallic taste. You’d normally find soy leghemoglobin in the roots of soy plants, but in the interest of efficiency Impossible Foods has genetically engineered yeast to churn out the stuff. They combine soy leghemoglobin with more soy and potato and other plant ingredients to build a convincing duplicate of ground beef. Soy leghemoglobin is a novel ingredient in the food supply—it occurs naturally only in the roots of soy plants, which no one eats. So in 2014 the company filed a “generally recognized as safe” review with the FDA. A year later, the agency responded with questions about the safety of soy leghemoglobin. Impossible Foods then resubmitted, and the FDA came back with no further questions in 2018, meaning the agency deems the ingredient “generally recognized as safe.” The key bit here is the FDA didn’t give a hoot about how the ingredient was made—by genetically engineering yeast, in this case—but about how the ingredient might affect human health. That is, a processed food isn’t necessarily unsafe because it’s a processed food. A processed food might be unsafe because it’s got a bad ingredient in it. “Are these products processed?” asks MacDonald. “Yeah, they're highly processed—the Impossible Burger has a ton of things in it that are all processed. Not that that's a bad thing necessarily, but it is way more processed than ground beef is.” What you really should be thinking about when considering ordering that Impossible or Beyond burger is whether its ingredients fit your diet. Certainly don’t eat the Impossible Burger if you have a soy allergy, and take note of that sodium tally if your doctor told you to cut back on salt. The thinking behind the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger isn’t to give vegans a way to eat “meat” guilt-free, but to wean meat-eaters off the real thing. And sure, these alternatives are far more processed compared to a burger made of lentils and mushrooms mashed together. “That's wonderful, that's delicious, and probably quite nutritious, but it's probably not going to replicate meat, and it's not going to allow meat-eaters to stop eating meat,” says Sue Klapholz, VP of nutrition and health at Impossible Foods. That’s important, because this new era of food science could help dig us out of growing problems facing the world’s food supply. It’s abundantly clear that our food production is busted and almost uniformly terrible for this planet—we waste a quarter of the food we produce, while the global food system accounts for perhaps 37 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Cows burp up methane, and a single bovine consumes up to 11,000 gallons of water a year. The promise of plant-based meat, as well as meat grown from cow cells in the lab, is that technology can create more sustainable alternatives to beef and chicken and pork. That’s the promise, anyway—we need much more data on the energy footprint of these technologies. The solution, as has been the solution for humanity from the moment we learned to dehydrate meat for long journeys, is to process our food to be more nutritious, longer-lasting, and sustainable.

"Trump’s inaugural cake was commissioned to look exactly like Obama’s, baker says.      Amid the glitz of President Trump’s inaugural festivities, one item stood out in particular late Friday night: a spectacular   cake that the new president and Vice President Pence cut into with a sword. To pastry chef Duff Goldman, the cake seemed a little too familiar  —   because it looked almost exactly like one he had made years earlier for Barack Obama’s second inauguration as president. Just after midnight, the Food Network personality posted a    comparison of two cakes on his Twitter account. On the left, Goldman wrote in the caption, was the cake he had created for the “  ” inaugural ball in 2013. The one on the right was the cake that had just appeared at Trump’s “Salute to Our Armed Services” ball. It appeared nearly identical to Goldman’s cake from four years ago, right down to the colors, the patriotic bunting, and the placement of several small silver stars and seals. “I didn’t make it,” Goldman wrote about Trump’s cake, adding a suspicious   emoji at the end.   The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama’s inauguration 4 years ago. The one on the right is Trumps. I didn’t make it. 🤔 pic. twitter.   —   Duff Goldman (@Duff_Goldman) January 21, 2017   Neither Goldman nor representatives from Trump’s transition and inauguration teams responded to requests for comment Saturday morning, but Tiffany MacIsaac, owner of Washington’s Buttercream Bakeshop, stepped forward to say she had been the one to create the    cake.   [The Maggie Austin LaBaugh cakes that look like another baker’s? ‘An homage. ’]   She said that the order came in while she was out of town, and that the client had brought in a photo of the cake from Obama’s inauguration asking her to   it. “They came to us a couple of weeks ago, which is pretty last minute, and said ‘We have a photo that we would like to replicate,’ ” MacIsaac told The Washington Post by phone. Her bakery tried to encourage the client to use the photo as “inspiration,” as they do with many others, she said. “They said, ‘Nope, they want this exact cake. It’s perfect.’ And we said, great,” MacIsaac said. Neither she nor her spokeswoman revealed who placed the order. The “Salute to Our Troops” ball was one of three official presidential inaugural balls held Friday and open by invitation only to members of the military, veterans, first responders and their families.      Excited to share the cake we got to make for one of last night’s inaugural balls. While we most love creating original designs, when we are asked to replicate someone else’s work we are thrilled when it is a masterpiece like this one. @duff_goldman originally created this for Obama’s inauguration 4 years ago and this years committee commissioned us to   it. Best part is all the profits are being donated to @humanrightscampaign, one of our favorite charities who we have loved working with over the years. Because basic human rights are something every man, woman and child~ straight, gay or the rainbow in between~ deserve! A photo posted by Buttercream Bakeshop (@bttrcrmbakeshop) on Jan 21, 2017 at 7:35am PST    MacIsaac did not want to state her political affiliation, but said her bakery began planning how it would donate its proceeds from the Trump inaugural cake to charity. The baker and her staff chose the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal treatment of the LGBT community  —   and that has declared Trump “unfit for the presidency. ” “I’m a   owner and one of the things I’m very, very proud about is that I don’t discriminate,” MacIsaac said. “I would never turn someone away based on their age, their sex, their sexual orientation, their political views. It’s just not the way we operate. ” MacIsaac said the attention caught her by surprise partly because, per the order, the Trump cake was intended to be more of a prop: All but a   slice at the bottom was inedible. “It’s just a Stryofoam cake. It’s not for eating,” she said. “I wasn’t expecting it to be seen on TV. ” As is customary with many of her creations, MacIsaac posted a photo of the   cake on Instagram the day after the event. By then, Goldman’s tweet  —   and controversy over the cake  —   had found its way to her. “Obviously, my intention was definitely not to upset him in any way,” MacIsaac said of Goldman, whom she does not know personally. “I just wish that it had not been presented the way that it was. ” Goldman, who founded Charm City Cakes in Baltimore and Los Angeles, is known for his showstopping cake creations. From 2006 to 2011, the Food Network reality show “Ace of Cakes” followed Goldman as he ran his bakery and pulled out all the stops to construct elaborate cakes. These days, the celebrity pastry chef is better known to   bakers as “Chef Duff” as one of the judges on the network’s “Kids Baking Championship. ” Later Saturday, Goldman posted to Twitter again, with an apparent change of heart. “Remembering a fantastic cake I made is awesome and the chef that   it for @POTUS Trump did a fantastic job,” he tweeted. “Group hug, y’all. ”   Remembering a fantastic cake I made is awesome and the chef that   it for @POTUS Trump did a fantastic job. Group hug, y’all. 🇺🇸  —   Duff Goldman (@Duff_Goldman) January 21, 2017   In 2013, Goldman told The Post’s Tim Carman he wanted Obama’s inaugural cake to be perfect. “When you’re doing a cake like this, you know that everybody is going to be looking at it,” Goldman said. “It’s a lot of pressure. The more recognition you get for something that you do, the greater the pressure becomes, because more people are looking for a mistake. So you really gotta make sure your work is  . ” Goldman described his cake for Obama to The Post in great detail then: The      cake was meant to pay special homage to the nation’s armed forces, with seals of the five branches military. The different tiers would each be of different flavors, from red velvet to   chip. Though he expressed some anxiety about pulling off the cake in 2013, Goldman ultimately delivered on his vision. “It was our honor to create this cake for last night’s    Ball  —   an experience we will never forget,” the Charm City Cakes Facebook page noted with a picture of the cake the day after Obama’s 2013 inauguration. (For the record, Obama has said he is more of a pie person.)   [This Trump victory cake will haunt your dreams]   Allegations of plagiarism are not new in Trump’s nascent administration. During his transition, Trump aide Monica Crowley said she would not take a national security communications post after charges she had plagiarized several passages in her 2012 book. And the president’s spouse, Melania Trump, was accused of lifting a portion of her speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention from one Michelle Obama gave at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. And shortly after Donald Trump gave his inaugural address on Friday, some thought that a small part of his speech sounded quite similar to words uttered by the Batman villain Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises. ” It was not even the first time a celebratory cake for Trump had made headlines. On Election Day, a large bust of his head  —   in cake form  —   was carted into Trump Tower for his victory party. The jarring image set Twitter afire.      The Republican candidate’s head and shoulders in cake form was wheeled into Trump Tower for his victory party.

"This is Obama’s plan to line the country’s roads with electric vehicle chargers.      The White House on Thursday announced an array of new initiatives aimed at clinching one key goal in a transition away from burning fossil fuels  —   switching the nation’s millions of drivers from gas guzzlers to electric vehicles. The key to this transition? Installing a widespread national network of electric vehicle charging stations that will allow potential drivers to get around a key psychological problem: “range anxiety. ” At present, many people are justifiably afraid that they’ll run out of charge on their EV far from a station where they can repower its battery. We know it’s easy in most places to find a gas station, but we don’t know as much about charging stations. And without that assurance, EV sales will continue to be held back. To change this, the White House announced a new designation of up to $4. 5 billion in Energy Department loan guarantees to support new types of EV charging infrastructure, plans to designate and develop key electric vehicle “charging corridors” across the country, plans for the government itself to procure large numbers of electric vehicles and research initiatives at the Department of Energy and its laboratories to improve EV charging technologies. The array of initiatives “serves the goal of providing consumers with more comfort that they will be able to move across regions and across the country in their electric vehicles,” said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to President Obama, on a call with reporters. At the same time, the White House announced that some of the country’s largest power companies and automakers  —   ranging from Duke Energy to the Southern Company, and from Ford to Tesla  —   had signed on to a joint statement pledging to “drive the market transformation to electric vehicles by making it easy for consumers to charge their vehicles. ” The partnership signals that even as Tesla and other automakers build more electric cars, companies like Duke, the country’s largest electric utility, are taking steps to create more facilities to accommodate them. Duke recently announced a plan to offer cities in North Carolina $1 million to develop charging facilities, even though there are only about 4, 700 EVs in the state right now, the company’s Randy Wheeless said in a recent interview with The Washington Post. “To really get people realizing that the infrastructure is there in place, you just have to continue to grow it,” Wheeless said. Duke expects charging infrastructure to grow by 30 percent in North Carolina because of the program. Deese said that since Obama’s first year in office, the number of electric vehicle charging stations in the U. S. has grown from 500 to 16, 000. “That’s a 40 fold increase over the last eight years,” he said. Lynn Orr, undersecretary for science and energy at the Department of Energy, added that there are now close to 500, 000   electric vehicles on the road in the country (the largest number are in California). “The transportation sector is a quarter of our nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, so there’s a very important opportunity here,” Orr said, if these numbers can grow further. Indeed, as the U. S. swings precipitously away from burning coal as its source of electricity, our automobile habits are fast becoming our biggest remaining climate change problem. In one of the new initiatives, Orr said the Energy Department would apply its research abilities to try to find out how to build charging technologies that can power up an EV with a   range in the space of 10 minutes  —   far faster than what’s currently available. “That’s enough for you to plug it in, run in and get your cup of coffee, and sip on that for a minute or two until you’re ready to go,” Orr said.",-0.5
"This is what makes Republicans and Democrats so different.  MSNBC asked Benjy Sarlin, its reporter on the Republican race, and Alex   its reporter on the Democratic race, to flip jobs for a week and write up what they learned. Their conversation is worth reading in full, but something Sarlin wrote caught my eye:     I was caught off guard by how specific and personal Democratic voters’ issues tended to be. One woman told me she had lost a job because she had to take care of a sick relative and wanted paid family leave. Another woman told me her insurance stopped covering a certain medication that had grown too expensive and she liked how Clinton and Sanders talked about lowering drug prices. One man told me his wages were stagnant at his hotel job and he was looking for policies to increase them. ”We’re talking about    issues,” Phyllis Thede, an Iowa state representative backing Clinton, told me when I asked about her constituents’ top concerns. By contrast, Republican voters tend to be excited by more abstract issues: One of the most common answers I get from Cruz voters when I ask about their leading concern is ”the Constitution.” There are fewer ”I have a specific problem in my own life, and I’d like the government to do x about it” responses.  Sarlin’s observations mirror interesting research from Matthew Grossmann and David Hopkins about how Republicans and Democrats differ. Their main finding is that Democrats are motivated by specific policy deliverables while Republicans are motivated by broader philosophical principles. But behind this finding is some interesting evidence. Democrats like compromise; Republicans don’t Democrats prefer politicians who compromise, and Republicans prefer politicians who stick to their principles. This is true even when a Republican holds the presidency:               ”Though they voiced strong disapproval of Bush, Democrats still expressed a preference for compromise in government  —   a tendency that has carried over to the Obama era,” write Grossmann and Hopkins. ”Republicans have been consistent in their elevation of principle over moderation, regardless of which party is in power.”    Democrats rely on more interest groups than Republicans The ecosystem of interest groups making endorsements on the Democratic side is both larger and more interconnected than on the Republican side  —   which means there are more organized groups asking Democrats for policy than asking Republicans for policy. You can see that in this graphic, which connects interest groups that endorsed more than one of the same candidate or bill in the  ’02 Congress and the 2002 midterm election. So if the   and the Sierra Club both endorsed Sen. Pat Leahy for reelection and also both endorsed No Child Left Behind, they get a line. The more shared endorsements between two groups, the thicker the line connecting them; the more total connections any individual group has to other groups, the larger the circle they get.               But Democratic interest groups aren’t just more numerous; they’re also more persistent. ”The Democratic Party contains strong links between its electoral and legislative coalitions. . .. The diverse groups that come together to support the same candidates also ally when it comes to passing bills in Congress,” write Grossmann and Hopkins. ”The Republican Party lacks similar ties between its electoral and legislative coalitions, mostly because few of its groups regularly join coalitions to support or oppose legislation.” Policymaking has a liberal bias  —   even when Republicans do it Democratic presidents talk more about policy, propose more specific policy ideas, and pass more significant pieces of legislation. The numbers are stark. Since 1945, Democratic presidents have put forward 39 percent more policy proposals than Republican presidents, and 62 percent more domestic policy proposals. ”There is a good reason for this asymmetry,” write Grossmann and Hopkins. ”Democrats and liberals are more likely to focus on policymaking because any change that occurs is much more likely to be liberal than conservative. New policies usually expand the scope of government responsibility, funding, or regulation. There are occasional conservative policy successes as well, but they are less frequent and are usually accompanied by expansion of government responsibility in other areas.”    VIDEO: Lawmaking has a liberal bias    Why there’s no Democratic tea party I’ve often heard liberals wonder why there’s no Democratic version of the Tea Party. I’ve often heard conservatives complain that their party doesn’t spend enough time coming up with serious policy solutions for issues like health care. And, to be sure, there are some liberals trying to popularize Tea Party —  like tactics and some conservatives trying to come up with sweeping new health reforms. But it’s hard for these initiatives to succeed. There’s a tendency to imagine the parties as mirror images of each other, and thus to believe they can easily follow the other’s strategies. But they can’t. The parties are good at different things because they really are different. That difference, however, can lead to deep misunderstandings. Democrats tend to project their preference for policymaking onto the Republican Party  —   and then respond with anger and confusion when Republicans don’t seem interested in making a deal. Republicans tend to assume the Democratic Party is more ideological than it is, and so see various policy initiatives as part of an ideological effort to remake America along more socialistic lines.

"NYC families are bringing the suburbs to the city. Stroll the 11 blocks of Manhattan’s riverfront East End Avenue, and you’ll notice a remarkable absence of city noise.  “You can open your window on Saturday morning and not hear the hum of traffic,” says   sales director Nicole   who lived there for six years. “You literally hear birds. ” The tony neighborhood also offers the tranquil     sports facilities at   and   schools like   and  . Not to mention a new crop of growing families who’ve decided they want all the amenities of a leafy suburb without the hassle of a commute.

So last fall, the family (including newborn twins) moved into a tranquil   duplex at the Toll Brothers’ Pierhouse  —   set along the   Brooklyn Bridge Park, which wraps around the western edge of the borough. The 106   residences hover around $2, 146 per square foot and offer private rooftops, landscaped terraces, bike storage and views of Manhattan. “It’s peaceful, which is what I guess people look for in the suburbs, but you’re in Manhattan in a few minutes,” Emanuel notes. Suburban perks also abound: soccer fields, beach volleyball courts and sailing lessons from      (where even a West Elm is on its way). For those tempted, other new options in the ’hood include 51 Jay Street, a former factory that offers rare   lofts, and One Brooklyn Bridge Park, where Sotheby’s International Realty’s top broker Karen Heyman is selling an    unit for $23 million.

"Giants get injury clarity, but not all the help they wanted. The Giants will be getting some help for their sagging offense, but not quite all the reinforcements they were hoping to gain for their showdown with the Cowboys. Running back Shane Vereen was activated off injured reserve Saturday and will make his return Sunday night against the Cowboys. Vereen has missed the last nine games with a torn triceps. There will not be help arriving for the offensive line, as left guard Justin Pugh is expected to miss his fifth consecutive game because his knee injury is not fully healed. To make room on the roster for Vereen, the contract of offensive lineman Adam Gettis was terminated. Vereen was hurt in the Sept. 25 loss to the Redskins and the thought at the time was he would be finished for the season. The Giants put him on   injured reserve and he was able to resume practicing two weeks ago. His addition gives the Giants their best   running back coming out of the backfield, which could help   the passing and running attack, as many of the short throws to Vereen are similar to running plays. Pugh was hoping and expecting to shed his knee injury concerns and make it back to take his starting spot at left guard to face the Cowboys, but that is not going to happen. Marshall Newhouse is expected to start in place of Pugh, as he did last week in Pittsburgh. Pugh was listed as a limited participant in practice every day this week and there was concern if he came back for this game he risked further injury that could possibly keep him out the remainder of the season. Cowboys rookie RB Ezekiel Elliott gets to run behind the NFL’s best offensive line. Still, he averages 107 rushing yards per game and is on pace for 1, 713 yards for the season. “He is running all over everybody,’’ said DT Damon Harrison, one of the premier   in the league. “From the very first time we played against him, we all said that that guy is going to be a player in this league and that seems to be true up until this point. ’’ The Giants limited Elliott to 51 yards on 20 rushing attempts in the opener, Elliott’s NFL debut. Ben McAdoo on whether there are statement games in a season: “Yes, there’s one every February. ’’   …     This will be the seventh time in Giants history they have played a   game against a team that has won at least 11 consecutive games  —   the Giants have been the home team in every game. They are   in those games  —   the lone win was a victory over the   Broncos in 1998. Most recently, they lost to the   Panthers   on Dec. 20, 2015. The Cowboys will be without at least two starting defensive backs, CB Morris Claiborne (groin) and S J. J. Wilcox (thigh) and kick returner Lucky Whitehead did not make the trip because of a violation of team rules. Two other starters in the secondary are listed as questionable: CB Orlando Scandrick (foot) and S Barry Church (forearm).

"Trump chides Democrats for blocking his policies. President Trump accused the Democrats of selfishly standing in the way of America’s best interests in a new tweet  —   the morning after passing his   milestone in office. “The Democrats, without a leader, have become the party of obstruction. They are only interested in themselves and not in what’s best for U. S.,”  The Trump administration has repeatedly blamed Democrats for standing in the way of his nominees, amidst criticism that it is lagging behind in the first stretch. “We’re behind, but because of historical unbelievable obstruction from U.

"Disney finally putting up fence around gator-infested lagoon. Disney World officials on Friday finally put up a fence along a lagoon they have long known was infested with alligators, but only after one of the beasts killed a    boy as he played in the water. A temporary barrier of wooden posts connected by heavy rope was installed along the Seven Seas Lagoon shoreline where a gator snatched away little Lane Graves on Tuesday evening. Workers also put up signs that read: “Danger. Alligators and snakes in area. Stay away from the water. Do not feed the wildlife. ” The   resort had known for decades about the alligator issue  —   and was even sued in the 1980s about the lack of warnings after another child was attacked  —   yet there were only “no swimming” signs in place at the lagoon. A crew of more than a dozen workers from a Disney contractor, Buena Vista Construction Co. fanned out on the beach to dig holes and put up the fence and new signs along the     lake. A Disney employee told The Post that an alligator attack “could happen anytime. ” Jacquee Wahler, vice president of Walt Disney World Resort, vowed to take further precautions to prevent such an attack. “We are installing signage and temporary barriers at our resort beach locations and are working on permanent,   solutions at our beaches,” she said in a statement. “We continue to evaluate processes and procedures for our entire property, and, as part of this, we are reinforcing training with our [staff] for reporting sightings and interactions with wildlife and are expanding our communication to guests on this topic. ” Lane and his family, including his    sister, were playing on the shore outside the luxe Grand Floridian Resort & Spa when the alligator got its jaws around the boy in shallow water and dragged him under.   on Wednesday.

"To build a better city, take a hint from this pile of slime mold. Were you stuck in a jam on the way to work this morning? Is your train always full? If so, you may want to ponder this. Could you have got to work quicker if the road or railway had been designed not by a human, at vast expense, but by an ant or even a   sticky blob of slime? It sounds ridiculous but researchers are looking at how ants, bees and even slime mold build their own transport networks to see if they could do a better job than we do. In some cases, slime mold has already redesigned human transport systems into more efficient networks that are quicker to get around. With Australia undergoing an infrastructure boom  —   Sydney and Melbourne alone are spending more than $50 billion on new motorways and rail links  —   should we be seeking inspiration from amoebas? Slime mold, an organism which can usually be found slithering along forest floors putrefying mushrooms, doesn’t have many friends in this world but one of them is Professor Tanya Latty from Sydney University. Last week, the entomologist gave a talk at the university’s Sydney Science Forum about slime mold’s role as one of nature’s best engineers. But even she acknowledges slime mold’s downsides. “It’s fundamentally weird and alien,” she tells news. com. au. “If you’ve seen the movie The Blob, it’s pretty much what slime mold is. “It’s a big yellow mucusy thing which I like to think of as   snot. ” But the   beast, this particular variety of which is known as physarum polycephalum (literally the “many headed slime”) has some redeeming features. Like many of us, it likes nothing more than to eat oats in the morning and, as Latty says, “slime mold is the poster child of resilience. Nothing can stop it. ” What wasn’t resilient was the Italian power network in the winter of 2003. A tree fell on a single power line in the Alps and caused nationwide chaos. The power that should have gone through the felled power line instead went to other lines, overloading them in the process and plunging 56 million people into darkness for 24 hours. If ants or slime had plotted where the power lines should be built, the blackout may never have happened. “People who live in cities are extremely dependent on a whole network of critical infrastructure systems for everything we do. But when they go wrong, it’s a really big problem,” Latty said. Not so for the Argentine ant. This little critter lives in multiple nests and between them builds invisible insect roads created by dabbing the route with pheromones. What’s more, ants can often work out the mathematically shortest route between various points, something humans can struggle with. “Why would an ant need an efficient transport system?” says Latty. “Because when it’s above ground things can eat it or it can dry out in the sun, so if you have ridiculously long meandering trails that ant is increasing the probability it will get killed. ” But while the routes are short they are also not very permanent. If something blocks their path, the Argentine ants have to find a new way to connect their nests. The Australian meat ant has another solution. These ferocious insects build ant motorways so large you can see them on Google Maps. The industrious ants cut down grass and clear paths so they can access food quicker without having to clamber through undergrowth. But unlike their Argentinian cousins, the meat ant has another trick up its sleeve. It builds multiple routes between its nest and food sources so if one is blocked, say by a falling tree, the ants can follow another. Already, the meat ant is more resilient than the Italian power network. “The problem of connecting up lots of points is what human engineers have to do the whole time, so with the Sydney rail network you need to connect up all the stations in a way that makes some kind of sense,” says Latty. But it’s the sticky slime mound which is the most ingenious when it comes to building transport systems. In 2010, Japanese researcher Toshioyuki Nakagaki, of Hokkaido University set a blob of this brainless slime a challenge. He wanted to see if it could find its way through a small maze. At both ends he put a pile of oats and then waited to see where its sticky veiny tentacles took it. “First slime mold does what you expect a blob to do,” says Latty. “It sloshes around but over time some parts of the mold get these much thicker tubes but it’s also getting rid of tubes in redundant parts of the maze. “If you give the slime mold 24 hours by and large it will have found the shortest path. ” It proved, Nakagaki told the UK’s   that humans were not the only beings with the ability to process complex information. The slime was then let loose on a map of Tokyo with a big pile of oats for the CBD and smaller piles for suburbs and railway stations. The mold fanned out with its creeping yellow tubes visibly connecting the oat piles. The pattern it created amazed the academics. “What it ended up with was almost identical to the map of the actual Tokyo metro system so it seems whatever the slime mold is doing is what human engineers are trying to do. “The difference is humans have massive brains, access to computers and hundreds of years of history designing networks and the slime mold is basically just moving mucus,” she says. The slime has been sent on other trips. On a map of Canada, it faithfully recreated the country’s motorway network. But on a map of the US, the slime created several different path ways between the major American cities suggesting the freeway network could be far more efficient. Latty says it been on her “  list” to set the slime free on a map of Sydney or Melbourne to see if the train network is really the most efficient and find out where new lines should go. “We wouldn’t normally think of slime mold as being able to help us build better transport systems yet there are scientists working on this right now. ” Equally, we could learn a lot from the robustness of the meat ants interlinked highways on the forest floor. But she cautions against leaving all our major infrastructure decisions up to ants and neon yellow snot. “You wouldn’t literally put slime mold on a map and invest money there because there are all sorts of other things humans need to take into account such as closeness of schools and hospitals,” Latty said. “We should look at what ants and slime mold are doing and draw inspiration from that and use our big brains to tweak those solutions into something more workable. ” Nevertheless, if your trip to work was a breeze today maybe it’s because the route you took would have been the same one a blob of slime would have chosen if it was in charge.",1.0

"WhatsApp Cofounder Brian Acton on Why Privacy Matters. The cofounder of WhatsApp and the Signal Foundation thinks the use of encrypted communications tools will only increase in the future. “There’s a global education that’s happening,” says Brian Acton, who left WhatsApp in 2018 and now chairs the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which promotes open source, end-to-end encryption in messaging. “Back in the ‘90s, we all got the same hoax emails, and we all learned to ignore them. Today privacy is becoming a much more mainstream discussion. People are asking questions about privacy, and they want security and privacy built into the terms of service.” Acton spoke onstage with WIRED writer Steven Levy on Friday at the WIRED25 conference in San Francisco. ""We want to be in the business of not knowing the people who are using the product."" Brian Acton, the Signal Foundation Acton cofounded WhatsApp in 2009, and he began working with Signal cofounder Moxie Marlinspike in 2013 when they began the process of incorporating end-to-end encryption into WhatsApp. The time was right to do so, says Acton. WhatsApp had 400 million users. As more and more people began using the service, WhatsApp drew the attention of law enforcement officials. Subpoenas for user information were rolling in. Acton grew afraid that WhatsApp would turn into a mass surveillance dragnet. Acton and his cofounder sold the messaging service to Facebook in 2014. After an acrimonious split with the social media giant in 2018, Acton left Facebook to cocreate the Signal Technology Foundation with Marlinspike. By promoting privacy and anonymity in communications, Acton has faced criticism for affording the same services to not only the white hats but the black hats too—criminals and other bad actors. Acton has remained agnostic, preferring to make the service available without policing who can use it. “In general we want to be in the business of not knowing the people who are using the product,” Acton says. “The bad guys are always going to be bad guys. But the good guys—lawyers, the press—they need the technology, and they need the education.”",0.0
"Into the Inferno Trailer: Volcanoes Are So Hot Right Now. When Werner Herzog latches onto a topic, he doesn’t just create one movie and then move on to the next object of fascination. He goes in-depth, sometimes even returning to something he’s worked on before. Right now, it appears that thing is volcanoes—and he’s going full-force into investigating humanity's fascination with the unpredictable agents of chaos. Back in 1977, Herzog made La Soufriere: Waiting for an Inevitable Disaster, a documentary about a volcano on the island of Guadeloupe, which had been evacuated due to an impending eruption. Now, in 2016, the director has two volcano-themed films on the docket: Salt and Fire, a narrative feature that screened at the Toronto International Film Festival about ecologists in Bolivia dealing with a potential supervolcano disaster, and Into the Inferno, a documentary about volcanoes in Iceland, Indonesia, and Ethiopia that will hit Netflix on Oct. 28. The first trailer for the latter movie debuted today, and it is—as one might expect—a beguiling mix of the director's signature voiceover work and beautiful/frightening footage of bubbling red-hot magma. Planet Earth II doesn’t have a release date yet, so this looks like your best bet for a hypnotizing nature documentary for the rest of 2016. ",0.0
"A tarnished Robert Griffin III joins the woebegone Browns. What could go wrong?.      So one of the most polarizing players in professional sports has signed up with one of the most chaotic franchises in the NFL to play one of the most unstable positions, on any team, in any league. Godspeed, RGIII. Might want to rent, not buy. Thursday’s news that Robert Griffin III was headed to Cleveland felt both agonizing and inevitable to many who watched his pro career ascend, and then crash, and then implode, and then attract rabid muskrats with radioactive teeth. Griffin just finished up four of the wackiest years imaginable, in which he played for two head coaches, was benched twice, was hailed as a savior and doused with scorn, prompted Washington’s most exciting season in a generation and slogged through Washington’s worst    campaigns in 20 years. No matter who was to blame, Griffin was the subject of countless anonymously sourced reports, dominated social media, and ensured that the Redskins were a fixture on   shows, Web sites and television programs around the country.   [Robert Griffin III signs with the Browns]   Maybe the only quarterback who prompted more heated arguments without playing in a Super Bowl over the last four years was that kid with the catchy nickname and the love of Vegas, the one whose every utterance guaranteed a slew of headlines and stories that readers would complain about even as they voraciously devoured. And now Johnny Football will pass the Cleveland quarterbacking torch to Griffin. The pass will land out of bounds. Then Griffin will injure himself trying to pick it up. Take away the jokes and hyperbole, and in some ways, this is an ideal landing spot for Griffin. The expectation levels will be one or two notches above nuclear winter; if Griffin starts, say, 12 games and the Browns flirt with . 500, he might be posing for another statue. He had also talked with the Jets; a move to New York would have meant dozens of   tabloid appearances and weekly recitations of his famous farewell note.   [Griffin departs Redskins knocked down, but not out]   Had he gone to Denver or San Francisco, Griffin would be measured against very recent Super Bowl campaigns; in Cleveland he’ll be measured against a fetid pool of sadness. And if he fails, much of his failure will be attributed to general Clevelandness, his   career laid to rest next to the wreckage of Weeden and Wynn, Frye and Quinn. But that’s being reasonable. This is no time for reason. This is a time to note with astonishment that after being drafted by a sometimes dysfunctional franchise coming off three straight losing seasons and four straight   finishes  —   and after briefly reviving that organization  —   Griffin is now joining a frequently dysfunctional franchise coming off eight straight losing seasons and five straight   finishes. You’ve heard of going from the penthouse to the outhouse; this is going straight into the potty itself. Since Griffin entered the NFL, the Browns are   tied for the   mark in the NFL. Over that span, Cleveland quarterbacks rank 30th in passing touchdowns, 30th in completion percentage, 27th in interceptions and 25th in sacks.   [Former NFL head coach says Griffin’s issues are ‘from the neck up’]   The Browns are on their fourth head coach in five seasons. They have the NFL’s   playoff drought. Since returning to the NFL in 1999, they have the league’s fewest points, worst scoring differential and worst record. Some RGIII fans hoped he might stumble into stability and quiet at his next stop. Instead, he stumbled into a rave filled with   in dog masks throwing balloons filled with spoiled milk. Sometime next fall, Griffin seems likely to become the 26th quarterback to attempt a pass for the Browns over the last 16 seasons. You know how many of them left Cleveland with a winning record? Try one: Brian Hoyer, he of the magisterial   mark. Maybe Griffin doesn’t need to flirt with . 500 to get that statue; flirting with . 400 should earn him at least a parade. This is to say nothing of his weapons; Griffin is leaving DeSean Jackson and Jordan Reed and joining, um, Brian Hartline and Gary Barnidge. Or of his competition; he’s leaving a division where all four teams finished in the bottom half of the league in DVOA last year, and joining a division where Cincinnati and Pittsburgh were in the top third, and Baltimore typically joins them. Or of his predecessors; Washington’s previous   quarterback, Jason Campbell, made the final starts of his NFL career in Cleveland. He played through injury there; the NFL never gave him another chance to start.   [Fancy Stats: Griffin could be worse than he was with Redskins]   “You fight through that type of stuff, and then they’re like ‘We don’t care no more,’” Campbell told me in the fall. “It feels like we’re just a paper bag they just crumble up and throw away. ” Teams are allowed to reboot; look at what the Redskins did in 2015, or what they did with Griffin in 2012. Players are allowed to reboot, too. Griffin is joining a coach with a history of bringing out the best in quarterbacks. He should be healthy after a year of running hills at Redskins Park, and he probably won’t need to worry about befriending Cleveland’s owner, because who would want to be friends with Jimmy Haslam? But the fact remains: when the Redskins drafted Griffin, more than a few people worried he was going to the NFL’s least hospitable landing spot for a promising quarterback. This week, he might have done worse. My friend Matt Johnson, who designs   that jab at the tender spots in a sports fan’s soul, sells two varieties that list more than 20 starting quarterbacks for NFL teams, men who have come and gone like so many Griffin hashtags. Those two teams? One is the Redskins. The other is the Browns.

"Trump’s proverb, Paul Ryan’s ‘despicable’ pint and other St. Patrick’s Day mishaps.          The day began with a   mildly offensive Irish cliche in front of a roomful of Irish people, and it all went downhill from there. “Top of the morning,” said Vice President Pence, as he hosted Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny at his residence for breakfast Thursday. Really? The reaction by Irish on social media was palpable. “Literally just shouted ‘NOBODY SAYS THAT’ at the TV,” a journalist in Ireland tweeted. “I’ve literally only ever heard that said by Americans,” another person said. “How do all the Irish people not just go, ‘Nope,’ and leave the room?” tweeted another. Ireland’s leader was in Washington for a series of events in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day, including breakfast with the vice president, a luncheon at the U. S. Capitol, a    meeting with President Trump and a   annual ceremony in which the U. S. president is presented with a bowl of shamrocks.    Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, rights, presents a traditional gift of a bowl of shamrocks to President Trump at the White House. (Jonathan  )  Long before the festivities began, the visit was controversial in Ireland. Almost 40, 000 people signed a petition titled “Shamrock for Trump: Not in my name,” demanding that Kenny cancel the trip. During the U. S. presidential campaign, Kenny criticized Trump for his “racist and dangerous” language. Even so, the Irish leader followed through with the annual tradition on Thursday, prompting his staff and more than 20 Irish reporters to fly eight hours across the Atlantic to listen to the “Taoiseach deliver his   son of the sainted shamrock routine along the east coast of America,” as the Irish Times phrased it. (Taoiseach, pronounced,   or   is the Irish language title of the prime minister.) And as the day went on, the awkward and at times embarrassing Irish cultural references from Washington politicians were nearly as bountiful as their green neckties.   [Three Irish musicians say ‘No, Nay, Never’ to White House on St. Patrick’s Day]   At the luncheon, Trump shared a proverb. “As we stand together with our Irish friends, I’m reminded of that proverb  —   and this is a good one, this is one I like, I’ve heard it for many, many years and I love it,” Trump said. “Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue, but never forget to remember those that have stuck by you. ” Irish tweeters immediately displayed skepticism.   Have literally never heard this in my entire life. https:  .   —   Christine Bohan (@ChristineBohan) March 16, 2017     With all due respect to the president’s reputation for scrupulously checking his sources, I don’t think this is an Irish proverb. https:  .   —   The Irish For 🏌🐕 (@theirishfor) March 16, 2017   A White House spokeswoman told the Hill newspaper that the proverb was originally supplied in an email on March 8 by the State Department via the National Security Council “as building blocks in advance of this event. ” She said the “building blocks” were provided in the context of the shamrock ceremony and were ultimately used in the prepared remarks at the luncheon. While a number of websites, Pinterest boards and books do, indeed, refer to the quote as an “Irish blessing,” its origin was unclear. In fairness, Trump never actually claimed it was of Irish origin but that’s how many took it in the context of the moment. Across social media, many pointed out that a poem by Nigerian poet Albashir Adam Alhassan includes a similar stanza.   Trump’s Irish poet, Albashir Adam Alhassan, is Nigerian. Also, a proverb is not a poem. #ArtFunding #IrishProverb #IrishLiterature  —   amy (@aharbo) March 16, 2017   The irony of the mishaps was that Trump has surrounded himself with Irish Americans, from presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway to press secretary Sean Spicer. Two of the leading Republicans involved in Thursday’s cultural gaffes  —   Pence and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .)  —   identify as Irish American. Ryan introduced both Trump and Kenny at the luncheon, praising the United States’ relationship with Ireland and lauding the nation for “all she has given us. ” One of his statements caused a fair bit of  : “Americans, especially American Irish, are always trying to endear ourselves to the Irish. Think about it. We went from a president who plays a lot of golf to a president who owns a lot of golf courses,” Ryan said. “That is about the closest thing you can get to royalty in Ireland. ” Trump, indeed, owns a golf course in Ireland and has golfed on various courses at least nine times since taking office. And he recently played 18 holes with pro golfer Rory McIlroy, who is from Northern Ireland. But aside from that connection, some Irish people questioned the reference to royalty and golf, a sport that originated in Scotland.   Paul Ryan: thinks golf was invented in Ireland, thinks mentioning Ireland and royalty is a good idea. Nobody likes him.  —   Wallace Wylie (@WallaceWylie) March 16, 2017   But perhaps the most “appalling” moment of the day for some came as Ryan offered a toast, in honor of Ireland’s visit. While addressing the luncheon, Ryan suddenly pulled out a   pint of Guinness beer from under the podium. “To what our forefathers have started and our children will continue, may the light always shine upon them. Sláinte. ” The speaker may have used the correct word for the toast, but all Irish Guinness enthusiasts could focus on was that “despicable pint. ” Anyone who has lived in or traveled to Ireland knows the law of the land: a dark, Irish beer should always be topped with a creamy, white, thick foam. One person tweeted she would be “ashamed” to be seen holding that pint. It looked like a pint “you find in the smoking area at the end of the night, its owner stumbled home long ago,” said another. The Irish news website the Journal summed it up this way: “Some questionable Guinness pouring going on in Washington by the looks of Paul D. Ryan’s pint. ”   First Mike Pence says ’top of the morning’ then Paul Ryan holds up this appalling pint, grave missteps by the US pic. twitter.   —   Naomi O’Leary (@NaomiOhReally) March 16, 2017   Correction: This post has been updated to reflect the fact that President Trump did not explicitly claim the proverb was Irish in origin, as the original version of this story stated.

"Trump chastises fellow NATO members, demands they meet payment obligations.   BRUSSELS  —   President Trump exported the confrontational,  nationalist rhetoric of his campaign across the Atlantic on Thursday, scolding European leaders for not footing more of the bill for their own defense and lecturing them to stop taking advantage of U. S. taxpayers. Speaking in front of a twisted shard of the World Trade Center at NATO’s gleaming new headquarters in Brussels, Trump upbraided America’s longtime allies for “not paying what they should be paying. ” He used a ceremony dedicating the memorial to NATO’s resolve in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States as a platform to exhort leaders to “focus on terrorism and immigration” to ensure their security. And he held back from the one pledge NATO leaders most wanted to hear: an unconditional embrace of the organization’s solemn treaty commitment that an attack on a single alliance nation is an attack on all of them. Instead, European leaders gazed unsmilingly at Trump while he said that “2S. president started his journey in Saudi Arabia and moved on to Israel and Italy.    Caption   The U.

"The one word separating this Lundqvist from the great Lundqvist. For the last 11 seasons, the Rangers have gone where Henrik Lundqvist has taken them. It will be no different this year. But here we are, almost   into   following a   in which the Blueshirts spent the first 29 minutes committing felonies against hockey aesthetics while being outshot   and the King’s game hasn’t quite been where it is needed for his team to make noise come spring. It isn’t as if Lundqvist’s game has broken down. But there are just these shots that seem to go in almost out of nowhere  —   the   bouncer in Buffalo on Thursday, for example  —   when they wouldn’t have a year or two or seven ago. Or maybe they would have, given the Swede’s track record of building his game out of the gate and peaking over seasons’ second halves and in the playoffs, with last year a notable exception to the rule. The Rangers still haven’t won a game in which they have scored two or fewer goals, even unable to hold a     lead in this one for more than 32 seconds after they had earned it, Lundqvist beaten on a Victor Rask low dart from 50 feet away at 6:26. It seemed the kind of shot the goaltender would stop when at the top of his game.         Which Lundqvist is not. Not always. Not yet. Not with a . 918    save percentage that is not only 15th in the NHL and markedly below last season’s . 934 (that was recorded in the face of perpetually criminally negligent defensive zone work) but well below the composite . 931 he has posted since   which is the best in the league among goaltenders who have played at least 350 games. And yes, it is true the Rangers allow the      shots in the league per game (24. 5) but that doesn’t quite explain the ones that are getting away   …     or getting through. What does? Lundqvist has said it before and he said it again after preserving the victory the Blueshirts ultimately gained on a pair of goals from Chris Kreider at 12:25 and 17:11 that represented the Boston College product’s second and third scores in his last 17 games. “Focus,” is what he said. “Focus. ” “That’s everything for me,” Lundqvist told The Post. “My game is all about focus. If I were a goalie who went down to my knees and used my size, it would be more about technique. But for me, it’s much more about my reads and my decisions. “When I make a misread, I’m in trouble. It’s tricky with your mind not to be ahead of the play and to stay in the moment, but that’s the key for me. ” Again, it is critical to state Lundqvist’s game has not fallen apart. Critical to state he and his contract are not dooming the Rangers. And also critical to remind potential   and scapegoat hunters Lundqvist has been through stretches like this before. Indeed, this is reminiscent of   Alain Vigneault’s first season behind the New York bench, in which Lundqvist struggled through the first three months of the year. Through Jan. 6  —   and when he was just 31, by the way  —   the King recorded a positively plebeian . 906 save percentage and a 2. 78   average while going   . Indeed, for the first and only time of his career, Lundqvist was a healthy backup for three straight games (to Cam Talbot) late that December. But thereafter   …     well, Lundqvist kicked it into gear the rest of the way, going . 934, 1. 96 and    beginning with a sterling   performance that Jan. 8 in Chicago. And with the goaltender on top of his game, the Rangers went to the Cup final. Or maybe he just put it all into focus. The takeaway from this one is more how the Rangers salvaged this game with a strong   push both to take the lead on Michael Grabner’s   goal at 5:54 and then to preserve the edge after Kreider struck for the first time. “It’s very important for me and for the team to close out tight games like this,” Lundqvist said after the Rangers’ fourth victory (  ) in their last nine games. “Personally, and as a team, you get confidence from that. “I do feel confident. There are a lot of parts of my game that I’m really happy with. It’s just that focus, I talked about. It’s difficult to explain how I get it, but I know how. I’ve done it before. ” For 11 seasons.",1.0
"Russian spy ship spotted ‘loitering’ off Connecticut coast.

"Corporate America shuffles away from pure conservatism.  You can have your Coke with a smile today. On Monday, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a conservative Republican, said he would veto a bill that would have legalized discrimination against gay people, responding to an outcry from corporate interests including   Home Depot, UPS, Walt Disney, Delta, Time Warner, Comcast, Netflix, Apple and the National Football League. As state legislators pushed the “religious liberty” bill through, Deal told them: “I hope that we can all just take a deep breath, recognize that the world is changing around us. ”  Headlines of the past week show seemingly contradictory developments: Even as Georgia’s governor took a bold stand against discrimination, North Carolina’s Republican governor last Wednesday signed into law similar legislation enshrining discrimination again lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents.  But there is really no contradiction: Georgia’s governor vetoed the bill because it received massive public exposure and there was a resulting outcry from corporations concerned that it would offend customers and workers. North Carolina’s governor signed the bill literally in the dark of night, just before the Easter holiday weekend, after legislators introduced and passed it in a single day at a hastily convened special session  —   essentially slipping it into law before it could get attention and business interests could state their objections. In both cases, you can see the effects of a new corporate citizenship that is emerging. Corporate America is traditionally conservative, reluctant to react to social controversy and divisive issues. But as public sentiment shifts dramatically on gay rights and as   millennials become a large bloc of consumers, business is shedding its reticence. This has happened, to a lesser extent, on immigration, various environmental issues and, recently, in support of Apple’s stand for consumer privacy.      Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal announced he will veto a religious freedom bill passed by the state legislature that has drawn national criticism for discriminating against   couples. (Reuters)   Democrats and progressives see potential for a larger shift nationally in corporate political behavior, as Republicans take ideological stands on education, the   Bank, the debt ceiling and infrastructure spending that put them at odds with their traditional corporate allies. “They’re just not offering companies what they crave most out of Washington, which is predictability,” said Matt Bennett of Third Way, a   Democratic group. Republicans “are just these wild cards now,” he said, and will become more so if Donald Trump  —   who talks of 45 percent tariffs  —   becomes their nominee. Though it’s not clear whether that broader shift to the left will occur among corporations, there is no doubt that a dramatic change has occurred on gay rights. When the Georgia legislature took up legislation giving religious groups the right to deny services to gay people, corporations by the dozen voiced their objections. Disney and Netflix said they would stop filming in Georgia, and the NFL said the bill would jeopardize Atlanta’s hopes of hosting the Super Bowl.   Deal said he wouldn’t “respond well” to “threats of withdrawing jobs from our state,” but respond he did. On Monday, he said the religious community’s request for government protection is “ironic,” because if “indeed our religious liberty is conferred by God and not by   government, we should heed the ‘ ’ admonition of the First Amendment. ” In North Carolina, Pat McCrory and state Republicans tried to avoid the trouble Deal faced, and the similar trouble Indiana Gov. Mike Pence faced in 2014.  North Carolina’s bill, passed and signed within 12 hours of its introduction, invalidates municipal nondiscrimination ordinances, including a Charlotte city ordinance covering transgender people’s use of restrooms. Lawmakers also passed a statewide nondiscrimination policy that omits protection for sexual orientation.  American Airlines, Apple, Dow Chemical, PayPal and others rushed to criticize the new law. The National Basketball Association suggested it might move its 2017   Game from Charlotte. On Tuesday, more than 80 top executives from   companies signed a letter to McCrory saying the legislation is “bad for our employees and bad for business” and will “make it far more challenging for businesses across the state to recruit” and will “diminish the state’s draw as a destination for tourism, new businesses and economic activity. ” The letter, coordinated by Human Rights Campaign, a   group, was signed by, among others, executives from Levi Strauss, Apple, Marriott, Pfizer, Google, Yahoo, Biogen, Microsoft and Facebook.  McCrory, peppered during a press conference Monday about all the municipal ordinances the new law would overturn, complained that the reporters were “blindsiding” him. If he didn’t want to be blindsided by his own law’s effects, he could have spent more than one day on it. But McCrory, unlike the   Deal, is up for reelection and likely hopes the issue will rally his conservative supporters.  Now North Carolina will face the economic consequences of his poor choice. McCrory should have done what Georgia’s Deal proposed: take a deep breath, and recognize that the world is changing.

"iPhone Battery Scandal: Apple Had Way Better Options Than Slowing Down Your Phone. On Wednesday, Apple confirmed what many customers have long suspected: The company has been slowing the performance of older iPhones. Apple says it started the practice a year ago, to compensate for battery degradation, rather than push people to upgrade their smartphones faster. But even giving that benefit of the doubt, there are plenty of better ways Apple could have accomplished the same goal without betraying customer trust. Earlier this week, John Poole, a developer at Geekbench, published a blog post indicating that a change in iOS is slowing down performance on older devices. According to Apple, factors like low charge, cold climates, and natural battery degradation can all affect the performance of its mobile devices, and the company confirmed that this policy was implemented last year to counteract these effects. As much sense as that explanation may make, Apple could have made plenty of choices that would have benefited consumers instead of penalizing them. These same choices could have also saved the company from the public shaming it suffered this week. In a statement to WIRED, Apple confirmed Poole's findings, saying it was purposely slowing down older iPhones to compensate for the effects of age on their batteries. ""Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,"" the company says. While many have speculated that the company has been doing this for years, Apple says the feature was implemented last year for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone SE. Now, with iOS 11.2, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are getting the same treatment, and the company intends to bring other devices into the fold down the road. Rather than secretly hamstring the iPhone's CPU, though, Apple could have simply educated users about the limitations of lithium-ion batteries, says Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, a company that sells repair kits and posts repair guides for consumer electronics. While Apple does say in the iPhone user manual that batteries degrade over time and should be replaced, you'd have to dig through a few links outside of the manual to learn that by 500 charge cycles, your phone's battery will hold a charge of about 80 percent. Another tactic Apple could employ is selling battery replacement kits to consumers, letting them pop a fresh battery into their aging iPhone. It would be an easily understandable solution to an easily understandable problem, rather than software manipulation that feeds into a long-running, planned obsolescence conspiracy theory. But Apple has actively fought against laws that would require it to provide a way for users to repair their devices. According to a report from HuffPost, Apple argues that allowing consumers to replace the battery could make the iPhone more vulnerable to hacks, and that letting people peek inside would make the iPhone easier to counterfeit. ""Apple won't sell batteries to consumers, people should be furious about that,"" Wiens says. ""Your battery is a maintenance item, and everyone should expect to replace their battery fairly frequently."" Apple does cover one battery replacement under its one-year warranty program, but only for ""defective batteries,"" a term that isn't clearly defined on the company's site. If your phone is out of warranty and you don't have an AppleCare+ plan, the company offers a battery replacement for $79 plus a $6.95 shipping charge. The problem, Wiens says, is that Apple doesn't advertise this policy to consumers, leaving iPhone users to believe that the only solution is to buy a costly iPhone. Direct battery fixes certainly would have made the most sense. But even allowing that a software tweak was the only way Apple could have proceeded—untrue, but just for argument's sake—it had a much better option than making its software solution covert. Rather than quietly push out an update that crimped older iPhones, it should have made that throttling opt-in. As it stands, there's no way to avoid having your phone slowed down once the battery reaches its limits. By giving users the choice, and giving them the information necessary to make their own decision, Apple could avoid the frustrations many have expressed over the policy. While making the throttling opt-in could cause performance issues for users who opt-out, it would give users a sense of control over the situation and avoid making them feel like they're being tricked into buying a new phone. As it stands, Apple's move comes off as deceptive. Instead of leaving users confused about why their phones are suddenly slowing to a crawl, Apple could take user education a step further by providing a battery health monitor in the Settings app. That way, an iPhone owner could figure out if the battery is the issue, or if something else is going on. The damage, unfortunately, is already done. But it's also unlikely that Apple will behave differently going forward. At the very least, the company almost certainly won't shift gears and start selling battery replacement kits to consumers. For starters, the iPhone's casing uses proprietary Pentalobe screws, which make it hard for average users to get inside to swap the battery. Apple has also lobbied against right-to-repair legislation, which would allow third-party repair shops and typical consumers to more easily fix their broken phones. Proposed right-to-repair laws typically require companies to publish their repair manuals, as well as make the necessary repair tools available for purchase rather than requiring a specialist to make these repairs. Wiens says that, ideally, right-to-repair legislation would pass and ensure consumers have the ability to fix their devices on their own terms without having to deal with warranties or acquire difficult-to-find tools. Apple's throttling is misleading, and it's far from the best way the company could have handled the situation. Still, lithium-ion batteries are riddled with problems users should be aware of. The company isn't likely to change its stance on the matter, but if you've noticed your iPhone getting slower over the last year, at least you know it wasn't all in your head—and that a battery fix might bring your iPhone back up to speed.",0.0
"Audi's High-Tech Laser Matrix Headlights Aren't Welcome in the US.

"Big's Backyard Ultra and the Rise of Women Endurance Stars. On Monday evening, Maggie Guterl and Will Hayward set out for the 60th time on a 4-mile loop through the hickory-covered hills of central Tennessee. It was dark and rainy on day three of the Big’s Backyard Ultra, a running race of fiendish design. There's no set distance, and no set total time, just endless laps around the 4-mile course, which participants must complete once an hour. To win, you basically just have to be the last competitor still moving your legs. For hours Guterl and Hayward had been the only two runners left. They could theoretically have gone on forever. Guterl finished her loop, and the crowd watched to see if Hayward's head lamp would split the darkness, leading him in before the clock ticked 60. But as the final ""time's almost up!"" warning whistles blew, no shards of light glimmered on the trail. He'd gotten a little lost mid-circuit, and Guterl became the first woman victor in one of running's most epic, masochistic events. “i figure everyone already knows / but if you are living in a cave / maggie guterl of colorado won the 2019 world championship of backyard ultra at the big's backyard ultra,” the race director, Gary Cantrell (aka Lazarus Lake), wrote in an almost poetic post on Facebook. The ""backyard"" in the race title, by the way, is his backyard. “not the women's world championship / the world championship of everybody, period.” Guterl was once a regular, midpack road runner who wandered onto a trail on a run in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, one day. After that, she took on more trail races, powered through longer trail races, got a coach, and now finds herself a world champion. With this victory, she joined a small but growing cadre of women athletes who are competing with elite men, and winning. Endurance sports may not exactly be a level physiological (or social) playing field, but women do earn, as Guterl did, top overall spots in the most grueling events—which they wouldn’t in, say, sprinting. These long-slog races aren’t all about gigantic lung capacity and muscle measurements. They’re also about repetition, pacing, fatigue so extreme you get zombie eyes, hormone fluctuations, spiraling thoughts, high highs, low lows—and, mostly, not listening to that voice in your head that says, “You could just stop.” The phrase “Big’s Backyard Ultra” may sound like the quirky, sweat of the Earth name of one particular race. And it is that. But others have generalized the format into a lowercase ""backyard ultra"" style of race, each of which follows the same format. Racers must run a 4.166667-mile (6,706-meter) loop in under an hour. They can do it a half-hour, or they can clock in at 59:59. As long as they cross that line before the clock ticks 60, they remain in play (although if they finish in 30 minutes, they have more time to, say, sit down for a sec, sip some coffee, and pop some aspirin). Exactly one hour after a circuit starts, another begins, and racers set off on what ultrarunner Andy Pearson called in Trail Runner Magazine “a macabre, Sisyphean loop.” The last person who completes the proverbial boulder-pushing, after everyone else has dropped off, wins. Cantrell says the basic idea for the format—essentially a 4 mph race—goes back to his high-school running days. ""I was not fast, but I could withstand a lot of abuse,"" he says. ""This would be a race I could win."" After he bought this land in Tennessee, he decided he wanted to hold an ultra race there and built trails through his woods. ""The parameters were to make it where it was easy enough to do that anyone could do it—but hard enough to do that, after a while, it would be difficult,"" he says. People liked it, replicated it. ""The majority of people who run backyard ultras are just people who like the low-key atmosphere,"" adds Cantrell. ""Not having to push really fast."" Plus, in long-course ultramarathons, you might not see a single other person for hours. In a backyard ultra, the field doesn't spread as far, and everyone hangs out together (in chairs) every hour at the start/finish line. It's a party. Cantrell keeps a spreadsheet that currently lists 75 backyard ultras between late August 2019 and September 2020, although he notes their grassroots nature makes them hard to track. In a less official Google spreadsheet, data nerds can check out race maps, attrition rates for different events, and all-time records. The races now take place in the US and all over the world, including Denmark, Dubai, Estonia, Sweden, Russia, Ukraine, and elsewhere. Cantrell says he attends five or six other races a year—just for fun. Cantrell is also famous for the torturous Barkley Marathons, chronicled in a documentary subtitled “The Race That Eats Its Young,"" which also takes place in Tennessee. “Many who have suffered through Barkley can attest that Laz is a true artist,” Pearson wrote. “The Leonardo da Vinci of pain. The Rembrandt of mind games. The Lady Gaga of suffering. A master of sadomasochistic craft.” Just before this year’s event, Cantrell made an ominous Facebook post about Big's participants. “they are coming / like turtles crossing oceans to lay their eggs / like monarchs crossing continents to return to their home forests / they are coming / driven by some invisible thing inside them / they are coming,” he wrote. “… god help them one and all.” Cantrell's line-broken posts read like Appalachian proverbs. After the race began, for instance, he noted on Facebook the many messages of support that loved ones were leaving for competitors, as they watched the video streaming from Cantrell's property. ""i wonder if any of them have the least idea that their friends and families, and even people they do not know, are so invested in seeing them succeed?,"" he wrote, ""or are they, here on the big farm in short creek tennessee, surrounded by nothing but trees, as oblivious as microbes on a slide to the fact they are being watched?” Guterl, like women achieving major things anywhere, was likely very aware of the microscope. There aren’t many sports in which women can compete alongside with men and win podium spots. But endurance events present an exception to that general rule. Take Pam Reed, who won multiple Badwater Ultramarathons, which sends racers across 135 miles from Death Valley to the Mount Whitney trailhead. Or Amelia Boone—who, by the way, ran the 2019 Big’s Backyard and cheered Guterl on after she herself dropped—who came in second overall at the 2012 World’s Toughest Mudder. And then there’s Rory Bosio, who in 2013 placed seventh overall in the North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, beating the women’s record by 2.5 hours and making herself the first woman in the top 10 finishers. The records aren't just in endurance running. In 2016, cyclist Lael Wilcox won the 4,300-mile Trans Am, and in 2018—as the second woman ever to compete—she came in second in the Navad 1000 “bikepacking” race. Outside magazine’s “the Longer the Race, the Stronger We Get” details these victories, along with one 2016 weekend when “women runners took five outright victories in ultramarathons across the country."" On average, men still outperform women in ultra races. But it’s hard to tell exactly how the genders compare, in part because the demographics of ultra-ing still skew heavily male. According to a 2018 Frontiers in Physiology review paper, 100-mile races in the US had almost no women participants in the late 1970s. By 2010 women accounted for about 20 percent of the contenders. Men were always, on average, faster—but the degree of sex difference in performance was highest when the ratio of women to men was smaller. Logic suggests that if more women (or fewer men) participated, the average difference would decrease, at least to a point. Cantrell notes that women are disproportionately at the top of his backyard ultra. While they represented around 16 percent of all participants this year, when only four competitors remained, two were women. And when there was only one, it was Guterl. There are reasons why women might present a formidable challenge in endurance sports. Some research suggests women’s muscles might be less fatiguable than men’s. Women tend to have more slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are better at longer-lasting tasks. Women can also access and use their stores of fat, which metabolize more slowly than carbohydrates, better than men. In short, the extremes of athletic capacity that men exhibit just aren't as vital in the ultra world. ""Anything where speed and strength are a factor, the men will always be on top,"" says Cantrell. ""What I like about the backyard ultra is it removes the speed and strength from the equation."" Men and women can just battle it out. ""You have to be willing to keep stepping to the line even when it’s hard."" Gary Cantrell Then there's the psychology of these grinding affairs. We could wax philosophical about how women are better at handling the emotions and hardship of endurance sport, but there’s not much research to back up those squishy ideas. There does seem to be, though, a truth about how women perceive their abilities and parcel out their power: A 2016 Journal of Sports Analytics study looked at the predictions that male and female participants in the 2013 Houston Marathon made for themselves, and found that “men consistently overestimate their abilities relative to women.” Men also, in general, started out too quick and cut their pace in the backends of races, while women stayed steadier across the distance. Ultras break you down psychologically, but also physiologically. That 2018 review paper, called “Physiology and Pathophysiology in Ultramarathon Running,” sums this up in stark terms: “Undoubtedly, the completion of an ultramarathon has no immediate health benefits.” An ultramarathon can damage your red blood cells, in a process called hemolysis. Your cortisol jumps, as may other stress hormones called catecholamines. You tend to get more serotonin but less tryptophan. Testosterone dips. In women, estradiol—the estrogen steroid hormone that affects, among other things, the reproductive cycle—increases. Your liver and kidneys might not work as great as they would if you were standing still. Also, just try to have a normal digestive process. (No, really: We’ll wait.) Most of these potential fluctuations return to normal soon after the race, the effects fading away along like the feeling that someone had walloped your quads with a medieval morning star. In a blog post Guterl wrote last year, just before last year's Big’s Backyard Ultra, she said: ""I want to prove a woman can win this. If my body can hang with my mind then we will be OK. This is going to be hard and I will need more than pure stubbornness (of which I have endless amounts.)” That year she ran (a mere) 183 miles, or 44 loops. And then she signed up to do it all over again. For ultra addicts, the call of the wild, the call of the difficult, and the call of the angel-devil dueling voices in your head—""you could just stop” or “you could just keep going”—lead you straight back to www.ultrasignup.com. You click “Register.” And on race day, you line up with everyone else. Yeah, you're nervous, but not about your estradiol. More important than any other backyard quality, says Cantrell, is this: ""You have to be willing to keep stepping to the line even when it’s hard."" As Guterl and Hayward dueled this past weekend, Cantrell posted about that struggle. “she has to be wondering what it will take to put this guy away,” he wrote. “he simply refuses to surrender.” She refused harder. Several hours after that post, Guterl crossed the final line, an inflatable arch with the words “There Is NO” scrawled above the printed “FINISH,” for the last time. She’d been on the course for around 60 hours and had traveled 250 miles, ending up exactly where she’d started in space but with a new way to think of herself, and for everyone else to think about her: world champion of everybody, period.",0.0

"What will it take for Democrats to woo the white working class?.  Democrats from President Obama on down are blaming their 2016 debacle in part on too much “identity politics”  —   messaging aimed not at voters broadly, but at Latinos, women, African Americans and the LGBT community as groups. The one group Democrats did not target were their old mainstays,    whites (especially the males of that species) who responded by giving Donald Trump a margin of 39 points over Hillary Clinton, while voters of color failed to vote for her in the expected numbers.  According to much newly minted conventional wisdom, Democrats can and should win back downscale whites by cranking up economic populism, without losing minorities, women and other key components of their coalition.  “We need to speak to their economic interests, that we get it, that we understand, that we talk about those things and we try to fight hard for those things,” said Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) who is challenging Rep. Nancy Pelosi of   San Francisco for leadership of House Democrats. Easier said than done. Consider: Rust Belt states that Trump turned red  —   Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan  —   heavily rely on coal for their electricity. Ohio and Pennsylvania also mine it. Some in those states likely backed the Republican partly out of opposition to Obama’s crackdown on coal, the Clean Power Plan, which Clinton supported.  Democrats could modify their climate change policy, in the name of protecting coal jobs and lower utility bills; good for the working class of all races. That would infuriate green voters  —   and donors  —   on the East and West coasts. It’ll never happen. At a deeper level, Trump tapped unease among   whites that is related not to economics but to culture and race: in a word, identity.  A diverse society brings great benefits  —   social, cultural and economic. Urban Americans experience these daily. Life brims with new experiences, challenges, excitement, what an economist would call “positive externalities” of demographic change. Yet homogeneity has benefits too. In rural areas, or small towns, where everyone speaks the same language, or practices the same customs, life can be simpler, more predictable, less frictional. Economists call these “compositional amenities,” and many people value them above the benefits of diversity  —   even above economic gains. In a 2009 paper, a U. S.  trio of social scientists led by David Card of the University of California at Berkeley used survey data from 21 countries to show that concern for compositional amenities is much more important in explaining public opinion on immigration than economic concerns, such as immigration’s impact on wages and taxes.  Anxiety about cultural change can, and often does, outweigh evidence on immigration’s economic impact  —   even positive data showing immigration actually raises wages overall, or that undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes.  The study found that “compositional concerns” rise as educational attainment falls. As you acquire more skills and information, it becomes easier, presumably, to adapt to an increasingly diverse culture. And the converse also holds.  The analysis (previously reported by Thomas B. Edsall of the New York Times) was based on survey data from Europe over a decade ago. Still, the fact that the Card team’s findings applied across different societies on that continent suggests relevance to the United States, too  —   as does the fact that Trump just got himself elected president with overwhelming support from    whites in smaller cities and rural counties by telling them he would build a wall on the Mexican border, impose “extreme vetting” on   immigrants and deport large numbers of the undocumented.  A General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, would have closed but for Obama’s rescue of the auto industry; Trump won the surrounding county by six points.  The Democrats’ dilemma, then, is this: They can make only limited political gains with an economic pitch to the white working class, unless they adjust on immigration and other issues of identity too, probably.  Yet this would require compromising on what the party defined as matters of basic justice and tolerance, and turn off voters from their racially and ethnically diverse “coalition of the ascendant. ”  Indeed, some on the left are already warning that conceding on identity politics would be a capitulation to “white supremacy,” in the words of Columbia law school professor Katherine Franke.  It’s an understandable impulse  —   no concessions to this demagogue. And Democrats may end up doubling down on identity politics because of it.  The question is whether this will prove effective, or prove to many whites that Democrats just don’t understand them, or care to; certainly Trump will encourage them to think so. The alternative, of course, is to appeal to the public on the basis of our common American identity, and aspirations, rather than our overlapping grievances  —   cultural, racial, economic or otherwise.  For the time being, no leader or party shows any interest in that. The one that eventually does, though, might own the political future, if we still have one.

"This is the whiff of a rebirth of the best rivalry in sports. Jason Varitek shoving his glove into Alex Rodriguez’s mug is a distant memory. Don Zimmer looking for Pedro Martinez on Fenway Park’s grass and winding up on the ground reminds everyone how high the level of hatred was that existed between the Yankees and Red Sox. A little life has leaked out of what used to be the best rivalry in sports because the blood rivals haven’t faced each other in October since the 2004 ALCS, when the Yankees flushed a   lead one year after Aaron Boone won Game 7 of the ALCS with what many believe to be the biggest home run in Yankees history. But now, the Red Sox and Yankees are   in the AL East after Memorial Day for the first time since July 6, 2013, with the Yankees holding a   lead over the   Red Sox as they play host to Boston on Tuesday night for the first of a   series. Four years ago it was the Red Sox on top by five games, when the Yankees lost that night and dropped from second to fourth. Sure, it’s only early June, but until the analytic crowd finds a formula to determine all 162 games don’t count equally, these three games qualify as the biggest of the season so far. “We are kind of trained to treat each [game on the schedule] equally because each one means the same, but obviously the history with the Red Sox and the rivalry, we always look forward to playing them,’’ Brett Gardner said. In late April, a   series in Boston was shortened to two by rain and the Yankees won,   behind Luis Severino, and   thanks to Masahiro Tanaka’s   shutout and his outpitching Chris Sale. Severino won’t work against the Red Sox, but every eye in the Yankees’ universe will be locked on Tanaka on Tuesday. In six starts since dominating the Red Sox on April 27, Tanaka is   with an 8. 42 ERA in 31 innings and has allowed 48 hits while hitters have amassed a 1. 065 OPS against him. And that includes a   gem May 26, in which he gave up one run in 7   innings and lost. “This is no rebuild, it’s consistency, and it’s going to be a process to get him back to being consistent,” pitching coach Larry Rothschild said. “For three years, he hasn’t been out of sync. He is out of sync, and we are having trouble getting it back in consistently. It’s not like we have to redo the delivery. We just have to make sure he can repeat what he is doing. Really, I think it is simplifying things in his mind. ’’ Only a fool would believe the Red Sox, who scored 101 more runs than any AL team last season and are in the middle of the pack this season, aren’t missing David Ortiz. Still, CC Sabathia explained Ortiz’s aura remains alive even if the bat has vanished. “He was there for so long and such an impact on the clubhouse and he left a huge impression,’’ Sabathia said of the DH, who seemingly went    every time he saw the Yankees. “And they still have the same core. It’s not like when Jeet [Derek Jeter] left us, we had young players. They don’t have a bunch of young guys. ’’ While the Yankees won’t see Sale, they will face David Price on Thursday. Price was on the DL when the Yankees were in Boston. “They swung the bats well in Baltimore and obviously they got David Price back,’’ Joe Girardi said of the Red Sox, who will be without second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who is on the DL with a left wrist injury. “Obviously, it’s a big series. Right now it’s one big series after another. ’’",1.0
"Computer security experts fear second wave of ‘biggest ransomware attack ever’.  The malicious “ransomware” attacks that seized computers worldwide Friday and held those systems hostage are likely to worsen this week as millions of people return to work  —   forcing them to discover the hard way whether they have been affected, security analysts said. With much of the world still reeling from the digital breach that prevented people from receiving hospital care, a second wave of what European officials have called “the biggest ransomware attack ever” could be devastating. “They’re going to turn on their computers in the morning and find out if they were protected or not,” said James Barnett, a security expert at Venable and retired Navy rear admiral. The software, which first affected Britain’s National Health Service before spreading to as many as 150 countries, locked down victims’ computers and threatened to delete their files unless they paid $300 in bitcoins. It primarily targeted users of Windows XP, an aging operating system for which Microsoft largely ended support in 2014.  Much of the potential damage from Friday’s attack was quickly contained by the efforts of a     security researcher, who goes by @MalwareTechBlog on Twitter. The researcher discovered that the unnamed attackers had accidentally included a “kill switch” in their software that would allow the owner of a particular website to stop the attack. By paying about $10 to acquire the domain name, the researcher was able to thwart the malware. But that victory could be   experts said, because the software, known as WannaCry or Wanna Decryptor, is likely to be modified soon and continue its spread in a slightly different form. For IT workers and security researchers, the episode highlights the challenge of fighting an   foe whose motives are rarely clear. WannaCry is the most   example of a type of attack that analysts have been predicting would surge in 2017 after a substantial uptick in such attacks last year. “If you looked at what the biggest trends all the security companies were highlighting at the beginning of the year, ransomware was in all of their lists,” said Peter Warren Singer, a technologist and senior fellow at the New America Foundation. He added that interventions by independent researchers such as @MalwareTechBlog highlight the benefits of supporting private hacking. “If there is a lesson from that,” Singer said, it’s that “you want to enable security research and information exchange. You want the curiosity of the good guys to be unleashed as much as possible. ” Among those waking up Monday to a nasty surprise could be government officials, some analysts said. Many public computers still have Windows XP installed, and they could be susceptible to the malware if IT administrators have not downloaded the appropriate security patches. Some federal agencies have moved more quickly than others to stamp out Windows XP, said R. David Edelman, an Obama administration official who advised the White House on technology matters. How adept each agency has been at upgrading its systems has largely to do with available resources. “There are certainly still systems in the government that are running XP,” Edelman said. “Some of them are almost certainly  ; some of them might be further   or otherwise not as vulnerable. ” In 2015, the Navy agreed to pay Microsoft $9 million a year for continued Windows XP support. Since then, officials have sought to end the Navy’s reliance on outdated software by developing a “Microsoft Eradication Team. ” Now the Navy is moving rapidly to switch to Windows 10.  By this point, federal officials largely have a handle on XP, Singer said. But, he added, state and local governments that lack expertise or funding may face greater troubles. By drawing attention to the shortcomings of legacy computer systems, WannaCry could indirectly drive more demand to companies such as Google and Microsoft that have built massive cloud computing businesses, said Stewart Baker, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency.  “This may well force a lot of legacy systems finally into the cloud, is my guess,” Baker said, “which is probably where they’re going in the long run  —   but they’ll get there faster [now] because the idea of continuing to run XP is not credible. ” In a blog post Sunday, Microsoft chief legal officer Brad Smith said the incident highlights the dangers of stockpiling digital weapons, and called for a “Digital Geneva Conventions” to govern their use.  “The governments of the world should treat this attack as a   call,” Smith wrote. “They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world. ” ",-0.5
"Ford's Extra Special GT Supercar Is a Rolling Ode to American Dominance. When your car is already so exclusive that prospective customers must apply to buy one, apparently there is just one way of making it even more desirable: Make an even crazier version for exactly one person. Now, it's not like the Ford GT needed any improvement. It just walloped Ferrari, Aston Martin, Corvette, and Porsche to win its class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. But in the supercar realm, there's always someone who wants more. ",0.0
