"While You Were Offline: Trump&#8217;s Musical Ode to Insanity. 

Slide:  1 / of  1.

Caption: A supporter dons a Trump pin at a campaign rally in Lowell, Massachusetts. Corbis  It’s been a strange week on the Internet. The combination of the deaths of David Bowie and Alan Rickman, the State of the Union, and the possibility of winning a fortune thanks to a “power” “ball” overwhelmed the World Wide Web for the majority of the last few days, making things seem like even more of an emotional roller coaster than usual. But you already know about those things. Why don’t we talk about some of the other things you might have missed while all of that was going on? As ever, here are the highlights of some of the other things happening on the Internet over the last week. What Happened: The Oscar nominations were announced, and for a second year running, prompted the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media think pieces What Really Happened: The nominations for this year’s Academy Awards were announced Thursday, and as we pointed out, there was a distinct lack of nominees that weren’t white, despite 2015 offering up movies like Beasts of No Nation, Straight Outta Compton, Tangerine, and Creed. In fact, there were no people of color in any of the acting categories, which seems unthinkable. The oversight did not go unremarked–upon, unsurprisingly, leading to the return of the hashtag coined last year to mark the lack of diversity amongst Oscar nominees: #OscarsSoWhite. #OscarsSoWhite is back! Not a single person of color among the 20 acting nominees. And #StraightOuttaCompton no best picture. — John Horn (@JGHorn) January 14, 2016  
#OscarsSoWhite that Rocky got nominated in a movie about Apollo Creed’s son. — Hari Kondabolu (@harikondabolu) January 14, 2016

  There was even a spin-off hashtag, #OscarsSoWhiteAndStraight: @antovolk @onepanem not only are #OscarsSoWhite but #OscarsSoWhiteAndStraight — ˗ˏˋ mik(r)e(y) ˎˊ˗ (@FlNNPOEREY) January 14, 2016  
#OscarsSoWhiteAndStraight, because HOLLYWOOD’s so white, straight + male. SO sick and tired, IT’S TIME FOR CHANGE! — Francesca Cresswell (@fl_cresswell) January 14, 2016
  The #Academy once again shows that it is pale, male, and stale. #OscarsSoWhiteAndStraight — Dr. Ramani Durvasula (@DoctorRamani) January 14, 2016  The Takeaway: The unpicking of institutionalized bias (especially unconscious bias) in the Academy isn’t something that’s going to happen overnight, and it’s not as if the problem isn’t larger than just the Oscars. So what’s the solution? Sadly, probably a lot of frustration and patience as pressure from the outside slowly forces change. Be prepared for #OscarsSoWhite2017, is all we’re saying. What Happened: The militia that has taken over an Oregon government building asked the Internet for supplies. In return, the Internet sent sex toys. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, blogs What Really Happened: You’ve probably heard of Ammon Bundy and his gang of followers, who took over the Malheur wildlife refuge building back on Jan. 2 while the rest of us were recovering from New Year’s Day. You might even know that, days after they look over the government building, the militia turned to social media to ask for supplies. But it’s what happened next that was surprising. It started with an update from Jon Ritzheimer, one of the group, on Facebook: // <![CDATA[

// ]]&gt; It’s sad that there are people who would spend this kind of money on this rather than spending it to do good in the world. I’m done living in fear of an oppressing force. I’m going to uphold my oath to the Constitution and sleep great at night knowing that I did everything in my power to ensure what our founding fathers did for us will not be lost. To my family, I love you very much and I am sorry I can’t be there with you. Please look at this as a deployment, only this time I’m actually serving my country rather than being sent over seas to line the pockets of corrupt politicians. It is our sacrifice as a family that will make this country great again, not some election. And we are not alone. I am among some of the most honorable, and selfless people I have ever met. People who are dedicated to making the same sacrifice for this country. Read the constitution people. Get educated and don’t let your rights be taken. If your a Patriot and you feel the calling in your heart then all I can say is follow your heart. Don’t let the fear consume you. We all have lives but if we don’t make the sacrifice what kind of country are we leaving for our children. The status quo can’t go on any longer. We either take a stand against tyranny or we fail. Come be a part of history. And I am so proud that our country has become civilized enough that we can bring about change and right this wrong without any bloodshed. America is blessed. Posted by Jon Ritzheimer on Monday, January 11, 2016 Yes, Ritzheimer was appalled that people would “spend their money on hate”—although, really, sending dildos isn’t necessarily hate—but everyone else, it seemed, was thrilled, with the video unsurprisingly going viral almost immediately after it was posted. Twitter, similarly, was into the idea: To whoever mailed dildos and a literal bag of dicks to the #OregonMilitia, you are the heroes we deserve. — Theo Leigh (@1000DaysOfRain) January 12, 2016  
The fact that people are sending the Oregon Militia dildos is helping restore my faith in humanity. — Winter Hazu (@Hazukari) January 13, 2016

  Isn’t the Internet a wonderful place? The Takeaway: It looks like the message got through. And, you know, something besides the message. Some guy just sent the Oregon militia 55 gallons of lube to go with those dildos https://t.co/7zkpuFYoKW pic.twitter.com/9pW8G8GXau — Mashable (@mashable) January 14, 2016  What Happened: Donald Trump’s presidential nomination race unveiled its official jam. Your mind may be blown. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, media think pieces, blogs What Really Happened: There’s really no context we can give for this video, which appeared online Thursday:  OK, we can give you this context: It’s actually real. There is actually an “anthem” for Donald Trump, sung by three young kids, which goes “Cowardice/Are you serious?/Apologies for freedom/I can’t handle this” and, astonishingly, “Deal from strength or get crushed every time!” Of course, such musical wonder was speedily shared across the Internet, with Twitter finding itself somewhere between appalled and admiring:

Does anyone know when the official Leni Riefenstahl video of THE OFFICIAL DONALD TRUMP JAM is going to drop #Trump #ameritude — William Post IV (@willpostforfood) January 14, 2016
  The Takeaway: The very fact of this anthem’s existence feels like some wonderful, terrible omen about 2016 as an election year. As if we thought it was going to be crazy, but we haven’t even scratched the surface yet. How long before people start doing covers of this and posting them to YouTube? What Happened: A mother has knitted herself a replacement son, as an “art project.” No, this is not a joke. Where It Blew Up: Twitter, blogs What Really Happened: Meet Marieke Voorsluijsi, an everyday mother from the Netherlands who likes to knit. In fact, she likes to knit so much that she decided to knit a life-size version of her own son. Because that’s not strange at all, even though she likes to call it “a fun art family art project!” As the Internet shared the surreal and disturbing project, Twitter came to grips with the idea in its traditionally understated manner: It’s what any sane* person would do https://t.co/WFUERWMTel *unhinged — Adrian Evans (@stradeypark) January 14, 2016

This is sooooooo creepy. https://t.co/HPl0dvN6aC — Captain Tony (@RadioOnTheTony) January 14, 2016
  The Takeaway: Yeah, OK; this might be creepy, but also kind of tragic: What led to this woman deciding to try and replace her child with a Doctor Who monster waiting to happen? Shouldn’t the Internet be offering to send her affection and/or small animals to take care of, instead of complaints that she’s freaking us out? What Happened: The death of Alan Rickman led to a beloved quote going viral. The only problem was, the quote didn’t actually come from Alan Rickman. Where It Blew Up: Twitter What Really Happened: The unexpected death of Alan Rickman, coming so soon after the similarly unexpected death of David Bowie—both 69, both dead from cancer—broke the Internet Thursday, with social media flooded with loving tributes from fans who’d enjoyed his work in movies such as Die Hard, Truly Madly Deeply, and the Harry Potter series. It was his involvement with that latter series that prompted one of the most common tributes to appear, in fact: Alan Rickman may never see 80, but we will remember. Rest in peace, Professor. #always pic.twitter.com/V9zmnFfm1X — Cat O Broin (@magicgoeshere) January 14, 2016  
And he didn’t get the chance to reach 80. RIP, Alan Rickman. Our SNAPE. You will always be in our heart. ALWAYS. 😭💔⚡ pic.twitter.com/CCnNyepLZd — Bambie ツ (@pdlnbmbiena) January 14, 2016

  When I’ll be 80 years old and someone will ask me “you still miss Alan Rickman?” I will say “ALWAYS”. #RIPAlanRickman — ALAN COME BACK!!!! (@Sarah_Officialx) January 14, 2016  There’s just one problem: the quote didn’t come from Alan Rickman. Instead, it came from a Tumblr user called MyPatronusIsYou, who took to the site to claim ownership:    The Takeaway: Sure, the mix-up might have been embarrassing for those who had believed it was a genuine quote, but at least it launched another meme: In place of that fake Alan Rickman quote going around I’ve created this: pic.twitter.com/dB9jHVKkTj — TS Hendrik (@NotNotTSHendrik) January 14, 2016 ",0.0
"Only the Clintons: Bill’s speech was unlike anything we’ve ever seen.  As he stood at the lectern Tuesday night, Bill Clinton was doing more than delivering another convention speech, something he has done every four years spanning four decades. This was a larger moment for the former president, and it was a long time coming. In this one speech, he was essentially making good on a marital and political promissory note by employing the full measure of his rhetorical skills to boost his wife’s   week as the first woman to become a major party nominee. “In the spring of 1971 I met a girl,” Clinton said, and he was off, telling the story of how they had met at Yale and how gobstruck he was by her from the first time he saw her in class, an imposing young woman wearing big glasses and no makeup, with what he called a “strength and   I found magnetic. ” This was the beginning, he said, of a lifetime relationship that endured “through good times and bad, joy and heartbreak. ” The quality of the rhetoric aside, there has never been a speech quite like the one Clinton delivered here in Philadelphia. A husband speaking on behalf of his wife  —   that has been done before. A former president speaking in support of a prospective president also is nothing new. But the combination of the two is unprecedented. A former president who wants to be first man extolling the virtues of a former first lady who wants to be president. Only the Clintons.  [Winners and losers from the second night of the Democratic convention]  “Only the Clintons” applies in so many ways. Only the Clintons have been hanging around together at the top of American politics for a full quarter century. Only the Clintons can excite and then exasperate their fellow Democrats with such dizzying predictability. Only the Clintons (or maybe now Obama) can send the Republicans into paroxysms of rage and the deepest, darkest pools of conspiracy theorizing. Only the Clintons can keep going and going no matter what obstacles others or they themselves throw in their way along their long and winding path.     Here is former president Bill Clinton’s full speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. (The Washington Post)   Her work for the Children’s Defense Fund, their time in Texas for the 1972 McGovern campaign, the first time he met the Rodham family in suburban Chicago, Bears fans all, his efforts to get her to marry him, once, then twice  —   he went through the story of their lives together as though he was talking to friends in a bar, easy and relaxed, a Cliff’s notes sanitized version of a more complicated story, but a love story nonetheless. Thick and thin, joy and sorrow, yes, but no mention of the events that led to his impeachment or any of the other personal misdeeds that tore at their private relationship and endangered their political lives together. The first time, she was not ready. The second time he flattered her more, saying that he knew a lot of young people who were interested in politics but that she was better than any of them at actually doing things. And he finally got her to visit him in Arkansas, where she took a teaching position and started the first legal aid clinic in northwest Arkansas. And how he finally drove her by a little house she had admired in Fayetteville and told her he had bought it at a mortgage of $175 a month. “The third time was the charm,” he said. They were married on Oct. 11, 1975. “I married my best friend,” he said. He hoped it was a decision she would never regret.  [Bill Clinton’s speech at the Democratic convention, annotated]  Clinton and Clinton were   postwar baby boomers when they arrived on the national scene, shaped by the vibrant and rebellious sixties, rising to take power from a generation defined by the Great Depression and World War II. Bill was chowing down on Big Macs. Hillary was experimenting with different color hair bands. Now they are old timers, battered if not beaten by the vicissitudes of time and experience, agents of change transformed into what some consider symbols of the old school. Yet still, despite it all, enjoying one more chance to make history. The Bill Clinton of 2016 is a shadow of his former self, thinned by years of a vegan diet following heart bypass surgery. His speeches for his wife during the 2016 primary campaign seemed subdued, with only occasional moments when he rose to his previous high standards. But aides and friends say that this speech meant more to him than any he had given this year. The personal implications and political roots of this singular speech stretch back through the decades to the fall of 1971, when Bill and Hillary met in New Haven at Yale Law School, where they were both students, and eventually realized they could get places together that they could not reach apart. Four years later, Hillary stunned her friends by leaving the east coast and joining her boyfriend in the hills of northwest Arkansas, where he was running for Congress. For the next 30 years of their inimitable and tumultuous partnership, she subsumed her own political aspirations for the sake of their rise, serving when needed as his most important policy adviser and campaign strategist during their tenures in the Arkansas governor’s mansion and later in the White House.

"Minds Is the Anti-Facebook That Pays You For Your Time. During Mark Zuckerberg's over 10 hours of Congressional testimony last week, lawmakers repeatedly asked how Facebook makes money. The simple answer, which Zuckerberg dodged, is the contributions and online activities of its over two billion users, which allow marketers to target ads with razor precision. In which case, asked representative Paul Tonko (D - New York), ""why doesn't Facebook pay its users for their incredibly valuable data?"" It's a good question, one that alternative social networks like Minds have attempted to answer. The idea isn't entirely new—Minds launched in 2015—but the site and others like it feel especially relevant as people begin to reexamine the bargain Facebook has made with them. It doesn't feel entirely different from Facebook, at least not at first. 'Helping people make money online is such an important focus of ours.' ",0.0
"These are the stocks that have suffered during the Trump Rally. Throw these dogs a bone  —   or rather, a couple of dollars onto their stock price. As the Dow Jones industrial average has hit   and the S&P 500 Index has gained 5. 8 percent, 135 stocks have not enjoyed the Trump Rally. Those stocks  —   which can be called the Dogs of the Trump Rally  —   are down since Nov. 8. Some of the losers, such as those in the health care space, are to be expected, given   Trump’s promise in an interview earlier this month to  . For example, CVS Health has lost 5 percent since the election, and Abbott Laboratories and Biogen are both down roughly 3 percent. But other stocks have no easy explanation. TripAdvisor, for example, is the biggest dog of the Trump Rally, giving up nearly 27 percent of its market cap since Election Day. The company has struggled in recent years as it’s tried to broaden its business beyond earning fees for referring customers to other online booking sites. Although the company gained 5 percent after signing a deal with Expedia on Dec. 20, shares are down 45 percent for the year. The Gap is leading losers among retail names in the S&P 500. Shares have fallen 16 percent, to $22. 58 as of Friday’s close, since Nov. 8. The mall stalwart’s decline outpaces its struggling peers like Michael Kors, which is down 14. 2 percent, and Urban Outfitters, which lost 12. 7 percent over the same period. Also not on the   is Coty, the parent company of   and   beauty brands like O*P*I, Sally Hansen, Wella and Cover Girl. Its shares plunged 15. 5 percent after Trump’s win, to $18. 60. If reports of the “  haircut” are true, customers may have less of a need for the company’s hair straighteners and other beauty products. The Trump Rally also did nothing to lift toymakers this holiday season. Mattel and Hasbro, which each get roughly 30 percent of its annual revenue in the holiday season, are down 8. 3 percent and 5. 1 percent, respectively, since Trump’s win.",1.0

"Transgender ‘Love & Hip Hop’ star speaks out. D. Smith is one of the most     in the music industry, and has worked with heavyweights including Gwen Stefani, Lil Wayne and Ciara. The   Grammy Award winner is also the first transgender person to ever appear on VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop Atlanta”  —   and says she’s proud of the distinction. “I realized that the more trans people who are in the light will create awareness for trans people,” says the   Smith, who grew up in Brooklyn. “We are all just trying to live, and it’s great to have this platform, so I’m very happy to be on the show. ” Smith’s journey to success, however, was not easy. She’s overcome many hardships in her life, including homelessness and the pressures of living in a religious family  —   and knowing, from an early age, that something about her was different. “Growing up in a black family which was very conservative, you have to abide by the rules  —   and the rules were you are not going to be a ‘trans’ anything,” she says. “I knew [something was different] when I was 7 years old, which was the first time I kissed a guy. But reality set in, so I had to suppress it. I even went as far as dating girls, which were some of the worst times of my life because it was complete dysphoria. I was totally insecure; I didn’t know how to walk, hold [a girl’s] hand or hug her when she was upset. ”   A post shared by D. Smith (@truedsmith) on  Even though Smith is now happy in her own skin, she says she does have some regrets. “At the end of the day, I was manipulating people into thinking that I was happy and [that] I was this straight person who was turned on by them. And it was all a lie,” she says. “I am ashamed that that person was not strong enough to just say, ‘I am going to live my life.’ The only way I was going to be successful is to let my light shine. ” This August will mark the   point in Smith’s transitioning into a woman  —   and she says it’s an ongoing situation. “Transitioning never ends. I will be transitioning until I die,” she says. “People have different goals in their transitioning, so I think that I’m still on my journey and I am grateful that I started. ” There has been some criticism of Smith from her “Love & Hip Hop Atlanta” cast mates   and   Flame. But Smith says she’s not letting the rappers’ words affect her. “Their opinions do not hurt my feelings,” she says. “My problem is that there are little elementary school girls who have friends or peers that may hear [the criticism] and go over the edge, commit suicide or get beat up that day,” she says. “If you do not have anything positive to say, it would help not to say anything. We’re fighting a real fight, both spiritual and physically. I want [Lil Scrappy and  ] to be a little more conscious with their words because they do have a platform. “This is one of the reasons I chose to do ‘Love and Hip Hop Atlanta.’ This is the demographic that people need to see the most,” she says. “Fifteen years from now, some trans girl is going to have it so much easier than I did because I helped out. ”",1.0

"The road to single-payer health care.     (for Obamacare) is not quite dead. It has been declared so, but what that means is that, for now, the president has (apparently) washed his hands of it and the House Republicans appear unable to reconcile their differences. Neither condition need be permanent. There are ideological differences among the various GOP factions, but what’s overlooked is the role that procedure played in producing the deadlock. And procedure can easily be changed. House leadership crafted a bill that would meet the delicate requirements of “reconciliation” in order to create a (more achievable) threshold of 51 rather than 60 votes in the Senate. But this meant that some of the more attractive,   reforms had to be left out, relegated to a future measure (a     bill) that might never actually arrive.  Yet the more   proposal died anyway. So why not go for the gold next time? Pass a bill that incorporates   reforms and send it on to the Senate. September might be the time for resurrecting   . That’s when insurers recalibrate premiums for the coming year, precipitating our annual bout of Obamacare sticker shock. By then, even more insurers will be dropping out of the exchanges, further reducing choice and service. These should help dissipate the preemptive nostalgia for Obamacare that emerged during the current debate. At which point, House leadership should present a    that includes such   provisions as tort reform and permitting the buying of insurance across state lines, both of which would significantly lower costs. Even more significant would be stripping out the   Obamacare coverage mandate that dictates what specific medical benefits must be included in every insurance policy in the country, regardless of the purchaser’s desires or needs. Best to mandate nothing. Let the customer decide. A    couple doesn’t need maternity coverage. Why should they be forced to pay for it? And I don’t know about you, but I don’t need lactation services.  This would satisfy the House Freedom Caucus’ correct insistence on dismantling Obamacare’s stifling regulatory straitjacket  —   without scaring off moderates who should understand that no one is being denied “essential health benefits. ” Rather, no one is being required to buy what the Jonathan Grubers of the world have decided everyone must have.  It is true that even if this revised    passes the House, it might die by filibuster in the Senate. In which case, let the Senate Democrats explain themselves and suffer the consequences. Perhaps, however, such a bill might engender debate and revision  —   and come back to the House for an     conference and a possible compromise. This in and of itself would constitute major progress.  That’s procedure. It’s fixable. But there is an ideological consideration that could ultimately determine the fate of any Obamacare replacement. Obamacare may turn out to be unworkable, indeed doomed, but it is having a profound effect on the zeitgeist: It is universalizing the idea of universal coverage. Acceptance of its major premise  —   that no one be denied health care  —   is more widespread than ever. Even House Speaker Paul Ryan avers that “our goal is to give every American access to quality, affordable health care,” making universality an essential premise of his own reform. And look at how sensitive and defensive Republicans have been about the possibility of people losing coverage in any Obamacare repeal.  A broad national consensus is developing that health care is indeed a right. This is historically new. And it carries immense implications for the future. It suggests that we may be heading inexorably to a     system. It’s what Barack Obama once admitted he would have preferred but didn’t think the country was ready for. It may be ready now. As Obamacare continues to unravel, it won’t take much for Democrats to abandon that Rube Goldberg wreckage and go for the simplicity and the universality of   . Republicans will have one last chance to try to persuade the country to remain with a   system, preferably one encompassing all the provisions that, for procedural reasons, had been left out of their latest proposal. Don’t be surprised, however, if, in the end,   wins out. Indeed, I wouldn’t be terribly surprised if Donald Trump, reading the zeitgeist, pulls the greatest 180 since Disraeli “dished the Whigs” in 1867 (by radically expanding the franchise) and joins the   side.

"DOJ is probing Barclays over whistleblower scandal. The Justice Department is investigating UK banking giant Barclays and the US Postal Service over an alleged attempt to unmask a whistleblower, The Post has learned. Barclays, at the request of Chief Executive Jes Staley, reached out to postal inspectors after its board received two letters mailed from an anonymous employee complaining about the hiring of a   executive, according to a source familiar with the probe. Justice Department investigators are trying to determine whether officials at Barclays or USPS inspectors may have violated civil   whistleblower protections or even criminal law by attempting to unmask the employee, according to the source. It’s not yet clear if the USPS acted on the bank’s request. Barclays said it never learned the identity of the whistleblower. While the civil protections of   are clear, one expert in whistleblower cases said the repercussions could be more severe. It’s possible that anyone in the US government who aided the bank in unmasking the whistleblower could face criminal charges, according to Jordan Thomas, chair of the whistleblower committee at New York law firm Labaton Sucharow. “Under what circumstances do government agencies work for corporations?” Thomas asked. Justice Department investigators are joining the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and New York’s Department of Financial Services to investigate the bank, and are investigating whether a US government employee had violated Section 922 of   by helping Barclays unmask the whistleblower, sources said. Spokespeople for the DOJ and the USPS didn’t return requests for comment. Kerrie Cohen, a Barclays spokeswoman, declined comment. The bank announced Monday that Staley had asked the bank’s internal security team in June to find out who sent two letters to the board that were critical of the hiring of Tim Main to run Barclays’ financial institutions group, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The anonymous letters had raised issues about “Staley’s knowledge of and role in dealing with” personal issues at Main’s previous employer, “and the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays,” the bank said. Main had previously worked for New York investment bank Evercore. Staley’s request in July for the bank’s security team to try to learn the ID of the letter writer was his second attempt to unmask the whistleblower. The CEO had asked first in June  —   but was rebuffed. Those internal security personnel reached out to officials at the USPS in order to track where the letters had originated, the source said. It’s not clear whom the Barclays security personnel reached out to. The USPS’ Inspection Service bills itself as “America’s oldest federal law enforcement agency. ”   mandates that whistleblowers’ anonymity be protected. There is a similar civil protection in the UK. The bank said the “author of the letter was not identified. ” Staley, who’s had the top position at Barclays since 2015, had told his board earlier this year that he thought it was legal to unmask a whistleblower. “I am personally very disappointed and apologetic that this situation has occurred, particularly as we strive to operate to the highest possible ethical standards,” the bank’s chairman, John McFarlane, said in a statement. The bank made a “very significant” change to how much Staley was going to get for his bonus this year, the bank said in a statement. “I have apologized to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part,” said Staley, a former JPMorgan banker. The bank said that, despite Staley’s behavior, they support him staying on as CEO. “Unfortunately, you regularly see leaders within corporate America wanting to hunt down whistleblowers within their organization,” according to Thomas.",1.0

Pentagon investigation into Flynn; French election hacking; NAFTA renegotiations.   . ..And now the Pentagon is investigating Michael Flynn             Earlier this week, the House Oversight Committee announced that Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn might have broken federal law by failing to disclose payments from Russian entities in White House paperwork. [CNN   Tom LoBianco, Manu Raju]  Now he’s under investigation by the Pentagon. The two causes for concern: the payment he received from Russia’s RT TV in 2015 for a speech, and belatedly filing paperwork declaring himself a “foreign agent” (due to his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests here in the US). [New York Times   Emmarie Huetteman]  The crux of the issue, from the Pentagon’s perspective, is that Flynn is a retired officer of the military  —   and as such, he was required to obtain approval from the Pentagon to accept money from foreign groups. Because he could hypothetically be recalled to the military at any time, he is subject to the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars top officials from getting money or favors from foreign governments. [Washington Post   Dan Lamothe, Ed O’Keefe, Sean Sullivan]  (As it turns out, the Defense Intelligence Agency actually warned Flynn about this in 2014, as he was retiring.) [CNN   Manu Raju, Jim Sciutto, Tom LoBianco]  Flynn’s lawyer maintains that Flynn did brief the DIA “extensively” about his RT speech in particular. But in a letter released today, the DIA indicated that it found no records “referring or relating” to Flynn receiving payment from a foreign source. [Politico   Austin Wright]  It might feel like Flynn’s got about 99   legal problems at this point. Not quite. He has committed a lot of shady conduct (some of which involved lying to the vice president) but legally speaking, Vox’s Zack Beauchamp identifies four issues related to Russia and Turkey combined: the possibility that Flynn lied about his status as a foreign agent; that he took office while being a foreign agent; that he lied on his security clearance paperwork in January 2016; and that he took foreign money as a retired officer without permission.

A new report from the   cybersecurity firm Trend Micro says that Russian hackers  —   possibly the same group infamous for interfering in the US election  —   are targeting the presidential campaign of centrist Emmanuel Macron as he heads to a runoff with   candidate Marine Le Pen. [Washington Post   Rick Noack]  It’s too early to definitively pin recent cyberattacks against Macron on the Russian group known as (among other aliases) “Pawn Storm” and “Fancy Bear. ” The perpetrator  here could be a mere imitator. But targeting Macron would be consistent with “Pawn Storm’s” methodology: The Trend Micro report, reviewing two years of the group’s attacks, concludes that “the group has become more adept at manipulating events and public opinion through the gathering and controlled release of information. ” [Trend Micro   Feike Hacquebord]  And as Vox’s Zeeshan Aleem writes, “It’s clear that the attacks converge with Russian interests. If Macron were to face damaging leaks the way Hillary Clinton did during the campaign, it would hurt the chances of a candidate who supports the EU and France’s traditional stance toward Russia. ” [Vox   Zeeshan Aleem]  Macron supports European Union sanctions on Russia, while Le Pen wants to leave the EU and develop a better relationship with Moscow. Vladimir Putin, for his part, has been generally warm toward nationalist movements outside his desired “sphere of influence” (especially when they rise up in NATO countries) and particularly friendly toward the far right in France, and toward Le Pen. [Vice   Alec Luhn]  It was during a Le Pen visit to the Kremlin in March, in fact, that Putin assured her, “We do not want to influence events in any way”  —   which was taken at the time as an assurance that Russia wouldn’t meddle in the French campaign. The release of the Trend Micro report makes that assurance, already sketchy, seem downright suspect. [The Guardian   Shaun Walker and Kim Willsher]  In the wake of the report, the Macron campaign has banned both the Russian   news agency Sputnik and RT TV from campaign events; a spokesperson for Macron called them a   “  entity. ” [Reuters   Andrew Osborn, Richard Balmforth]  The Kremlin has denied the hacking allegations, and the    of RT tweeted of Macron’s actions, “So this is how gracelessly freedom of speech ends in a country which prides itself on its freedoms almost more than it prides itself on its Camembert and brie. ” [Guardian   Reuters]  Here’s why this matters: This week, Macron dipped below 60 percent in voting intention polls for the first time since March 17. Le Pen saw a boost from 40 percent to 41 percent. [Independent   Andrew Callus​]  Which is to say that while Macron is still likely to beat Le Pen, the populist underdog’s best hope would be something drastic  —   something like, say, a massive and embarrassing leak of hacked information.   NAFTA lives another day             Early Wednesday, it was leaked that the Trump administration was considering a draft of an order to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in effect since 1994. [New York Times   Mark Landler, Binyamin Appelbaum]  By Wednesday night, however, Trump had been persuaded to attempt to renegotiate the deal instead  —   thanks to calls from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (twice!)  and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. [Reuters   Ayesha Rascoe, David Lawder]  The urgency was real. The Mexican peso plummeted overnight on the mere rumor that Trump might pull out of the agreement. [NPR   Morning Edition]  Trudeau apparently had to explain NAFTA’s importance to Trump. The Canadian Press reports, “The prime minister said he pointed out that a lot of jobs and industries were developed under NAFTA  —   if the deal were cancelled, it would create too much disruption. ” [Huffington Post Canada   The Canadian Press]  Indeed, NPR reports that “NAFTA covers nearly 500 million consumers,” and yet “When NAFTA hit its 20th anniversary in 2014, a number of economists assessed its impact. Most concluded that NAFTA had a relatively small impact on the economy. ” Trump’s rhetoric that NAFTA is the “worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere” seems to be, predictably, totally overblown. [NPR   Marilyn Geewax]  And analyses of NAFTA’s economic impact have been, for the most part, positive. A report from the Wharton School reads, “Supporters of NAFTA estimate that some 14 million jobs rely on trade with Canada and Mexico combined, and the nearly 200, 000   jobs created annually by NAFTA pay an average salary of 15% to 20% more than the jobs that were lost, according to a PIIE study. Furthermore, the study found that only about 15, 000 jobs on net are lost each year due to NAFTA. ” [University of Pennsylvania   Knowledge@Wharton]  A Wilson Center paper found that in the US, roughly 5 million jobs are dependent on trade with Mexico. “This means that one out of every 29 U. S. workers has a job supported by U. S.  trade,” writes the paper’s author, Christopher Wilson. [Wilson Center   Christopher Wilson]  Even the industries that often get pegged as losers in trade deals, like manufacturing, haven’t suffered due to NAFTA, despite decades of predictions and complaints that they have. [Vox   J. Bradford DeLong]  As with any deal, though, there are winners and losers. Mexico is still struggling to grow a middle class  —   and the maquiladoras (factories) that cluster near the US border to make goods for export certainly haven’t helped. [McClatchy   Tim Johnson]  In the US, meanwhile, one analysis estimated that high school dropouts in industries that benefited from   tariffs (like textile manufacturing) saw their wages grow 17 percent less than they would have if NAFTA hadn’t been put in place. (Of course, it’s always hard to speculate about counterfactuals.) [UVA   John McLaren]  It’s on behalf of workers like those that Trump appears committed to renegotiating NAFTA. Today he said withdrawing “would be a pretty big shock to the system. ” But he also said, “If I’m unable to make a fair deal . .. for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we’re going to give renegotiation a good strong show. ” [Reuters   Ayesha Rascoe, David Lawder]  In Mexico, too, there’s pressure to reconsider NAFTA  —   in the hopes of improving what’s seen as a deal that’s too favorable to the United States. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray actually threatened to withdraw from NAFTA on Tuesday, a day before Trump did (though no one noticed)  —   although Videgaray doesn’t seem committed to seeing that threat through, and stresses that his country won’t accept “just any” renegotiation.

"Is Apple finally going to fix the train wreck that is iTunes?. WWDC is Apple’s conference where, traditionally, the company shows off upcoming software changes. If there’s one piece of Apple software in dire need of some TLC, it’s iTunes, and a new report indicates it might finally get fixed. Serial Apple leaker Mark Gurman   about a new release of iTunes, due to be showcased at WWDC, and released fully later this year. Nothing about this would be surprising. iTunes has been widely regarded as a dumpster fire of a program for years, equal parts unintuitive and buggy. But it’s also the desktop flagship for Apple’s highly lucrative content enterprise, so it has to stick around. One area where iTunes really shows its age is as a management program for iDevices. Using iTunes as the desktop software for devices made lots of sense when it was all iPods, but the use case is totally different these days. No one syncs a full music library from desktop to mobile these days  —   heck, with Spotify and Apple Music, fewer people are syncing music than ever. So what, specifically, should you expect to see from a redesigned iTunes? If I had to guess, I’d say a redesigned interface that breaks down the barriers even further between Apple Music and regular iTunes. The Music app on iOS already blurs the line pretty hard between Apple Music and your own library, and there’s no reason for Apple to not do the same on desktop. The mention that new iTunes will roll out alongside a new Apple Music app also gives me hope that we might finally see a real   music player from Apple. My favorite thing about Spotify isn’t the music library  —   it’s that everything is seamlessly synced across all my devices, and I can control playback on my TV, stereo, desktop or laptop all using my smartphone. Fingers crossed, a new Music app and iTunes could do the same thing for Apple’s ecosystem.",1.0
"The specifics of how Congress “investigates” Russian hacking will make a huge difference.  Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill agree on something: The Russian government’s interference in the presidential election needs an investigation.     The agreement ends there.  The parties are pushing very different approaches for how to investigate. Democrats are calling for the most aggressive option  —   a special bipartisan committee somewhat similar to the   commission that would act independent of the normal course of congressional business and give them subpoena powers they’d otherwise lack. Sen. Mitch McConnell and other Republicans think that goes too far. Instead, they want to go a standard route, deferring investigations to existing committees. The process here matters. The commission would be tasked solely to investigate one issue and likely release a public report at the end.   committees operate with other issues at play, politics and policy included. The extent they’ll investigate Russian interference and release its findings is more of an open question.  The early jockeying foreshadows the kind of relationship congressional Republicans plan to have with the new Trump administration. To liberals, the possibility of Russian meddling looks like an obviously important issue demanding the maximum bipartisan response. McConnell’s weaker push suggests he’s not in the market to as aggressively take on Donald Trump, who has dismissed the questions of Russian interference as a partisan attempt to delegitimize his presidency and made unusually public attacks on the CIA.     The multiple investigations taking shape into Russian meddling Democrats want to move fast, hoping to grab the momentum.     “There’s a fear that if we don’t do anything now, this will become permissive and normalized  —   and we would be willingly watching our democracy really evaporate,” Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell said in an interview. He’s introduced a bill that would commission a panel of 12 investigators, six from each party, exclusively devoted to getting to the bottom of what exactly occurred. “That’s why I’m urging people to act now  —   because the concrete has been poured, and once it’s hardened there’s no going back. ”    All of these investigations will deal with similar evidence, involve the same federal agencies, and cover a lot of the same ground. But it’s crucial to distinguish between which investigation is being discussed, because they’ll each correspond with different investigators and different goals, means, and powers. “There are three big questions that need to be asked: One, who was responsible for the hacking (of the Democratic National Committee)? Two, was the party responsible doing so because they had a preferred candidate? And, three, was the party working with that preferred candidate’s campaign?” Swalwell says.   The administration’s own investigation. On Friday, President Barack Obama’s administration ordered the federal intelligence agencies to conduct a “full review” of Russian meddling and release it to a “range of stakeholders,” including Congress, before Trump’s inauguration. This is the presidential investigation, and Obama has ordered it to conclude before he leaves office.  It’s unclear the extent to which the president will make its results public, but it won’t entail the   committee hearings that could put witnesses under the spotlight. “The presidential inquiry will probably be done quietly, and then some report will be issued that may or may not get a ton of attention,” says Eric Schickler, a political scientist at Berkeley. “Whereas in a congressional investigation, they can force people to testify in front of cameras and publicize what’s going on in this case. It can be a much more powerful tool. ”      How Republicans want to approach the issue: part of regular Senate work, and behind closed doors. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John McCain got behind a congressional investigation spearheaded through existing Senate committees. (McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan have also backed the committees as the right vehicle for exploring the Russian interference question.) That effort would be spearheaded by the Senate Intelligence Committee or the Armed Services Committee, or some combination of the two. One fear for Democrats here is that this will allow the investigation to get bogged down in other committee work. Traditionally, investigative work done through the existing committee structures are also less likely to be disclosed.  But Democrats want a big, bipartisan committee dedicated only to this. In the House, Swalwell wants to probe Russia’s role in election interference through the formation of a new bipartisan “select committee” that would be formed with the entire purpose of investigating Russia’s role in the election and release an extensive report of its findings within 18 months. Similarly, three Democratic senators are calling for a similarly independent committee composed of experts that would have subpoena powers and produce a public report.   The Senate proposal is explicit that the members of the committee would not be members of Congress, but instead outside independent investigators chosen by leadership of both parties. That would make it more like the   commission (which was composed of nonpartisan officials) than the Benghazi committees, which were led by congressional Republicans. Meanwhile, the House proposal only specifies that the members of the commission be chosen by the leadership of both parties. Still, for now at least, these also looks like the least likely to come to fruition. The debate over what kind of committee should investigate Russian interference McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan have so far rejected the calls for a bipartisan select committee. They’ve instead said that the already existing Senate committees are equipped to probe Russia’s role in   hacking. At a press conference yesterday, for instance, McConnell said the Senate Intelligence Committee “is more than capable of conducting a complete review of this matter. ” The objection to an open, bipartisan investigation might be frustrating to those who saw how a select committee was formed to investigate Benghazi, but it’s not particularly surprising. Over the past several decades, there’s been a growing trend of congressional oversight of presidential administrations to be riven almost entirely along partisan lines. That suggests there will be little appetite for congressional Republicans to probe their   over this matter. “If Republicans want to investigate their own president, there’s very little precedent for that,” says Michele Swers, a Georgetown political scientist who specializes in studying Congress. “What’s happening here is what’s known as ‘fire alarm oversight’  —   and in the past that’s been very political. ”    Moreover, it’s not as if Republicans have no response here. The Senate Armed Services Committee may be controlled by the GOP, but it is chaired by Sen. John McCain, who is as hawkish as they come on Russia and foreign policy. Even incoming Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has publicly backed McCain and said the committee is   to investigate the scandal. A Schumer spokesperson says in an email that he hasn’t expressed a preference for a select committee, suggesting a potential divide between House and Senate Democratic leadership over whether a select committee is necessary. “It’s a very good committee and works in a bipartisan way,” Schumer said on Meet the Press. “It should be bipartisan and John McCain leading it. I have a lot of faith in him. ” Such an investigation would have broad powers, but also significant limitations. The Senate investigations would have subpoena power, the ability to force witnesses to testify in public, and could release lengthy public reports that may finger Russia’s role in the election and embarrass Trump. Crucially, however, those powers would be held exclusively by Republicans; Democrats would have no ability to issue subpoenas of their own or decide on which witnesses to compel to testify. For now, Republicans are maintaining that establishing a separate select committee would merely be duplicative  —   and “do not see any benefit in opening further investigations,” as House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes said in a statement. Why Democrats want a select committee investigation Still, many Democrats think the Republicans are giving Trump cover by refusing to back the select committee investigation. The biggest reason why is simply time and resources  —   Swalwell’s bill calls for a full staff of 12 people who would make the investigation their priority, whereas the Senate committee members would simply be investigating in addition to their other responsibilities. (The Democrats’ bill in the Senate  —   sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Patrick Leahy  —   similarly frees up staff to focus exclusively on this investigation.) “This is an important enough committee to solely focus on this one issue,” says Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in an interview. “If it’s just led by the Armed Services Committee, they have a lot of other things going on  —   the day to day where they’ll be dealing with Syria and Aleppo and Turkey. [The select committee] would move it out of that atmosphere. ”    Another part of what happens here is that once members of Congress are designated to focus on the issue, they become invested in the project in a way a committee simply isn’t.  Moreover, it’s not clear that the current Senate committees are particularly interested in freeing up resources to make their work possible. (Senate Intelligence Chair Richard Burr told Politico in a statement that he is not “launching any kind of new   probe” and his own committee remains “concerned about Russia’s actions. ”) Is partisan fighting inevitable here? Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have also voiced the fear that a committee investigation led by a Republicans will not have the credibility with the public that one written by a bipartisan team might.  There’s certainly a degree of   at work here  —   if a report shows that Russia helped Trump win, Democrats will almost certainly use it to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. Being able to cite a report signed off on by members of both parties will give them cover to turn it into a cudgel against the  . Democrats also worry, with some justification, that a committee report from a   panel might never be made public or could be released with key findings redacted.  Those bad feelings come from their experience with the   investigation into the CIA’s torture program, which was conducted by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein, then the head of the panel, wanted to make public the entire   report, which found that the CIA’s use of torture hadn’t produced any major intelligence coups and was far more brutal than previously known.    Sen. Richard Burr, then the ranking member of the committee, pushed to keep the entire report private; ultimately just 528 pages were released in 2014. Breaking with tradition on the normally nonpartisan panel, Burr and his fellow Republicans refused to sign off on the report’s findings, deriding it as a partisan exercise that could harm US national security by sparking renewed   feelings in Muslim and Arab countries.  “Top Republicans described the report as a politically charged Democratic document that distorted events, contending that the intelligence obtained through the harsh tactics had helped in the disruption of terrorism plots and in the search for Osama bin Laden,” wrote the New York Times at the time. “Ms. Feinstein believed the compromise was worthwhile if it meant being able to release the report before the Republicans took control of Congress. ” A select committee appointed along bipartisan lines could help erase that fear. There’s no guarantee that the select committee would be weighted equally between the parties, as Swalwell’s bill calls for  —   the Benghazi select committee, for instance, had more Republicans than Democrats and broke along partisan lines when it came time to issue its findings. Traditionally, though, independent panels like the   commission give both Democrats and Republicans the same numbers of members and allow both sides to issue subpoenas and call witnesses.  But Democrats say it’s worth trying. “Any talk of elections or partisan outcomes will take away the impact of what the investigation may come up with,” Ryan says. “I think it’s important that we not come to any conclusion saying this cost the election to the Democrats or any of that  —   that puts it into the political realm. Which is exactly where this needs not to be. ” ",-1.0
"Trump wants a “massive” tax cut. Here’s his best shot at getting it..  On Wednesday, President Trump will unveil a new set of principles for what he calls “massive” tax cuts for businesses and individuals  —   a plan bigger “than any tax cut ever. ”    Those massive cuts will come with a massive problem for Trump’s economic team: how to pay for them. The White House doesn’t appear to have settled on a means of making up the trillions of dollars in lost federal revenue that economists predict will accompany   cuts. But administration officials are signaling they may be leaning away from hard choices to finance the cuts, and toward highly optimistic assumptions about economic growth. Trump’s last tax reform plan, which he unveiled in September, involved slashing taxes on corporations, individuals, and   businesses. That plan would have created a hole of $4. 4 trillion to $5. 9 trillion in the budget over the next 10 years, even by conservative estimates. On Monday, Trump signaled that cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent is his top priority, according to the Wall Street Journal  —   a move that by itself could cost the government $1. 9 trillion. Calculating the cost of tax cuts will be crucial to the success of tax reform. The easiest route for Republicans, politically, is to get a bill passed through budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority in the Senate. But the legislation would have to be   and not add to the deficit after 10 years.     To make the tax credits pay for themselves, Congress would need to offset the tax cuts by cutting spending in another area of government, or by eliminating some current tax breaks, such as the deduction for mortgage interest payments, or by raising taxes elsewhere in the economy, such as House Republicans have proposed with their border adjustment provision that would effectively tax imports.    But Trump hasn’t been enthusiastic about the border adjustment, and he doesn’t appear inclined to ax popular tax breaks, such as those for homeowners or real estate developers. His budget blueprint cuts domestic spending, but only to fund increases in military and homeland security spending. Without any of those options at his disposal, his only hope to avoid adding to the deficit is a near doubling of economic growth.     Most economists doubt Trump’s tax cuts will pay for themselves Last Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested that the tax overhaul will essentially pay for itself. The administration “fundamentally believes in dynamic scoring,” Mnuchin said at an event in Washington, DC.  Dynamic scoring is a type of economic model, popular among Republican lawmakers, that assumes tax cuts will be so good for the economy that they will indirectly generate more money for the government. Dynamic scoring models during the campaign, though, still showed Trump’s plan losing money. In order for his campaign plan to pay for itself, the   Tax Foundation calculates, Trump’s cuts would need to add 1. 6 percentage points of growth per year, every year, to the current forecast of 1. 8 percent annual economic growth in the United States. Such growth “is not possible under any likely policy scenario,” says Alan Cole, a Tax Foundation economist.    Here’s where things could get weird. It would be possible for White House economists to design a model to come up with the administration’s desired results  —   to show massive growth effects from Trump’s tax cuts  —   but that could prove a political stretch. “If you do dynamic scoring with a miraculous,    feature, that is very problematic,” says Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. It’s possible to use inflated estimates for reconciliation In theory, lawmakers could whatever estimates they want to evaluate a tax plan, including aggressive White House models. The procedural rules that the Senate would use to pass a tax bill with only 51 votes, avoiding the need for any Democratic support, are complex and usually very strict. But one way they aren’t strict is in calculating the cost estimates that are used to determine whether the bill adheres to those rules. This is the general consensus from experts we consulted: If Congress wanted to swap in estimates from, say, the White House Office of Management and Budget for the ones typically provided by the CBO and that Joint Committee on Taxation, it probably could. Nobody can be 100 percent sure what will be deemed allowable  —   this is relatively uncharted territory. “I don’t think . .. that there is anything that would prevent the Senate Budget Committee from using OMB projections instead of   projections,” Alan Frumin, a former Senate parliamentarian, said in an email. He added this catch: “Other than the institutional embarrassment of a house of Congress snubbing its own budgetary experts in favor of those from a different (and Constitutionally competing) branch of the government. ”    This has come up before. There were conservative rumblings in 2015 that Republicans could use their own estimates to repeal Obamacare under the same Senate rules. Back in the 1990s, the Senate actually did it when they disagreed with the CBO’s assessment of the sale of oil reserves. So the idea isn’t unfathomable. But it would be a big break from the norm. It seems unlikely that Congress would go for this  Economists do believe that some dynamic scoring is legitimate to consider in cost estimates  —   that there will be some sort of broad economic benefit from cutting taxes. The thing is, they don’t believe it’s very much, and certainly not enough to offset trillions of dollars in tax cuts. It’s unlikely that Congress would ever use   White House cost projections for major legislation like tax reform, Marron says. For most of their history, congressional budget committees always choose to use cost projections calculated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. When Republicans took over Congress in 2015, they began requiring economists at the budget office and taxation committee to take into account dynamic scoring on major legislation. So they will probably consider the macroeconomic benefits of tax cuts in upcoming efforts to overhaul the tax code. It’s very unlikely, though, that their estimates of the impact will be as generous as the White House’s. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican and the lead tax writer for the House, recently reemphasized his view that any tax reform proposal should be  .     ”I believe, both the most   approach we can take, and the fiscally responsible approach we can take, is to break even with the budget, counting on just solid, verifiable economic growth,” he said at a Financial Services Roundtable event, according to the Hill newspaper. It’s unclear how much dynamic scoring Brady would consider appropriate. But he has been clear on which scorekeepers he would accept. “Deficits matter,” he told Vox’s Jim Tankersley in a February interview. “And so we designed the tax reform in the House to be   counting on economic growth. Not economic growth judged by us, but by the independent Joint Committee on Taxation. ” We’ll see if Trump agrees.   ",-1.0
"Here’s how incredibly difficult it is for a refugee to get admitted to the US.  President Trump on Saturday justified his executive order suspending the US’s refugee admissions program on national security grounds, calling for a more thorough form of “extreme vetting” to replace the current screening regime in order to better determine whether a refugee poses a danger to the country.     But the reality is that the current vetting system is already pretty extreme: exhaustive, loaded with safeguards, enormously selective, and constantly being improved. It typically takes 18 to 24 months, but it can last as long as three years. It’s difficult to conceive of what kind of extra steps could be added to make it even more extreme. What is clear is that Trump’s approach to reforming the vetting system is extraordinarily harsh. His executive order bans all refugees from entering the US for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. It also more than halved the ceiling for refugees who will be allowed into the US this fiscal year, reducing it from 110, 000 to just 50, 000.  So far, around 30, 000 refugees have been let in this fiscal year (which began in October 2016 for the federal government). But it’s unclear how many more  —   if any  —   will be let in if Trump extends the refugee ban or makes the vetting process selective to the point of being entirely impenetrable.    Trump’s refugee suspension is a solution in search of a problem Trump’s defense of the executive order  —   which includes, most controversially, a   ban preventing foreign nationals from seven   countries from entering the US  —   has been that it’s necessary to protect the country from nefarious foreigners who want to use the refugee program to sneak into the US and launch terrorist attacks.       Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world   a horrible mess! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017    But the current system in place is designed to prevent exactly that, and it has many extra layers of security for refugees from Syria and other countries where groups like ISIS and   are most active.  Mousa Almshhad, a    refugee from Syria who was resettled with his family last year in Baltimore, said that his refugee resettlement process entailed being interviewed four or five times, with about two to two and a half months in between each interview.     “I do not think there’s a single question about my life that they didn’t ask about” “The questions were not just questions  —   they were interrogations that were being back by investigations,” he told me in a phone interview, speaking through a translator because he doesn’t speak English. “They really cared about knowing about all the details. Each question led to another hundred questions. I do not think there’s a single question about my life that they didn’t ask about. ” Almshhad, whose wife and    son were interviewed separately from him, said the interrogations often involved being asked the same questions over and over again, but in different ways, with the goal of   and spotting slight inconsistencies. “I was telling the truth the whole time, so my story was straight, but other people who had slipped up and given different details were rejected on the spot,” he told me.    “I was asked questions you could not believe and could not think of, and even asked questions about my life that I did not know the answers to,” he said. “They even asked about one of my uncles who was dead for a couple of questions. ”             The intense investigation that Almshhad underwent in order to be admitted to the US was not unusual. The arduous vetting process involves investigations by a coordinated network of US law enforcement and intelligence agencies, all actively looking for any indication that an individual could potentially pose a threat in the future.  That level of rigor is partly why not a single refugee has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the United States since the current refugee program was put in place in 1980.  The vetting process has many steps  —   and tons of safeguards  The refugee admission process has evolved over the years in order to try to maximize the effectiveness of the program and ensure that it doesn’t let any potentially risky candidates slip through the cracks. I spoke with Robin Dunn Marcos, the senior director of processing and resettlement at the International Rescue Committee, to help walk me through the vetting procedure.  Step 1: The very beginning of the process usually involves an individual or family seeking refugee status through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the organization that oversees refugee support and protection across the world.  The UNHCR collects some initial biographical information, identifying documents, and sometimes biometric data like fingerprints. Then typically either the UNHCR or a representative from the government of the country the refugee has fled to conducts an   interview to determine if the person does in fact meet the legal definition of a “refugee. ”     According to the UNHCR, a refugee is defined as “someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence. A refugee has a   fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. ” The UNHCR refers less than 1 percent of people who qualify as refugees for resettlement in a third country like the United States. There are currently 26 countries that actively participate in refugee resettlement, and historically the US has been the leader, generally accepting more than half of the world’s refugees referred to a third country. Yet the US is also home to fewer refugees per capita than many other affluent nations. For example, according to 2015    data from the UNHCR, Sweden had 17 refugees per 1, 000 inhabitants, France had 4. 2, the UK had 1. 9  —   and the US had 0. 8. In the past several years, the ceiling set for refugee arrivals in the US has hovered somewhere around 60, 000 to 70, 000 refugees a year, with a spike in 2016 to 85, 000 as part of a bid by the Obama administration to take in more Syrian refugees.  Step 2: After the UNHCR has referred a refugee to the US for potential resettlement, the applicant’s information is sent to a Resettlement Support Center. These are international agencies or nonprofit organizations contracted by the US State Department  —   such as the International Organization for Migration or Church World Services  —   to interview the refugee and compile the personal data and background information needed for US security clearances and interviews.  They also kick off the first security clearance process by checking the refugee’s name against a global database to see if the person had applied for a visa or other immigration benefits before, which, if they had, would be flagged and reviewed. Step 3: After that, the main security check begins  —   a screening process more extensive than for any other kind of person entering the US, such as someone traveling on a student or business visa.     A network of US law enforcement and intelligence agencies including the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and others screen and investigate the applicant using the information from the Resettlement Support Center. They look at things like the refugee’s criminal background, possible connections to groups the US considers a threat, family relations, travel patterns, cellphone records, social media presence, and more. This interagency security investigation continues in the background throughout the rest of the vetting process. If any new information about a refugee emerges, whether through subsequent interviews or because they did something like register a new email address or get a new phone number, it will be end up being scrutinized through the ongoing security screening program.         Step 4: People coming from conflict zones and terrorist hot spots  —   such as Iraq and Syria  —   are then subjected to an extra layer of security checks. The US errs heavily on the side of caution with Syrians; in 2015, the Department of Homeland Security said the US only took in about   of the Syrian applicants referred by the UN.  Step 5: If the applicant clears all of those screenings, a specially trained officer from the Department of Homeland Security travels to the country where the refugee is currently living in order to interview them in person, to make sure both that their claim to being a refugee is valid and that they are admissible under US law  —   making sure they weren’t involved in persecution of others in their home country, providing material support to terrorists, and so on. During this process, fingerprints and photographs are taken as well. Their fingerprints are then   against various biometric databases, including the FBI biometric database; the DHS biometric database, which includes terrorist watch list information; and the Defense Department database, which includes fingerprints that have been obtained around the world.  There’s also a medical screening conducted, to make sure the refugee is fit for travel and to identify any diseases that could affect public health in the US.     Step 6: Next, the refugee is matched up with one of nine domestic sponsoring agencies in the US that work with the State Department to help the refugee settle somewhere in the US. Most (though not all) of these sponsoring agencies are   organizations, and they have about 300 offices across the country in total.  Refugees are provided with a cultural orientation session that lasts a few days and then matched with housing and provided with a modest stipend to help them adjust in their first three months to start their new life in the US. Agencies also help place them in a job, but encourage them to become economically   as swiftly as possible.  All along the way, the resettlement agencies are expected to report any suspicious activity they see to the government  —   for example, if a man abandons his family shortly after arriving in the US. Refugees are also required to report any change of address to DHS within 10 days.  The vetting process is always evolving The refugee vetting process has been internally evaluated and improved over the years in order to identify potential gaps. For example, in 2008 the family reunification program for refugees was suspended after widespread fraud was discovered among refugees from East Africa who claimed they were related because they thought it would boost their odds of selection.  The program was reinstated again in 2012, but with additional safeguards, like DNA testing or a requirement of official adoption papers. Family reunification has gone from being responsible for 15 to 20 percent of refugee arrivals in the 1990s to less than 1 percent today as a result. (There is, however, legitimate concern that the requirement probably poses some insurmountable obstacles for some adoptive families.) “Refugees are the most vetted group of entrance into the United States,” says Dunn Marcos. “It’s easy to take pride in the program because it is continually strengthened. ”     Trump has yet to provide any concrete details about what he means by “extreme vetting. ” So far, it’s just the temporary ban.  But given the measures already in place, it’s far from clear how it could be improved dramatically without resulting in a complete stoppage of any refugees coming in at all. Perhaps that’s the goal.

"Bloomberg wants to save everyone from Trump. But a lot of people don’t know who he is..  Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has instructed his aides to draw up plans for a potential   challenge in this year’spresidential race, the New York Times is reporting. Earlier this month, reports emerged that the former mayor, disgusted bythe continued dominance of Donald Trump in the Republican field, was”mulling a run.”    Bloomberg went so far as to commission a poll to see how he would fare against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the assumed (but not determined) Democratic  . Though no one close to Bloomberg released the results of their poll, a poll released Thursday by Morning Consult answers the question of who would win in a   matchup. Among the 4, 000 people they surveyed across the country, Bloomberg draws just 13 percent of supporters when the other two choices are Trump and Clinton. In that same hypothetical, Trump wins 37 percent of supporters and Clinton wins 36 percent  —   a statistical tie. Fourteen percent of respondents said they had no opinion.    But there’s more bad news in the poll for Bloomberg: Nearly half of the electorate, 43 percent, doesn’t even recognize his name. Though more voters say they hold a positive view of him than a negative one, his low name recognition may hinder the potential candidate from gaining immediate traction. Of course, it could also mean that his support is artificially low in this poll, because more voters might warm to him as they get to know him.    And if Bloomberg intends to curtail Trump’s popularity by throwing himself into the ring, his candidacy wouldn’t have that effect, either. In a   matchup between Trump and Clinton, Clinton beats out Trump 44 to 42 percent. But throw in Bloomberg, and Clinton’s support declines by 8 percentage points; Trump’s only declines by 5. Interestingly, with Bloomberg in the mix, Clinton prevails more decisively in matchups against Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, beating both by at least 4 percentage points, outside the poll’s margin of error.    But even if Bloomberg were to overcome the problems presented in this poll, he may not reach success as a   candidate. As John Fund wrote for the National Review when Bloomberg was first rumored to run, ”The rules and obstacles that stack presidential politics against independent or   candidacies aren’t fair, but they are nonetheless real.” Fund examined the real problem behind a   candidate: the electoral college. He pointed out that even though the most popular   candidate in recent history, Ross Perot, won 19 percent of the national vote, he didn’t win a single electoral vote. So Bloomberg, who seems to have even higher barriers to name recognition, seems even less   to tackle that structural problem. All these factors certainly aren’t encouraging for Bloomberg. ",-1.0

"Jobs report beats expectations with 255K jobs added in July. Exhale, America! The US economy, despite its sluggish spring performance, created 255, 000 jobs in July, well above expectations  —   and May and June results were revised up. In addition, average hourly wages ticked up at a healthy rate and the average number of hours worked in a week rose  —   as did the labor participation rate. The unemployment rate held steady at 4. 9 percent. Still, while the July new jobs number came in well over the forecasted 179, 000, the average monthly gain this year rose to only 186, 000  —   down from the 229, 000 monthly average last year. “This deceleration from last year’s   pace should not be unexpected as the economy has moved closer to full employment,” Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Robert Kaplan said in a speech earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. Highlighting labor market strength, average hourly wages increased a healthy eight cents. May payrolls were revised up to 24, 000 from the previously reported 11, 000 and June’s robust 287, 000 jobs created was revised to 292, 000. Last month’s strong job growth should reinforce the Fed’s confidence in a labor market that officials view as at or near full employment. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100, 000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth. The second straight month of robust job gains is a boost to an economy after growth averaged a 1. 0 percent annual rate in the last three quarters. After a policy meeting last month, the Fed described the labor market as having “strengthened” and said it appeared it was still tightening. The central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady since amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Most economists expect another rate hike in December, though financial markets have almost priced out that possibility. The 0. 3 percent increase in average hourly earnings left the    gain at 2. 6 percent. The payrolls data added to July auto sales in underscoring the economy’s sound fundamentals. Economic growth is expected to accelerate to at least a 2. 5 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. But with the bulk of labor market slack largely absorbed and the economy’s recovery from the   recession showing signs of aging, payroll gains will probably drift to average between 150, 000 and 160, 000 jobs per month later this year, economists say. Manufacturing sector employment increased by 9, 000 jobs in July after adding 15, 000 positions in June. Construction payrolls rose 14, 000 following three consecutive months of declines, while mining shed a further 7, 000 jobs in July. Other details of the employment report showed a rise in the labor force. That raised the participation rate, or the share of   Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, by   of a percentage point to 62. 8 percent.",1.0
"A ""safe zone"" in Syria sounds like a great idea. It would be a disaster..  The goal of a “safe zone” is a laudable one: to protect civilians from attacks in a designated area. But despite its misleadingly simplistic name, establishing a “safe zone” in Syria would put civilians in even greater danger and risk prolonging Syria’s bloody nightmare.    Safe zone proponents and opponents alike can agree that the failure of the international community to end the war in Syria is one of the greatest moral outrages of our time. But in trying to stop the carnage, we owe it to Syrians to not put their lives in even greater jeopardy. Here, then, are the three main reasons so many humanitarian organizations, human rights advocates, and other experts in civilian protection warn that Washington and its allies militarily imposing a safe zone in Syria would harm, not help, civilians: 1) A safe zone would concentrate vulnerable people in one place, making them a perfect target When one combs through interviews from United Nations officials, humanitarian aid workers, human rights advocates, and Syrian refugees regarding their concerns about a safe zone in Syria, one word will continually resurface: Srebrenica.     During the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, the UN proclaimed the town of Srebrenica as one of six “safe areas” where civilians could flee for protection.     For years there were widespread concerns among top policymakers in the United States, France, Britain, and the United Nations that Srebrenica could not be sufficiently protected as a safe area. Some argued that there wouldn’t be enough troops to defend the area, while a UN Security Council report highlighted the potential for Srebrenica to be targeted by the Bosnian Serb army.      Dutch peacekeepers were sent to Srebrenica under a UN mandate to protect civilians, but stood aside while Bosnian Serb forces invaded. In fact, the evening of the invasion, the Dutch commander drank a toast with the Bosnian Serb general.     The next day, the Bosnian Serbs set about massacring 8, 000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys, in the worst atrocity on European soil since World War II. Having thousands of civilians in one place made it easier for the Bosnian Serbs to carry out such a massive genocide.       A safe zone is by design intended to concentrate the number of civilians in one place. If the safety of civilians can truly be guaranteed, then lives can be saved. A crucial lesson from Srebrenica is that if civilians’ safety cannot be guaranteed, concentrating civilians in such an area can make them even more vulnerable to the attacks the safe zone was intended to shield them from.  Establishing and defending a safe area in Syria would face the same challenges. It isn’t hard to imagine ISIS or other groups attempting to seize the international spotlight by attacking a safe zone and murdering thousands of vulnerable civilians.     2) A safe zone would need consent from the warring parties to really be safe    Like the “safe areas” in the Bosnian war, a safe zone in today’s Syria would not have consent from all of the major warring parties. None of the major parties to the conflict  —   including the Assad regime, Russia, Iran, ISIS, and other groups  —   could be expected to recognize any safe area imposed by the United States. In fact, they would almost certainly be expected to violate the rules of the safe area.  As Ariane Rummery, the spokesperson of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) asserts, the lack of consent from the primary warring parties would make it virtually impossible to create a safe zone that is truly safe for civilians: “Without full International Humanitarian Law (IHL) safeguards in place, including consent of the government and warring parties and the zone being civilian in character, safety of civilians would be hard to guarantee. ”  In a letter to European Union leaders earlier this year, Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, criticizes the EU for using the term “safe zone” at all in the Syrian context. He points out that while the Geneva Conventions describe “safety areas” as places that all parties to any conflict respect as neutralized, “no one is remotely suggesting such truly safe places would be established along the Turkish border. ” Proponents of both a safe zone and a   zone often cite the example of the   zone imposed by the US and its allies in northern Iraq in 1991. Leaving aside all the other concerns the humanitarian community has about the Iraqi   zone, it is crucial to note that the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein gave its consent for the   zone.  This is a stark distinction from the Syrian example, in which it is virtually impossible to imagine that the Assad regime would give its consent to such an arrangement, outside of a broader diplomatic settlement.  Also unlike the Iraq example of the 1990s, the Syrian war is made up of a multitude of overlapping global, regional, and local rivalries. To secure a safe zone would require not only the consent of the Assad regime but also the consent of Iran, ISIS, and dozens of other groups fighting in Syria.     Consent would also have to be obtained by the Russian government, which is backing the Assad regime. Russia would likely respond to a safe zone militarily imposed by the United States by escalating its own aerial assaults, in order to assert geopolitical dominance in Syria.  3) Defending the safe zone would widen the war and make a political settlement less likely To impose a safe zone in the absence of a diplomatic agreement, the United States would have to massively escalate its military intervention in Syria. This means Washington waging an   war against the Assad regime and its allies  —   including Russia and Iran.  Enforcing a safe zone implies an   commitment to the use of military force in a designated safe area of Syria to stop air and ground attacks from the Assad regime, Russia, Iran, ISIS, and other extremist groups. Secretary of State John Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year that it would take up to 30, 000 US troops to maintain a safe zone in Syria.  If 30, 000 US troops were deployed to northern Syria and attacks continued from Assad, Russia, Iran, or ISIS, it seems all the more likely that the US response at that point would simply be to send even more troops. Militarily imposing a safe zone, then, would ultimately be a colossal escalation, taking the US further down an already very slippery slope of military intervention. Perhaps of the greatest threat to global security is the threat of the US shooting down a Russian airplane in Syria. Former White House adviser Aaron David Miller astutely asked, “Are we prepared to play chicken with the Russians over Syria’s skies, and would we risk downed pilots falling into ISIS hands? What would we gain?” Furthermore, what would civilians gain from escalating US tensions with Russia? What would they lose?  Perhaps the only areas of Syria made safer  —   not safe but safer  —   for civilians during the course of the civil war have been those areas that experienced a dramatic drop in civilian casualties during the “cessation of hostilities” that held from late February until its collapse in April. In the areas under the partial ceasefire agreement, civilian casualties were at a   low.     Protecting Syrian civilians will depend on negotiating a new ceasefire, and eventually an inclusive political settlement that ends the killing. A militarily imposed safe zone will take us further that from a comprehensive political solution, which is the only way to truly ensure the enduring safety of Syrian civilians.

"‘Greedy Halloween kids’ empty an unattended candy bowl and divide a D.C. neighborhood.      The duo were dubbed the “greedy Halloween kids” in a posting accompanying a security camera video on a neighborhood listserv. In the video, the pair are seen taking a healthy share  —   the whole bowl, in fact  —   of treats from a black cauldron on the front porch of a home on Garrison Street in Northwest Washington. One of the two children can be seen unzipping her backpack and dumping the entire bowl of candy inside. Then a boy with her takes some of the candy from her backpack and puts it into his bag. The children appear to be elementary or middle school students. The video, which appeared to originate from a Tenleytown neighborhood listserv and was   to a Chevy Chase listserv, was posted after Halloween by a homeowner who described how his family put out a bowl of candy so they could take their    daughter   . “Less than an hour later a pair of kids showed up with a large backpack and emptied the entire bowl,” the homeowner wrote. He went on, asking his neighbors, “If you recognize the kids in this video link below, please let them know they are not welcomed on Garrison St. next year. ” The video has since been removed. Attempts to reach the man who posted the video and those in charge of the listserv were unsuccessful, but plenty of neighbors weighed in. One neighbor said the    were “welcome always” and listed her address. Then she wrote, “Perhaps a sign on the candy bowl as to how much to take would have been helpful. ” Another woman questioned where the parents of the two children were at the time of the incident and suggested that “perhaps there is some calamity at home. ” She continued, “Perhaps their parents aren’t involved. ” She also said, “In any case, they did what children do before they are full grown. I would love it if we could go back to erring on the side of kindness towards our brethren, instead of looking righteous in the eyes of our neighbors. ”  Another neighbor on the listserv from Chevy Chase, Md. called it a “sad state of affairs” and said her candy, when left unattended outside the home, had been stolen “multiple years in a row. ” “I truly hope someone recognizes those children,” she wrote. “The size of their ‘candy’ bags alone speaks to their intentions. ” Read more: How do you    at 30, 000 feet?

"‘No Time to Die’ Trailer Predicts James Bond’s Future . Halfway through the first trailer for No Time to Die—the 25th James Bond film, and the last to star Daniel Craig as the lead MI6 agent—007 delivers a warning: “History isn’t kind to men who play god.” Presumably, he’s talking to Safin, the villain played by Rami Malek, but in some ways the Bond franchise has been playing god for decades. Each time one 007 retires, the franchise just reincarnates the agent into a new body. Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, Craig, among others—the list goes on and on. Now that Craig has sworn he’ll never come back for another installment, a new actor eventually will join that list, and the torch will get passed. Judging by this first trailer, that new Bond could be Lashana Lynch (Captain Marvel’s Maria Rambeau). Ever since she was cast, there have been rumors that she might take up the mantle. This trailer doesn’t prove that she's the new 007, just a double-0, but it also hints that she’s the future of the franchise. As soon as her Nomi appears, she warns that “the world’s moved on, Commander Bond” before promising him: “You get in my way and I will put a bullet in your knee … the one that works.” That’s quite the introduction, literally threatening to kneecap the old guard if it gets in her way. But sometimes that’s just how it is. This Bond film, directed by Beasts of No Nation’s Cary Joji Fukunaga, is the end of an era, but also the beginning of a new one. In addition to Bond 25 being Craig’s last, it’s also the first since #MeToo and Time’s Up. It’s cowritten by Fleabag and Killing Eve creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose involvement made Lynch squeal with excitement. “I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, British girl just like me,’” she told The Hollywood Reporter recently. “‘She’s going to know how to actually take care of women onscreen.’” Bond fans will see if she’s right when No Time to Die hits theaters April 10, 2020.",0.0

"It’s time to junk 401(k)s and IRAs and have Social Security finance our whole retirements.  As markets go, the market for retirement savings is pretty awful. In a good world, there just wouldn’t be much money to be made on helping people sock money away in 401( k)s and IRAs. The only retirement investment advice anyone really needs fits on a     index card:                The basics are really simple. Save 15 to 25 percent of your income (use this calculator to get an estimate for your specific situation); take advantage of   savings like 401( k)s and Roth IRAs; buy   index funds rather than picking stocks yourself or hiring an active fund manager to do it for you. If you’re really rich, things can get more involved, but for most people it’s not that complicated. But handing out free index cards is not a lucrative business, so brokers have to figure out other ways to make money. Traditionally, one of those methods has been receiving kickbacks from mutual funds and other investment vehicles for convincing clients to invest. It’s a practice that the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates costs savers about $8 billion to $17 billion a year by directing people to buy less profitable assets. Luckily, the Labor Department has finalized a rule that will crack down on that specific practice. But there are still millions of people picking and choosing stocks rather than just investing in index funds, and millions more who aren’t saving enough, mostly because their   expenses in rent, health care, food, college tuition, etc. are so daunting.    So here’s an idea. Instead of trying to repair our broken privatized retirement system, why not give the public sector a shot? Why not expand Social Security so that it functions not just as a backstop but as the primary source of retirement income for ordinary Americans?    Two shortcomings of Social Security            Social Security is a wonderful, wonderful program. It is the single most important   program in the United States, apart from its primary social insurance functions, and it has a longevity and place in American culture that few other government institutions can match. And not for nothing, it’s ridiculously popular. The issue is that we need more of it. There are currently two big problems with retirement in America. The first is that there’s still such a thing as senior poverty. The supplemental poverty measure (SPM) the census’s superior metric for this kind of thing, puts the rate at 14. 4 percent. But without Social Security, it would be 50 percent.    This tells us a couple of things. One is that Social Security is an enormously effective tool for keeping seniors out of poverty. Another is that there are still 6. 6 million seniors who aren’t getting enough from the program, or from Supplemental Security Income (which keeps only 1. 2 percent of seniors out of poverty). The way to fix this is simple: Guarantee every American over 65 (or 67, or whatever) a basic income. Make each senior person’s Social Security benefit the greater of a) their benefit per the Social Security formula, or b) the SPM poverty threshold. That would definitionally end senior poverty in America. This idea has gotten some play in Washington circles. On the right, American Enterprise Institute’s Andrew Biggs has proposed replacing Social Security with a basic income set at the poverty line, plus an automatic savings program. On the left, Michael Lind, Steven Hill, Robert Hiltonsmith, and Joshua Freedman released a plan through New America that would add on a basic income set at about the poverty line (the specific number is $11, 669) to existing Social Security. The latter proposal has a shortcoming in that only retirees with earnings get the benefit, but it’s simple enough to expand.    The second problem is that many   Americans don’t get adequate income from their work, savings, and Social Security. This is an area of considerable dispute among researchers, but the most optimistic assessments suggest that 28 percent of new retirees don’t have enough wealth to maintain their standard of living, a percentage that’s steadily growing. Another assessment found that 52 percent of households in 2013 were 10 percent below their target retirement savings rate. As of 2013, the typical American household headed by someone between 55 and 64 had only $14, 500 in retirement savings; excluding those who’d saved nothing, the median was $104, 000, or only enough for a $   annuity:             A pretty small minority of families headed by someone 65 or older even take out distributions from retirement savings  —   only 19 percent in 2009, and only 8 percent of the poorest families. Only 6 percent of black families 65 and older took out retirement money that year. Relying on asset income in retirement is the exception, not the norm. So what if instead of relying on this patchwork system  —   Social Security as base, the   defined benefit pension system for a few, risky and   401( k) for everyone else (assuming they’re rich enough to have jobs that offer retirement benefits)  —   we designed Social Security so that it could replace all of that? Currently the program replaces 90 percent of your earnings up to $10, 272 a year, 32 percent of your earnings between that and $61, 884 a year, and 15 percent of earning from there to the $   cap. What if the formula were instead that you received the greater of:  The poverty line, or 80 percent of average earnings, up to $61, 884 a year  This wouldn’t just eliminate senior poverty; it would also eliminate the need to save for retirement for the roughly   of people with average earnings under that amount. It would substantially reduce the need to save for people making above that. It would obviously require a   increase in the payroll tax, getting rid of the income cap, increasing the rate for both employers and employees, and maybe subjecting some investment income to payroll tax (as already happens for Medicare).    But for workers already saving for retirement, that payroll tax increase would be offset, ideally more than offset, by reduced    savings. For workers not saving for retirement, it would lead to less   pay during their working years, but it would function as a forced retirement plan and ensure them a decent living after age 65. If they should’ve been socking away 15 to 25 percent anyway, it should make no difference if that’s encouraged to happen through savings or through Social Security. You could also eliminate tax breaks for 401( k)s and IRAs, which would at this point serve entirely as giveaways to the rich. And if the tax increases are progressive (by lifting the cap or subjecting investment income to more taxation or eliminating savings tax breaks) then the likely payroll tax increase for   and   workers should be easily less than what they would’ve needed to save on their own. This goes way beyond the expansion proposals of people like Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, and Elizabeth Warren. Sanders, for example, does an    benefit increase, using a   inflation measure for    adjustments, and guarantees a   benefit to everyone who’s worked at least 26 years. That’s a great start  —   but he could go even further. Would giant Social Security destroy America’s savings?             The big concern with a plan like this is that it would crowd out private savings, hurting the economy. Fewer people saving for retirement means less demand for stocks and bonds, which makes it harder for corporations to finance themselves, hurting economic growth. It’s unclear if this is an actual problem in the United States at the present moment. Interest rates have been very low for a while, which might be a function of monetary policy but could also reflect a fundamental excess of demand for investments, which would drive down their price and lower their returns. You could see the case for responding to this by discouraging personal savings by Americans, perhaps by massively expanding Social Security. Even if you don’t buy that argument, it’s worth questioning how much savings this would crowd out. The rich save vastly more for retirement than the poor, millions of whom don’t have any savings at all at the moment; they wouldn’t be crowded out, they’d just be benefited, greatly. Moreover, rich households probably aren’t going to settle for a maximum retirement payout of around $50, 000 a year. They’ll still need some retirement savings.    But let’s say we run the numbers and this idea still depresses private savings by an unacceptable amount. There’s an easy solution: Establish a Social Security sovereign wealth fund! Currently the program invests entirely in US government treasuries. Those are very safe assets, but investing in them doesn’t do anything to benefit the private sector. So some Social Security analysts, like Boston College’s Alicia Munnell, have long called for the program to diversify its assets and invest in equities as well. Canada’s pension system already invests in a wide variety of assets  —   it owns Neiman Marcus, for example  —   and Singapore has a somewhat related system in which people are forced to save in a big   fund. Sovereign wealth funds in general are a pretty widespread practice; China has one to manage its pension system, as well as another to manage exchange rates and two more in Hong Kong, and   countries like Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Norway all have them as well. The US even has one already: the Alaska Permanent Fund, which uses revenue from natural resources to pay out a dividend ($2, 000 last year, but usually lower) to every man, woman, and child in the state. A sovereign wealth fund wouldn’t just solve the savings problem for expanded Social Security; it would provide a way to direct investments toward underfunded projects, like infrastructure development. ”It could be through this fund that we bring capital to underserved communities,” NYU professor Dalton Conley, a vocal sovereign wealth fund advocate, writes. ”Or it could be the basis of an investment agenda in green technologies.” So the real reason to oppose massively expanded Social Security isn’t concern over private savings; it’s that you fundamentally don’t think the government should have this level of control over investments. That’s a reasonable enough position, but given the persistence of senior poverty and the continued inadequacy of 401( k)s, we could do worse than expanding the most successful retirement program in America.

"Republicans’ many tortured excuses for not going to their Donald Trump-led convention.        It’s no secret that the Republican Party is split right now; while millions and millions of Republicans voted for the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, the party leadership is still wary of hitching its wagon to him, for fear of the consequences in 2016 and beyond. Some of them struggled to endorse Trump, coming up with halfhearted praise and a collective ”meh.” And now a whole group of party elites won’t attend this month’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland, thinking that it would devolve into some kind of   circus. Of course, that’s not their stated reason for skipping out. No, they have a variety of excuses: They’re too busy running their own campaigns, they’d rather watch on television, or they have previous engagements scheduled (like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who apparently has to mow his lawn for the entire   political extravaganza). Some didn’t even bother with an excuse, like Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. Neither of the living Republican former presidents  —   George W. Bush, nor his father, George H. W. Bush  —   will attend. And Jeb Bush, who was once thought to be the 2016   certainly won’t be asking any of his supporters to ”please clap” for Trump. The 2012 Republican nominee (that was just four years ago!) won’t even attend the convention.

"One final election plea, on the behalf of U.S. ideals.    Sixteen years ago I awaited the arrival of Election Day, anxious but hopeful. I was a part of a presidential campaign that had challenged the stereotype of Republicanism with a series of policy proposals on education, addiction treatment and other elements of social welfare. Suspend, for a moment, your views on the efficacy of No Child Left Behind and the   initiative. Accept that we viewed the coming election  —   if we won  —   as the mandate for a certain model of governance.  I was deeply and personally invested in the outcome of the 2000 election. I believed that the reform of Republican ideology would serve the whole country, the common good. When I walked into the West Wing for the first time, and entered the Roosevelt Room just as the picture above the fireplace was being switched from Franklin to Teddy, I felt the continuity and burden of a noble experiment in  .  In his first inaugural address (a document I helped produce) President George W. Bush expressed the goal of his administration this way: “Sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country. We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. ”   We were not, of course, unique in this idealism. This was the commitment of Barack Obama’s administration when it entered the White House. And Bill Clinton’s administration. And nearly all that preceded them.          I own up to being even more emotionally entangled in the result of the 2016 election  —   not because of any change in policy or ideology, but because of Donald Trump’s proposed shift in the very purpose of the presidency. His political theory, such as it is, is “us” vs. “them. ” The “them” may be Republican elites, or liberal elites, or migrants or Mexicans or Muslims. Trump would be elected on the promise of fighting, rounding up, jailing or humbling any number of personal and political opponents. Take away this appeal, and there is nothing left but grasping, pathetic vanity. The undercurrents of economic anxiety and cultural disorientation that Trump exploits are real, deserving both attention and sympathy. But Trump has organized these resentments with an unprecedented message: The United States is weak and broken, a hell of crime, terrorism and expanding misery, beset from within and without, and now in need of a strong hand  —   his strong hand  —   to turn things around.  The single most frightening,   phrase of modern presidential history came in Trump’s convention speech: “I alone can fix it. ” A Trump victory would be a mandate for authoritarian politics. Trump’s ambitions would be bounded by strong legislative and legal institutions and by his own risible ignorance of real leadership. But a Trump administration would be a concession to the idea that America needs a little more China, a little more Russia, a little more “so let it be written, so let it be done” in its executive branch.  I never imagined that Republican leaders  —   many of whom I know and have respected  —   would fall in line with such dangerous delusions, on the theory that anything is better than Hillary Clinton. Most options are better than Clinton. But not all. And not this. The GOP has largely accommodated itself to a candidate with no respect for, or knowledge of, the constitutional order. Every constitutional conservative should be revolted. Those who are complicit have adopted a particularly dangerous form of   hypocrisy.   But now, with polls tightening, it may not only be Republicans who abandon central tenets of their democratic faith. It is almost beyond belief that Americans should bless and normalize Trump’s appeal. Normalize vindictiveness and prejudice. Normalize bragging about sexual assault and the objectification of women. Normalize conspiracy theories and the abandonment of reason. Normalize contempt for the vulnerable, including disabled people and refugees fleeing oppression. Normalize a political tone that dehumanizes opponents and excuses violence. Normalize an appeal to white identity in a nation where racial discord and conflict are always close to the surface. Normalize every shouted epithet, every cruel ethnic and religious stereotype, every act of bullying in the cause of American “greatness. ” In the end, a Trump victory would normalize the belief that the structures of   are unequal to the crisis of our time.

"Ex-Auschwitz medic, 95, to stand trial for 3,681 deaths. A    man who worked as a paramedic at Auschwitz will stand trial next month as an accessory to the murder of 3, 681 death camp inmates, a German court announced Monday. Hubert Zafke, accused by prosecutors of serving as an SS sergeant in Hitler’s killing machine, is set to face justice Feb. 29 in Neubrandenburg state court. Zafke was stationed at Auschwitz in 1943 and 1944 and would have been on duty at the notorious death camp when diarist Anne Frank and her family were sent there on Sept. 5, 1944, authorities have said. Frank, whose writings on hiding from Nazis pursuers became the most famous book about the Holocaust, was later transferred to the   concentration camp, where she was killed.

"Obama blasts Trump as a phony champion of the working class.   PHILADELPHIA  —   President Obama implored Americans on Tuesday to consider the gravity of the presidential election eight weeks away, calling Republican Donald Trump a dangerous fraud who has no real idea of what it means to be president. Turning serious at the close of a rollicking campaign rally for Democrat Hillary Clinton, Obama allowed himself to “vent” about a Republican nominee who he said “isn’t fit in any way, shape or form to represent this country. ” With a note of exasperation, Obama said he had lost patience with the trivialities of a campaign dominated by what he called a   mentality. Obama also acknowledged some of Trump’s outsider appeal and likened it to his own. “Look, I understand. We’re a young country. We are a restless country,” Obama said. “We always like the new, shiny thing. I benefited from that when I was a candidate. And we take for granted sometimes what’s steady and true. And Hillary Clinton’s steady, and she is true. ” The rally was planned long before Clinton fell ill last weekend and canceled a planned West Coast campaigning and fundraising swing. Obama called no direct attention to her illness, even when someone in the crowd fainted and Obama told the crowd to do some knee bends and drink water.   President Obama speaks during a campaign event in Philadelphia to support Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. (Tracie Van   Pressphoto Agency)   [Clinton’s impulse to ‘power through’ with illness set off cascade of problems]  Obama first made a joke of Trump’s admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, an adversary of Obama’s throughout his presidency, but then sought to shame Trump. “I have to do business with Putin. I have to do business with Russia. That’s part of foreign policy. But I don’t go around saying: That’s my role model,” Obama said of the authoritarian former KGB agent. “Could you imagine Ronald Reagan idolizing somebody like that?” Obama mocked the Republican and novice candidate as a fraudulent champion for the working class, suggesting that the businessman is merely exploiting this year’s populist voter mood after a lifetime of gilded circumstances. “I keep on reading this analysis that Trump’s got support from, like, working folks,” Obama said. “Really? This is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people. ” During a midday rally in Clive, Iowa, Trump took sharp aim at Clinton and Obama, arguing that their policies have harmed the country and that Clinton’s character flaws disqualify her from being president.  “Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country,” Trump said. And as he has done repeatedly in recent days, he went after Clinton for labeling half his supporters a “a basket of deplorables. ”  Trump said he is running to “reverse” the policies of the past eight years and “create a future of prosperity for all Americans. ” Earlier in the day, Trump’s campaign issued a news release targeting Obama over his decision to campaign for Clinton. “Shouldn’t you be at work?” it said at the top, citing a series of economic and   problems.  Eight weeks to the day until Election Day, Obama appeared to revel in his star turn as Clinton’s defender. He said he “really, really, really” wants to see her elected and pledged to work hard on her behalf. “I could not be prouder of the leader we have nominated to take my place,” Obama said. “Even though I have run my last campaign, I am going to work as hard as I can this fall to elect Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States. ” But he seemed most energized when criticizing Trump. He left little doubt that he is on a personal mission to defeat the man who rose to political prominence as the celebrity proponent of the false “birther” theory that Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore not legitimately president. “This guy’s suddenly going to be your champion?” Obama asked. “I mean, he spent most of life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could, and now this guy’s going to be the champion of working people. Huh?” “I mean, he wasn’t going to let you on his golf course,” he added. “He wasn’t going to let you buy in his condo. And now suddenly this guy’s going to be your champion?” He drew laughs when he took aim at Trump’s charitable foundation, noting, as The Washington Post reported, that he “took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a    painting of himself. He had the taste not to go for the   version. ” Obama scolded the news media, saying it is applying “unfair” scrutiny to Clinton while grading Trump “on a curve. ”  Clinton had never planned to attend the event, which was part of a push to rally Democrats with the biggest names backing Clinton this year. Vice President Biden and Michelle Obama were also campaigning for Clinton this week.  Clinton’s campaign sent out Twitter messages quoting Obama while he made the case that she represents inclusion and diversity, compared with what Democrats call Trump’s message of division and bigotry. “All of us, young, old, men, women, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance to the same flag  —   that’s the America I know,” Obama said. “That’s the America you know and believe in. And there is just one candidate in this race who’s devoted her life to building that America. ” Obama is next expected on the trail in October, with a focus on young voters, blacks and Hispanics. Clinton’s strategists hope that Obama’s enduring popularity among Democrats, and his sway with African Americans and younger voters, can help Clinton overcome the difficult hurdle of winning a third term for the same political party. “It is good to be back on the campaign trail,” Obama said as he began some 40 minutes of remarks. Obama reflected on his fierce 2008 primary contest with Clinton, especially in Pennsylvania, where Clinton won the primary and kept her bid alive. “Every time I thought I had that race won, I was like going up the ‘Rocky’ steps,” Obama said. “I was about to celebrate, and then I looked. She’s right there. And I got whupped here in Pennsylvania. She whupped me. ” The enthusiastic crowd was gathered outdoors on a balmy   afternoon in front of the historic Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose front steps were featured in the Sylvester Stallone movie. Clinton has tied herself closely to Obama, whom she served as secretary of state, and gives him credit in nearly every speech for pulling the country out of the “ditch” of the Great Recession at the start of his tenure. No one, and certainly not Trump, really knows what it means to be president and make    decisions, Obama said. “Anybody can pop off,” he said. “Anybody can fire off a tweet. Everybody’s a critic. But that doesn’t mean you know what it’s like to manage a global crisis. You don’t know what it’s like to send a group of young people to war knowing some won’t come back. But the closest you can come to understanding what it’s like is to be where Hillary’s been, to have been part of those decisions. ”   Sean Sullivan in Clive contributed to this report.  ",-0.5
"Parkinson’s, the disease Muhammad Ali lived with for decades, explained.  Boxing legend and humanitarian Muhammad Ali died on Friday at the age of 74.    Though the cause of death was respiratory complications, Ali had battled Parkinson’s since 1984, when, three years after his retirement, he was diagnosed with the disease and became one of the world’s most famous people to battle it. Parkinson’s is a chronic, progressive disorder of the nervous system, and it’s typically discovered with the onset of symptoms that include hand tremors and body stiffness. When Ali was diagnosed, the disease was very poorly understood. Back then, researchers didn’t know that genes play a role, especially in people who start to experience symptoms before the age of 50  —   like Ali, who was 42.    Today, scientists believe Parkinson’s is caused by some mixture of genetic predisposition and triggers from the environment. But it remains a largely mysterious and vexing condition affecting an estimated 7 to 10 million people worldwide.    Ali’s star power helped draw a lot of attention to Parkinson’s. He lent his name to a Parkinson’s center at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, and appeared in TV spots to raise awareness about the disease (sometimes along with fellow patient Michael J. Fox). There are more research initiatives today to try to demystify the disease than ever before. But while Ali’s chosen occupation drew a lot of attention to a possible link with head injuries, even better understood is that the disease can be brought on after exposure to pesticides. Smoking, on the other hand, seems to protect people from Parkinson’s. Here are five facts to know about the disease.    1) Living in rural areas and doing farm work are clearly associated with Parkinson’s Researchers have isolated several genetic mutations linked to Parkinson’s, and testing is available for some of them. But interpretation of the tests is tricky because not everyone who carries the genetic mutations will develop Parkinson’s. Meanwhile, a less appreciated but even more certain risk factor is exposure to pesticides. ”It’s been recognized for 50 years that rates of Parkinson’s disease are higher in rural populations and in farmers,” Samuel Goldman, a Parkinson’s researcher at the University of California San Francisco, said. Researchers think pesticides are the key cause here, and even consider farming an occupational risk.    The   offenders are the pesticides rotenone and paraquat (which are now highly restricted and used only in very specific situations). There may be other chemicals linked to Parkinson’s, but human and animal studies have only so far shown a clear link between exposure to rotenone and paraquat and increased risk of the disease. Why these pesticides are associated with Parkinson’s is less clear. One hypothesis is that they seem to attack the brain cells that make dopamine, and it’s the degeneration of those cells that causes the disease. 2) The link between head injuries and Parkinson’s is less   The link between Parkinson’s and head injury is a little less clear, as the evidence has been somewhat contradictory, said Joseph Quinn, director of the Parkinson’s Center at Oregon Health and Science University. This may be, in part, because the question is really tricky to study. The disease typically appears late in life, decades after any head injuries, so cause and effect are difficult to tease out. Not to mention that many people have difficulty recalling old head injuries. There’s also no diagnostic tool available for Parkinson’s, which introduces more potential for misdiagnosis (more on that later). Still, Quinn thinks the balance of evidence favors an association here too. The reason head injuries may play a role is that they damage the   barrier, which keeps toxins out of the brain. ”When you get a head injury, the   barrier becomes leaky  —   and more nasty stuff from the environment or within your body is able to leak into the brain,” Goldman said.    3) The disease is very rare among people under 40, and men are at a much greater risk Two of the main risk factors for the disease are advanced age and being a man. It’s very rare for someone under 40 to be diagnosed, and the incidence rapidly increases over the age of 60. According to the National Parkinson Foundation, the average age of diagnosis is around 62. The disease also seems to be much more common among men than women, though the reason is still unclear. 4) There’s no diagnostic tool or cure for Parkinson’s Parkinson’s is brought on by the degeneration and death of the neurons in the part of the brain that produces dopamine. The main symptoms of the disease are tremor, bradykinesia (or slowness of movement) and rigidity. Onset of Parkinson’s is always asymmetric in the body, so one side is affected first. Goldman said clinicians have no diagnostic test to rely on, so they typically look for that asymmetry and then administer a dopamine therapy to see if some of the symptoms dissipate. If a patient responds to dopamine treatment, that means she more likely than not has Parkinson’s. There’s also no cure for Parkinson’s, nor is there a standard treatment. Doctors usually prescribe medicines (most commonly dopamine therapies) and lifestyle modifications (rest and exercise) or surgery (  stimulation). But these therapies simply control symptoms and can’t slow down disease progression or cure the disease.    5) Cigarette smoking seems to be protective This is definitely not a reason to take up cigarette smoking, but one incredibly consistent finding in the literature is that smokers seem to have much lower rates of the disease. ”There’s probably 100 papers about this,” Goldman said, but researchers still don’t quite understand why. One hypothesis is that nicotine may protect the nervous system from the disorder. Another, said Quinn, ”is that people who are prone to Parkinson’s   …     might just be less prone to smoke cigarettes as part of their genetic makeup.”  Watch: Ali’s biggest fights were outside the ring    ",-1.0
"Donald Trump’s threat to imprison Hillary Clinton is a threat to democracy.  There is no way to sugarcoat this: At Sunday night’s presidential debate, Donald Trump threatened to throw Hillary Clinton in jail if he wins the presidency. This  —   threatening to jail one’s political opponents  —   is how democratic norms die.    The exchange happened during a discussion of the controversy over Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Trump began by decrying Clinton’s conduct  —   which, according to the FBI, was quite bad but not illegal. He then proposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her, and warned Clinton that, if he were president now, “you’d be in jail”:  TRUMP:  I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, and I’m going to say it, and hate to say it: If I win, I’m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception   …     A very expensive process, so we’re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing   of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace, and honestly, you ought to be ashamed.  CLINTON: Let me just talk about emails, because everything he just said is absolutely false. But I’m not surprised   …     It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country.  DT: Because you’d be in jail.   This is so far beyond normal that it’s hard to even know where to start.     In democracies, we respect people’s rights to disagree with each other. When one candidate wins a presidential election, the loser returns to private life or another government position. In some cases, former rivals become close friends. George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who defeated Bush in the 1992 election, travel together and have spent decades jointly raising money to aid the victims of natural disasters.    They don’t get sent to jail, because we believe that political disagreement should be legal. Donald Trump doesn’t seem to care about all that. In his last line  —   “you’d be in jail”  —   he is outright saying that he would imprison Hillary Clinton in office (if he could). This comes despite the fact that there is no evidence Clinton committed a crime in her handling of the email servers, despite lengthy investigations that found evidence of carelessness and dishonesty. That would be a politically motivated prosecution  —   retribution for daring to run against Trump and attack him during the campaign.    This is everything we feared about Donald Trump. His long history of trying to silence critics with lawsuits, his inability to let personal slights go, his pettiness: The nightmare scenario is that these would incline him to use the power of the presidency to forcibly silence his critics and opponents. That’s what is done by   dictators spanning the globe from North Korea to Zimbabwe. That’s what happens in countries where peaceful transitions of power are the exception, not the rule. Donald Trump just threatened to bring that to America.   Watch: Trump is running for dictator, not president     ",-1.0
"Republicans already think Obamacare repeal is a nightmare. It’s about to get worse..          President Trump’s hilariously candid revelation that “nobody knew that health care could be so complicated” may be remembered as the most succinct summary of the Republicans’ dilemma as they try to fulfill their endlessly repeated promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. And now that things are about to get specific, what had been a dangerous situation for them is about to turn into a nightmare. Republicans are set to enter a new phase, in which actual bills are written, debated and possibly even voted on. It’s going to be the equivalent of sticking their heads up out the foxhole so that the other side has something to fix their sights on. If they thought this issue was hard before, they haven’t seen anything yet. Let’s start with House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) who apparently has a plan, one that’s going to go over so well that he’s terrified that anyone might get a look at it: House Republican leaders have a new version of their major Obamacare repeal and replacement bill. They just don’t want you to see it. The document is being treated a bit like a   surveillance intercept. It is expected to be available to members and staffers on the House Energy and Commerce panel starting Thursday, but only in a dedicated reading room, one Republican lawmaker and a committee aide said. Nobody will be given copies to take with them. That’s not the mark of a party confident that what it’s about to propose will be well received. Republicans are facing two problems at the moment, one external and one internal. The external problem is the public, which has grown increasingly wary of repeal as the possibility has become more real and attention has focused on what would actually be lost if the ACA disappears. Watch an interview with a Republican, and you’ll notice that a few common questions make them squirm. Here are some of them, including the real answers:  Can you promise that no one who has coverage now will lose it? (No.) Can you promise that    costs aren’t going to increase? (Those costs will increase, by design.) What does your plan do for people who are on the Medicaid expansion now, many for the first time? (Some might remain on it, at least in the short term, but there are no guarantees how many.) What happens to people who still can’t afford coverage after the tax credits you’re proposing? (They’re screwed.) Doesn’t your plan make things a lot more complicated for people with preexisting conditions? (Yes.) Doesn’t your plan constitute a giveaway to the rich? (Yes.)  Ryan can’t keep his plan secret forever. Once it’s unveiled, we’re going to have a lengthy and detailed debate about it, and those kinds of questions are going to be asked again and again. At some point the Congressional Budget Office will score the bill, and we’ll get a nonpartisan judgment of the wreckage it will cause. That will be a very bad day for Republicans. When Democrats passed the ACA in 2009, they didn’t pretend that it would create a perfect system without costing anything. But that’s what Republicans are promising now: They claim you’ll have great coverage, with all the flexibility you could want, for less money. Or as the president said in his address to Congress, they will “repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better health care. ” And every child gets a pony, while the adults will all have washboard abs, glowing skin and soft, manageable hair. So far, the public isn’t convinced. The popularity of the ACA has been rising, and members of Congress are being overwhelmed with calls, letters, emails and attendees at their town halls demanding that they not yank coverage and security away from tens of millions of Americans. But it’s important to realize that if they wanted, Republicans could power through all that, even if it represented a political risk. They could say, “This may not be popular, at least in the short run, but we think it’s the right thing to do, so we’re going to do it anyway. ” There are some obstacles (particularly the filibuster in the Senate) but they have control of the entire government, and they could make it happen if they were determined enough. But it would require unanimity on the particulars of what    looks like  —   which brings us to their internal problem. Right now they can’t agree on what a replacement should be, and the disagreements aren’t minor at all. It isn’t as though one group of Republicans thinks there should be a $4, 000 tax credit for people to buy insurance, and another group thinks it should be $5, 000. The disagreements go much deeper. For instance, Freedom Caucus members in the House (the chamber’s most extreme conservatives) have threatened not to support any bill that doesn’t repeal the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, which has resulted in around 14 million additional poor Americans getting covered. Your average Republican doesn’t like the Medicaid expansion either, but many of them also realize that now that all those people are covered, kicking them off would be a political (not to mention a humanitarian) disaster. For example: “I’m very concerned about [a proposal] that would repeal Medicaid expansion,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( . Va.) said Wednesday. “I don’t think we’re going to go that direction. I hope not, in the House or here, but that would be a major source of concern for me. ” Asked if she is concerned about the House plan, which would repeal the extra federal money for Medicaid expansion, Capito said, “Yeah, I mean we need the extra federal money. ” Sens. Dean Heller ( .) Lisa Murkowski ( ) and Rob Portman ( ) also have concerns about repealing the Medicaid expansion. Three of them voting no would be enough to sink a bill in the Senate. But conservative senators, who demand that the Medicaid expansion be repealed, also have enough votes to sink a bill. Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) Rand Paul ( .) and Mike Lee ( ) say that Republicans must vote again on the sweeping repeal bill passed in 2015, which did away with the Medicaid expansion. What do West Virginia, Nevada, Alaska and Ohio have in common? They all accepted the law’s expansion of Medicaid, so those members’ constituents are at risk. And that’s not all. Cruz, Paul and Lee also object to a provision in the emerging plan that would replace the ACA’s subsidies for   people with tax credits that could be used to buy insurance. Even though the tax credits would be far less generous and wouldn’t be given according to income (so Bill Gates would get the same credit that someone of his age working at McDonald’s would) that’s still too much for those conservatives, who consider it an “entitlement” that violates their   principles. So you’ve got   who aren’t willing to accept a   (backed up by   pressure groups) at odds with ordinary conservatives who’d like something that minimizes the upheaval and political risk of repeal. Their differences look irreconcilable, and if either group bails, repeal is dead. It’s even possible that what Ryan and other leaders come up with will be unacceptable to both groups, losing support from both the right and the left within the GOP. If there’s a solution to that conflict, no one seems to have located it yet.",-0.5
"Trump’s Department of Justice just reopened business for private prisons.  Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has reopened its doors to business from private prisons. On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions made it public that he rescinded a guidance that tasked the Justice Department with ending its use of privately operated prisons.    Last year’s memo by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates came after the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found serious problems and more frequent reports of violence at privately run,   facilities compared with federal public prisons. In total, the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was to stop contracting with private operators at around a dozen prisons  —   although the terminations were set to take years as the federal agency let existing contracts expire instead of ending them prematurely. The private BOP facilities don’t make up a big part of all the prisons in America or even a big segment of private prisons overseen by the federal government. There are thousands of prisons, including local jails and state prisons, all across the country  —   122 of which are run by the Bureau of Prisons. And even with this announcement, other federal agencies would continue to rely on private prisons, particularly the   immigrant detention facilities overseen by the US Department of Homeland Security but run mostly by   private companies.    Still, the decision is sure to upset liberals, many of whom blame private prisons for perpetuating mass incarceration. But it will likely come as welcome news to conservatives, who see private prisons as a cheaper alternative to public ones  —   even as the data suggests that private facilities may be more dangerous.    What OIG’s investigation into private prisons found Generally, privately run federal prisons  —   known as “contract prisons”  —   house   inmates, typically undocumented male immigrants. So the comparisons in the 2016 OIG report weren’t to   facilities, but to other   prisons run by the US Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  “We found that in a majority of the categories we examined, contract prisons incurred more safety and security incidents per capita than comparable BOP institutions,” the report concluded, based on its analysis of 14 private prisons and 14 public prisons from fiscal years 2011 to 2014.    OIG found problems in six categories: contraband, reports of incidents, lockdowns, inmate discipline, telephone monitoring, and selected grievances. Private prisons reportedly had fewer positive drug tests and reported incidents of sexual misconduct. “For example, the contract prisons confiscated eight times as many contraband cell phones annually on average as the BOP institutions,” the report found. “Contract prisons also had higher rates of assaults, both by inmates on other inmates and by inmates on staff. ” Privately run facilities also consistently put inmates in solitary confinement units just because they didn’t have enough room to put them with the general population  —   a violation of federal rules for solitary. And the private prisons appeared to provide inadequate medical care to inmates.    The report had a big limitation: It couldn’t examine all the factors that contributed to these differences, including the effects of inmate demographics and facility locations. And some of the numbers could be misleading; for example, maybe inmates were more willing to report sexual misconduct in public facilities, which suggests that public facilities could be better at handling sexual misconduct even if they have more reports of it. But the findings were bad enough that OIG recommended the federal government take more serious actions to oversee privately run prisons. And the BOP responded with swift force, with plans to cancel contracts on its remaining 13 private facilities. Private prisons aren’t a big part of the US prison system, but they have problems where they exist Privately run prisons are a sizable part of America’s prison system, but not even close to a majority. They hold about 18 percent of federal prisoners and 7 percent of state prisoners, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. (More than 87 percent of all prisoners in America are in state facilities.)            As I’ve written before, this shows that private prisons aren’t really the drivers of mass incarceration  —   a popular belief held by liberals  —   but instead a response to it: Once public prisons got too crowded, legislators around the country began to seek out less expensive options to take in some of the new prisoners. So private prisons began holding inmates on the margins. Still, where private prisons do exist, they seem to pose extraordinary problems. The OIG report isn’t the first to indicate that private prisons are worse off, although it’s the most recent one. A 2001 report from the Department of Justice found the rate of    violence at private prisons was 38 percent higher than the rate at public prisons. And in a   undercover investigation, reporter Shane Bauer witnessed high levels of violence  —   particularly stabbings, which seemingly went underreported in official numbers  —   and lockdowns at a private prison in Louisiana.    The problems in private facilities generally follow the same theme: They seem to have big problems staffing up, because private prisons’   motive incentivizes the facilities to keep salaries and staff numbers low. As a result, the limited number of guards can’t handle, deter, or stop outbreaks of violence as effectively as a bigger staff in, say, a public prison can. And even though state and federal governments are supposed to oversee these prisons, it’s harder to do that indirectly through a private contractor than directly through your own publicly hired and managed staff. This doesn’t mean public prisons are pristine. There are plenty of terrible stories from public facilities, such as Pelican Bay in California and Rikers Island in New York City. Last year, I reported on a transgender inmate’s horrific experience through multiple public prisons, where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted and brutalized as public prison officials did little about it. But based on the available data, it does seem private prisons are even worse. Proponents of private prisons argue that they can save money, since private companies can run them more efficiently. The OIG report cautions against that conclusion, given the problems that come with private prisons. But even if the claim is true, the savings may not be worth the extra dangers that come to staff and inmates at private prisons. As Yates noted in her memo, “Bottom line, I’d also say, you get what you pay for. ” Sessions, apparently, disagrees.  Watch: How mandatory minimums helped drive mass incarceration     ",-1.0
"The Republican loyalists who’ve learned to love Donald Trump.  WAKEFIELD, MA  —   ”People used to be afraid to say, ’I’m a Republican.’ And now, look at this room,” Bob Finneran told the hundreds of Massachusetts Republicans crammed into the main hall of the Elks Lodge in a northern exurb of Boston. ”Donald Trump did this.”    The Massachusetts Republicans were gathered for district caucuses on April 30 to select which delegates would represent the state at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in June. Enthusiastic Trump supporters swarmed places like the Wakefield Elks Lodge. And the longtime Republicans running the caucus were more than happy to see them. In Washington, DC, and in intellectual circles, many Republicans and conservatives are openly horrified by the fact that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But if you want to know whether    Republicans are going to embrace Trump now that he’s the presumptive nominee, you might want to look to places like Wakefield. Longtime Republicans weren’t just reconciled to Trump. They were embracing him and the passion he’d inspired. They’ve convinced themselves that Trump is their ticket back to the White House in November.    State Rep. Brad Jones  —   the leader of Massachusetts’s (admittedly small) Republican House minority  —   had to wait nearly 40 minutes to call the caucus to order, so that volunteers could sign in all the attendees who’d been lining up to enter since 7:30 am. ”This is by far the largest caucus in the Sixth District I have ever seen,” he said when he finally greeted the room.    A couple of shouts from the assembled  —   not quite a chant, but just short of one  —   answered the question Jones didn’t need to ask: ”Trump! Trump!”         Trump excited inactive Republicans. Their excitement excites party stalwarts. Despite Bob Finneran’s claim, the Sixth District isn’t exactly hostile territory for Republicans. Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, comes from the area  —   though Baker, a moderate who has said he will not support Trump in the general, made the perhaps wise decision to skip the delegate caucus. State Rep. Jones chaired the caucus.    The town of Wakefield went strongly for Scott Brown in the 2010 special election  —   more than 60 percent of voters chose him over Martha Coakley  —   and surrounding towns in the Sixth District preferred Brown as well. But the fact of the matter is that the Sixth District is in Massachusetts  —   or, as attendees almost always referred to it, ”Taxachusetts”  —   and attendees at Saturday’s caucus weren’t used to thinking of Massachusetts as anything but a deep blue state. So the palpable excitement that Donald Trump has generated became, itself, exciting; it became a sign that Trump could win a general election for the Republican Party. Over and over,   delegates in Wakefield  —   in the awed but welcoming tone of people who’ve just been given a tremendous gift  —   invoked two statistics that purported to prove how powerful a candidate Trump would be. One was Trump’s performance in ”liberal Massachusetts’s” Republican primary: 49 percent of the vote. (The fact that this was only among Republicans, not among all voters, went unmentioned.)    The other: ”20, 000 Democrats in Massachusetts switched parties,” several delegate candidates said, to support Trump. Massachusetts did see almost 20, 000 Democrats change their registrations in the weeks before the March 1 primary, though only about 3, 600 of them became Republicans (and therefore eligible to help elect delegates in Wakefield). None of the Trump supporters I talked to in Wakefield were recent  . Some were   voters, or former   supporters  —   Ron Paul types  —   who’d been impressed by Trump. But many, or even most, were people who’d been Republican for a while but hadn’t necessarily been active in the party. Donald Trump had gotten them legitimately enthusiastic. Attendees started lining up 90 minutes before the doors opened at the Elks Lodge in Wakefield. Eighteen candidates  —   almost all of them Trump supporters  —   ran for the first two delegate slots.             Cruz backers were anxious to stay on Trump supporters’ good sides In other states, the   Ted Cruz campaign had outhustled the Trumpists. But in Massachusetts, the Trump operation put exhaustive amounts of effort into getting its supporters to the caucuses   —   and it worked. ”I’ve been making phone calls, a lot of emails, a lot of online,” said   delegate Arete Castucci  —   taking off her heels in the women’s powder room, after more than six hours of being on her feet. ”Telling people to come out, who to vote for.” She was exhausted, but relieved: ”I have friends in other districts, and it’s very good turnout all over the state.”    If the number of people wearing Trump stickers (handed out, along with Dunkin’ Donuts, by the Trump campaign at a table outside the lodge) Trump shirts, ”Make America Great Again” hats, and ”Trump ’16: Put Another Brick in the Wall” buttons weren’t a clear enough indication of how the room felt, the enthusiastic shouts greeting any delegate candidate who pledged to support Trump certainly were. It was enough to put the   delegates who supported other candidates on the defensive. Some of John Kasich’s chosen delegates attempted to defend their man to a room full of Trump supporters, pointing to polls that show Kasich as the Republican who most consistently beats Hillary Clinton. The Trump supporters were not convinced  —   they nearly drowned out one   delegate with shouts of, ”Trump!”   delegates who supported Ted Cruz, meanwhile  —   most of them longtime Republican insiders  —   tended to keep their allegiances close to the chest. They were more concerned with preserving the goodwill of Trump loyalists (and interested in stoking the surge of Republican interest) than they were in taking a stand for their candidate.         They talked about their résumés as Republican campaign workers and party officials; they stressed the need to have ”a voice for Massachusetts” at the national convention; they talked about the importance of a unified Republican Party to beat Hillary Clinton in November. The Trump supporters were neither impressed nor fooled. Even lines that would be guaranteed applause in any other context  —   ”Who thinks any of our candidates would be better than Hillary Clinton?”  —   were greeted with suspicion by Trump supporters who were really only there to support one candidate. Only one   delegate  —   Andrew Kingman, a former supporter of Marco Rubio running for the slot pledged to the Florida senator on the first ballot  —   had the   (or, if you prefer,  ) to condemn the Trumpists to their faces. ”To support Mr. Trump as the nominee is to retreat from our history” as the party of Lincoln and Reagan, he told the crowd with tense determination.    ”Traitor!” a Trump supporter shouted back. The Republican Party, Kingman continued, should not exclude people who look different, ”who believe differently, who love differently.” One heckler, in a voice that wouldn’t quite have been audible if the rest of the room weren’t so angrily quiet, tried to complete the sentence for him:  ” —   who are losers!” Trump brought in new people, but how invested are they in the Republican Party? Some party insiders were happy to embrace Trump early on. One of the delegates endorsed by the Trump campaign, Amy Carnevale   —   the one who tried to start her speech by getting everyone to agree that all the Republicans were better than Hillary Clinton  —   is a Republican state committee member and a lobbyist. As a delegate for Mitt Romney four years ago, Carnevale was involved in some   drama that resulted in the booting of a Ron Paul delegate from the convention. So some longtime conservative activists in the Sixth District found it deeply disconcerting, and deeply suspicious, that they and Carnevale were on the same side in 2016  —   and that she’d been endorsed by the Trump campaign to represent them in Cleveland. ”That’s just amazing. I would like to know what’s going on,” said activist Larry Way as the votes were tallied. ”I think we know what they’re trying to do. I think they’re part of the ’stop Trump’ movement.” Some conservative activists had tried to mount a ”Liberty” slate of delegates as an alternative to insiders like Carnevale  —   to save the Trump candidacy (they believed) from its own endorsed delegates. ”Can you trust Amy Carnevale to support Donald Trump?” asked Liberty delegate Evan Kenney. Ultimately the answer was that, yes, they did. The     suspected the Liberty slate of having another agenda  —   some thought they were Ted Cruz supporters, others thought they were Paul types (who were agreed to be okay on some issues, but dangerous on others).    In the end, the candidates who won were endorsed by the Trump campaign itself. Nothing else mattered.             Even when Trump supporters didn’t agree with the campaign’s decisions, they obeyed its instructions. Scott Hayes, the last   candidate of the day (for the alternate for the   slot) was a   substitution for another, presumably   candidate. His speech veered into allegations that ”ISIS has completely infiltrated the US” and the Saudis are ”so successful in our colleges that now they’re in our K through 5!” Some of the Trump supporters in the room looked askance at Hayes. But his comments didn’t matter. They’d written the name down before Hayes even got up to speak. They weren’t here to make their own judgments; they were here for Donald Trump. The   caucus attendees had no interest whatsoever in   infighting  —   and it wasn’t at all clear how much interest they had in the Republican party beyond its presidential frontrunner. But in Wakefield, and in the rest of Massachusetts  —   and, as the party unites around Trump, in other places throughout the country as well  —   Republicans aren’t looking a gift horse in the mouth. They’ve learned to love Trump supporters. They’ve learned to love Donald Trump.  Watch: Why Donald Trump can’t win a general election    ",-1.0
"The latest trend I loathe in restaurants: No space between tables.       Several winters ago, Meagan Foster and her   were trying to turn a bad day around by venturing to the Tabard Inn for drinks and dinner. But when she tried to navigate the sliver of space between her table and the next, Foster says, she bumped everything  —   votive, water, silverware  —   off both of them, and promptly burst into tears. The incident didn’t scar her for life; the District resident and her boyfriend were later married at the Dupont Circle spot. But whenever they go back, they make sure to avoid the banquettes, or what she called the “booth tables,” along one wall. She’s not the only diner tired of playing ballet dancer or contortionist (in my case, sucking in my gut) for the privilege of a meal away from home. To access some of the more tightly packed tables around Washington, anyone who’s not a string bean is forced to enter seats sideways, sometimes on tiptoe, and invade a neighbor’s space in one of two ways: by butt or by crotch. Inadvertent fat shaming ensues.  [No reservations? This restaurant trend has become harder to swallow.]  Like airlines, restaurants seem to be trimming personal space in an attempt to pack in more customers, and this at a time when the average man and woman are 30 and 26 pounds heavier, respectively, than they were in 1960. (That’s 196 and 166 pounds.) Whoever came up with the Knee Defender, the gadget that prevents airline seats from reclining, might contemplate its equivalent for cramped restaurants, because diners would likely snap it up. A Zagat survey from two years ago found that “crowds” ranked just behind service, noise and prices as a chief complaint among  .     Mike Friedman, a   of   says more tables could have been squeezed into the space, but that it would have disrupted server flow and taxed the small kitchen. (Dixie D.   The Washington Post) The average   table (or “deuce” in industry jargon) measures 24 by 30 inches, says Stephani Robson, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University who specializes in restaurant design psychology. There’s no industry standard (or fire code) for distance between tables, but Robson considers 16 inches a good minimum at banquettes, where space is usually tightest. “Your guests will thank you for it,” she says. Armed with a tape measure on recent restaurant rounds, I discovered some tables (not all of them banquettes) set a mere foot apart at   in Shaw, Estadio on 14th Street NW and Joselito Casa De Comidas on Capitol Hill. At the 14th Street branch of Busboys & Poets, the socially conscious eatery treats customers as if they were sardines. Ten inches separates some seats. At the Tabard Inn, where earlier this month a diner knocked a pepper grinder into my buttered bread as she squeezed into the banquette beside me, I found two tables with only eight inches between them.   [Spring Dining Guide 2017]  That’s just about the length of a pencil. The stakes are high. Aaron Allen, a global restaurant consultant, says a   restaurant that can fit in “just one more   has increased their capacity  —   and revenue capacity  —   by 10 percent. ” Mike Friedman, a   of   thinks his restaurant’s intimate seating promotes a “convivial nature” that’s in keeping with its   theme. While he could have squeezed more tables into the space, Friedman says he didn’t, because they would have disrupted server flow and taxed the small kitchen. But the restaurateur also says that removing even a single table would mean saying arrivederci to “hundreds of thousands of dollars” a year.    At Estadio, some tables are about a foot apart. (Tracy A.   Washington Post) The sense of crowdedness has been exacerbated in recent years by chefs and diners themselves. Blame the former for blanketing tables with small plates, menus the size of posters and flights of food and drink. Patrons, meanwhile, are unloading on the table their laptops and smartphones (because you never know when you might need to snap some food porn). Rising interest in European concepts brings with them   seating.  [Quirky menus befuddle hungry diners]  Take the   Joselito, where owner Javier Candon says he wanted to evoke “Old World cafe” charm when he opened in January. Aiming to   the feel of Seville and Madrid, he bought small tables and set them so close that servers bumped into one another, silverware routinely fell to the floor and at least one chicken consommé created an oily slick when a diner bumped into a tray holding the broth. Candon ended up removing two tables. “For those that are uncomfortable about the shrinking personal space we once enjoyed,” Allen says via email, “we’ll have to remind ourselves this is the new normal and pretend we’re Parisian. ”  Age, sex and geography, says Robson, influence tolerance levels. Older women, she thinks, are more sensitive to being wedged into a dining room than their younger counterparts, due partly to diminished hearing. (Witness how some restaurants make a show of offering the inside seat to a woman by pulling a table out to let her slip into her seat  —   where she’s entombed until she needs to get up.) In     cities such as New York, locals are less bothered by restaurant confines than outsiders.     Tables at the Smith in Penn Quarter are close together, and the owner says it creates a fun environment where strangers dining next to each other become friends. (Deb Lindsey   The Washington Post) In a 2009 study in a New York restaurant, the recently closed Public in SoHo, Robson found that diners spent less time and less money at seats that were close together. Customers with 12 inches between tables stayed an average of 110 minutes and spent 73 cents a minute. Those with six inches between tables stayed an average of 102 minutes and spent 66 cents a minute. The study didn’t explore overall economic effect, but as Robson said, “In a restaurant with a lot of demand, the goal is to turn tables quickly. Putting them close together accomplishes that. ” Designers find themselves trying to serve two masters: restaurant owners eager to maximize floor space and diners who might enjoy some elbow room  —   or not, says architect Herb Heiserman, managing principal with Street sense, whose restaurant clients include   the Columbia Room, the Dabney and other hot spots around Washington. “Not everybody looks for a private zone,” he says. Some diners see restaurants as an extension of their families, he adds, and don’t mind the closeness.    banquettes give restaurants the greatest amount of flexibility, allowing them to easily push tables together or pull them apart to accommodate different party sizes. For patrons seeking privacy, full booths are popular, given their physical barriers to other diners. One way designers can make up for the lack of privacy is to use objects such as table lamps, props that establish boundaries, however small. “Our number one goal with design is to create a fun environment,” says Jeffrey Lefcourt, founder and managing partner of the Smith in Penn Quarter, a New York import where the small tables and tight seating practically allow neighboring diners to taste one another’s food. Instead of looking at each table as if a price tag were attached, he prefers to view seating as a social enhancer. The formula seems to be working: Diners have sent his company photos of strangers who have become friends in his restaurants.     The space between tables at Plume in the Jefferson Hotel is generous, and comes at a cost. (James M.   The Washington Post) On the other end of the spectrum, pools of space are, for the most part, a luxury. Consider the stately Plume in the Jefferson Hotel, where tables are set an impressive four to five feet apart. “Diners want to relax and not hear the conversation of the next diner,” says restaurant manager Sean Mulligan. Such privacy comes at a cost: The check average at Plume is $150  —   a person.  Speaking of conversation, private talk can easily go public in tight environs. Breakups, makeups  —   I feel like I’ve heard it all sitting in close proximity to fellow diners. “When do you testify?” I overheard a woman ask her companion at Tosca, the lobbyist favorite downtown. “I’m a womanizer. He’s worse than me!” one man recently shared with his table mates (and me) at the Partisan in Penn Quarter. Whether they want to or not, diners seated    become Gladys Kravitzes.  “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard things that I’m not supposed to hear,” says frequent   Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. “Not state secrets,” he says, but not information fellow diners would share publicly about, say, campaign missteps or awful bosses.   Hardly unique to Washington, tight seating is a problem shared by walking cities with high rents: New York, San Francisco, Chicago in particular.     The proximity of diners at restaurants such as the Partisan in Penn Quarter makes for limited privacy. (Greg   The Washington Post) Chef Jimmy Bannos Jr. of the Purple Pig in Chicago has a Rising Star medallion from the James Beard Foundation, “but if he swung it in his dining room,” says Phil Vettel, restaurant critic for the Chicago Tribune, “he’d kill someone. ”  How cramped is cramped?

"Cities begin to challenge a bedrock of justice: They’re paying criminals not to kill.        RICHMOND, Calif.  —   The odds were good that Lonnie Holmes, 21, would be the next person to kill or be killed in this   suburb north of San Francisco. Four of his cousins had died in shootings. He was a passenger in a car involved in a   shooting, police said. And he was arrested for carrying a loaded gun. But when Holmes was released from prison last year, officials in this city offered something unusual to try to keep him alive: money. They began paying Holmes as much as $1, 000 a month not to commit another gun crime. Cities across the country, beginning with the District of Columbia, are moving to copy Richmond’s controversial approach because early indications show it has helped reduce homicide rates. But the program requires governments to reject some basic tenets of law enforcement even as it challenges notions of appropriate ways to spend tax dollars. In Richmond, the city has hired   to mentor dozens of its most violent offenders and allows them to take unconventional steps if it means preventing the next homicide. For example, the mentors have coaxed inebriated teenagers threatening violence into city cars, not for a ride to jail but home to sleep it off  —   sometimes with loaded firearms still in their waistbands. The mentors have funded trips to South Africa, London and Mexico City for rival gang members in the hope that shared experiences and time away from the city streets would ease tensions and forge new connections. And when the elaborate efforts at engagement fail, the mentors still pay those who pledge to improve, even when, like Holmes, they are caught with a gun, or worse  —   suspected of murder. The   mentors operate at a distance from police. To maintain the trust of the young men they’re guiding, mentors do not inform police of what they know about crimes committed. At least twice, that may have allowed suspected killers in the stipend program to evade responsibility for homicides.    Police officers guard the scene of a fatal shooting of a    boy in Richmond, Calif. (Jahi   Washington Post)  And yet, interest in the program is surging among urban politicians. Officials in Miami, Toledo, Baltimore and more than a dozen cities in between are studying how to replicate Richmond’s program. The District of Columbia is first in line. Implementing the Richmond model has emerged as a central fight this year between D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and the D. C. Council. Bowser (D) is opposed to the strategy, arguing that the city should instead use its resources to fund jobs programs and that there is little independent analysis of the Richmond program. The mayor did not include money for it in her proposed 2017 budget released Thursday, and Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said she is skeptical of the need for the   program and has not seen sufficient data to verify its results. She and Kevin Donahue, Bow ser’s deputy mayor for public safety, question the veracity of Richmond’s claims of having saved so many of the city’s most violent offenders, since mentors  —   and not police  —   pick the participants and there has not been a control group used to measure outcomes. “There’s never been a real evaluation of the program,” Lanier said. “They didn’t design the program to allow it to be evaluated,” Donahue added.  But this month, the D. C. Council unanimously approved the idea as the best response to a surge of violent deaths that rocked the city last year. D. C. Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (  5) has promised to shift money from the mayor’s other   priorities to launch the program. He said the successes in Richmond cannot be ignored by city leaders serious about reducing crime.  [D. C. could be the next city to pay criminals to stay out of trouble ]  That’s because five years into Richmond’s   experiment, 84 of 88 young men who have participated in the program remain alive, and 4 in 5 have not been suspected of another gun crime or suffered a bullet wound, according to DeVone Boggan, founder of the Richmond effort.     DeVone Boggan is the director of the Office of Neighborhood Safety in Richmond, Calif. (Jahi   Washington Post)     Youngsters chat with “neighborhood change agents” of the Office of Neighborhood Safety in Richmond, Calif. (Jahi   Washington Post)    City leaders credit the program with cutting Richmond’s homicide rate to less than half and helping it shed its reputation as one of the nation’s deadliest cities. Those results have won over a pair of Richmond police chiefs, a series of mayors and even a   City Council, which continues to fund it despite budget shortfalls. “Richmond was bold enough to take an untested step and try this model of really direct and intense intervention,” Richmond Police Chief Allwyn Brown said. “And it’s dealing with the violence in the right way: teaching these kids basic life skills and how to not resort to a gun and operate in a civil society. ”  Richmond’s decision to pay people tostay out of trouble began a decade ago during a period of despair. In 2007, Richmond’s homicide tally had surged to 47, making it the country’s   city per capita. In the 20 years prior to that, Richmond lost 740 people to gun violence, and more than 5, 000 had been injured by a bullet. Elected leaders of the heavily African American port city of about 100, 000 began treating homicides as a public health emergency.    Residents gather where a    boy was fatally shot in Richmond, Calif. (Jahi   Washington Post)  Boggan, who had lost a brother in a shooting in Michigan, came up with the controversial core of the program after reading about a paid business school fellowship. He wondered whether troubled young men couldn’t be approached the same way and be paid to improve their lives. But he had to raise the money because he couldn’t persuade officials to give tax dollars directly to violent firearms offenders. He hired men who had served time across San Francisco Bay at California’s notorious San Quentin State Prison, often for their own gun crimes on the streets of Richmond. Boggan and his streetwise crew of   selected an initial group of 21 gang members and suspected criminals for the program. One night in 2010, he persuaded them to come to city hall, where he invited them to work with mentors and plan a future without guns. As they left, Boggan surprised each one with $1, 000  —   no strings attached. “No cop had ever handed them money without asking for something in return,” Boggan said. “And it had the intended effect. It sent a shock wave through the community. People sat up and began watching. ” Boggan’s Operation Peacemaker Fellowship is working with its fourth class of recruits, and he no longer needs to wow participants with money upfront. Dozens of former fellows on the streets of Richmond  —   still alive and not in jail  —   are his best advertisement, he said. Those in the program begin by drafting a “life map” and setting goals  —   such as applying for a job, going back to school or communicating better with family. They meet with facilitators who, unbeknown to the young men, are psychologists or sociologists. Together, they talk through issues in what amounts to stealth therapy sessions.    Youngsters attend a   class at the Office of Neighborhood Safety in Richmond, Calif. to discuss goals. (Jahi   Washington Post)  If they remain engaged for six months, meeting with mentors several times a week, they start to receive monthly payments between $1 and $1, 000, depending on their level of participation. The maximum amount paid is $9, 000 over the   fellowship. The program has handed out $70, 000 a year, on average, since 2010, Boggan said. Boggan believes that travel is another key to the program’s success. He sets aside $10, 000 per fellow for trips that are often the first time participants have left the state or the country. But fellows must agree to partner with someone they have either tried to kill or who attempted to kill them. “Wild, right?” Boggan says. “But they get out there and realize, ‘Hey, this cat’s just like me.’ ” Boggan’s measure of success: No fellows who have traveled together have been suspected in subsequent shootings against one another. Boggan and his staff are used to questions  —   and criticism  —   about the money. How do they know it doesn’t go to drugs? Or even bullets? They maintain that the money is an indispensable tool, a way to keep kids engaged long enough to make a difference in their lives. “This is controversial, I get it,” Boggan said. “But what’s really happening is that they are getting rewarded for doing really hard work, and it’s definite hard work when you talk about stopping picking up a gun to solve your problems. ” Sam Vaughn, a senior mentor, is more direct as he sits behind the wheel of a   sedan on a recent morning, cruising a neighborhood looking for those who are in the program. “We don’t know where it goes, and I’m not sure we always would want to know where it goes,” he said. Program managers, such as Vaughn, say they hope that the young men come to realize that the money is best spent on bills and making progress toward a safe, secure livelihood. He offers his own past as a cautionary tale: He beat a man into a vegetative state with the barrel of a gun and served 10 years in prison.    Sam Vaughn, left, and James Houston are ”neighborhood change agents” with the Office of Neighborhood Safety in Richmond, Calif. who are trying to curb shootings. (Jahi   Washington Post)  Vaughn turns a corner and stops at the sight of a black car parked in front of a row of vacant houses pockmarked by bullet holes. Holmes rolls down his window upon seeing Vaughn. A cloud of marijuana smoke escapes into the rainy morning. So far, the attention  —   and money  —   seems to be working for Holmes. Although the $1, 500 he has received since getting out of prison last fall has not led to a miraculous transformation, it enabled him to make a down payment on his black 2015 Nissan Versa  —   something meaningful for a young man who for many years was homeless. He now spends hours each day in the car, driving around with friends, often smoking pot but not “hunting”  —   Vaughn’s term for seeking conflict with rivals. Holmes is worried about how he’ll afford the $500 monthly car payments and insurance once the program ends. He has applied to get a legitimate job as an Uber driver. Money from the program has helped Holmes stay straight, he said. “The money is a big part,” Holmes says. “I can’t count the number of times it has kept me from . . . doing what I’ve got to do. It stopped me from going to hit that liquor [store] or this, you feel me, it’s a relief to not have to go do this and endanger my life for a little income, you feel me?” Holmes hits up Vaughn for $5 for a quart of oil. Vaughn tries to use it as a teachable moment and reaches into his pocket. “You’ve got to protect your investment  —   you need an oil change,” Vaughn explains.     Lonnie Holmes, 21, left, says “If they do this in D. C. definitely, I think it will keep robberies down. ” Next to him is Tommie Woods, 19. (Jahi   Washington Post)     Lonnie Holmes, 21, chats with “neighborhood change agents” with the Office of Neighborhood Safety. Four of his cousins have died in shootings. (Jahi   Washington Post)    Holmes settles back in the car and picks up a new blunt passed from a buddy in the back seat. He paused before inhaling. “If they do this in D. C. definitely, I think it will keep robberies down,” he said.    Nothing in the Richmond approach is black and white. Mentors operate with the support of the city in an ethical gray zone, often trying to anticipate the next shooting before it happens and then using the levers of the stipend and relationships to diffuse conflict before it turns violent. Success one day can morph into a setback the next, and consequences can be fatal. On a recent day, three of the program’s 20 fellows sat in jail, charged with violating parole restrictions after they gathered with suspected gang members. One of them also was carrying a gun when police descended on the hangout, which means he could face a long term if convicted. There have been worse failures. Four of the program’s fellows have died since 2010, including two who were killed by other fellows, said Boggan and Vaughn. The suspected killers have not been charged and remain in the program. “We’ve still got to deal with that fellow,” Vaughn said. “Because who’s to keep him from killing another one . . . ?” Although the program appears to largely be working for its small group of recruits, homicides citywide are rising again, raising questions about its wider impact across Richmond. After reaching a record low 11 homicides in 2014, killings nearly doubled in Richmond last year and are on pace to match that again this year. And Boggan, 49, and Vaughn, 39, say their fourth class of recruits, younger than the first three  —   are progressing surprisingly slowly, and the mentors acknowledge that they are having a harder time connecting with the class of “youngsters. ” Vaughn and other mentors gather each morning to scour fellows’ Facebook and Instagram accounts, noting emojis of guns and bullets and references to past killings for signs of brewing conflict.    Family and friends leave the burial place earlier this month of a    boy who was fatally shot at close range. He was two months shy of his birthday. (Jahi   Washington Post)  But two killings in the past month  —   of a    and     —   have pierced the aura of success. For all the efforts by the mentors to identify the most likely to be caught in violence and bring them into the program, they weren’t aware of either of the victims.  Many details of how the District would replicate Richmond’s program have yet to be determined, but one aspect is clearly more complicated than in Richmond. While the California strategy relies on private donors to fund the stipends and travel, D. C. would likely use roughly a   dollars annually in taxpayer money. Asked whether he could justify the expense if it came from the city’s general fund, Richmond Mayor Tom Butt was uncertain. “I’d try really hard to find outside funding,” he said. Vaughn applauds D. C. for proposing to use tax dollars, because he said it would give city residents and leaders a stake in the program’s success. The proof of whether it’s working will be seen in the city’s homicide tally, he said. “We don’t have any model fellows  —   we’re not graduating law school students here,” said Vaughn. “All we’re trying to do is to get these guys to stop killing each other. ”     var urlRegex= (’b( https):’ ’ [   +&@#’ %? =~_|! :,.;]*[   +&@#’ %=~_|])endPointString=”Map( pattern  ’x3e https:  . archive.   :  . washingtonpost.       id  ’x3e poll, content  ’x3e Simple Id Content Config)”,WPGames=WPGames|| ;WPGames. common=WPGames. common|| ;WPGames. common. api=WPGames. common. api|| ;WPGames. common. api[”    ”]=endPointString. match( urlRegex)[0]. replace( ’ ’ $””);var shareURL=encodeURIComponent(”https:  . archive.   :  . ”); window. interactiveOmniture=window. interactiveOmniture|| ;window. interactiveOmniture[”    ”]= ;       ],”captchaProtected”:false,”questions”:[”options”:[  ],”answerKey”:[”    ”],”createdDate”:1458935376063,”lastUpdated”:1458936182106,”multipleSelectionAmount”:0,”type”:”DEFAULT”}],”allowDuplicate”:false,”lastUpdatedTimestamp”:1458936182105}}  ! 0;   var poll=JSON. parse( document. getElementById(”    ”). innerHTML); var viewType=”embed”;    User Poll Results:      Voting is closed on this poll     Should D.

"If Trump loses, the news media should break the addiction. But can they?.  In the final pages of Richard Ben Cramer’s seminal book about presidential politics, “What It Takes,” Michael Dukakis looks around in wonderment at the scene outside his Massachusetts home less than 24 hours after his crushing 1988 loss to George H. W. Bush. “The barricades were gone. And the agents. And the cop cars, the van, the people  —   that block had been    demonstrations,” Cramer wrote. No TV trucks, photographers, microphones. The only sound: birds. “Nobody,” Dukakis says with relief to top aide John Sasso. And Sasso smiles and agrees: “Yeah. ” It’s what happens to losing presidential candidates: Mitt Romney, Al Gore, the elder Bush himself in 1992, after his loss to Bill Clinton. The blazing spotlight moves away. It’s over. That welcome relief from the madness, though, seems almost an impossibility if Donald Trump loses on Nov. 8. Trump won’t want it to happen, and I’m afraid that media will be equally reluctant to let go. American news organizations may complain of Trump Fatigue. But whether or not we’ll admit it, we have a far worse condition: Trump Addiction. Combined with the candidate’s own need for attention, and his skill at keeping all eyes riveted on him, it’s going to be a hard habit to break. “Trump is catnip, especially to the cable news media. He is not going away,” predicted Jane Hall, a former Fox News contributor and now a communications professor at American University. “I doubt that he is going to let go of the adulation. ” And she said, depending on how his supporters react to a loss, continuing coverage could well be valid. “Unfortunately, a lot of forces have been unleashed and they are going to deserve coverage,” Hall said. Dan Roberts, the Washington bureau chief of British news giant the Guardian, sees it differently. “The coverage of Trump himself will collapse. The minute the campaign is over, the value of that coverage drops,” he said. Roberts thinks that there may be some residual Trump coverage, which he characterizes as “schadenfreude about the damage to his business” and “some interest in what he’s doing next. ” Essentially though, Donald Trump will be old news, he said, and won’t be worthy of much attention. “But,” he added, there is a larger subject that does deserve more coverage: “We should continue paying attention to Trumpism,” fueled by the angry and disenfranchised Americans who have put their weight behind the unlikely candidate and his populist message. Roberts makes the point that news organizations largely missed a huge story months ago when they failed to understand what was driving Trump’s support  —   millions of people who were “very unhappy with the status quo. ” BuzzFeed’s political editor, Katherine Miller, says that postelection Trump coverage will depend heavily on what he does. “If he starts a media property, that’s a point of actual news,” she said. If he follows through on his threat to contest the election, that’s a legitimate story, too. But Miller would draw a line: “Every stray comment he makes is no longer interesting. ” And like both Hall and Roberts, she sees a larger story that will deserve continuing attention: “Trump has been divisive, and the divisions aren’t going to go away. ” But, she says, “Trump himself doesn’t seem all that interested in leading an ideological movement. ” She notes, though, that Trump has always found a way to stay in the limelight, something he’s been doing for decades in various ways: “He is undeniably a captivating person and now represents the divide in the country. ” In recent weeks, even as Trump’s chances of winning have flagged, news coverage of him seems to have ramped up. His threats  —   probably empty ones  —   of suing the New York Times and the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct are swamping everything else. Trump coverage continues to overshadow anything involving Hillary Clinton, the woman who is almost certainly about to become president. It seems obsessive, and smacks of codependency. So here’s a modest proposal. If Trump loses on Nov. 8, let’s avert our addicted gaze. Cold turkey may not be advisable, given legitimate   news that may demand attention. As Jane Hall puts it, “there are gradations of coverage. ” But the   attention to Donald Trump’s every outrageous word and deed should come to a screeching halt. The ugly truth is that the   relationship has worked for both, while doing damage to the nation. Adulation for the narcissist. Vast audiences for those who direct the spotlight. Gladys Knight wasn’t thinking about 2016 politics when she sang, “Neither one of us . . . wants to be the first to say goodbye. ” But she might have been.  For the sake of sanity, civility and democracy, somebody needs to show some discipline and break this thing off. I say we go first.  For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.   ",-0.5
"Everything You Need to Know About the 'Avengers: Infinity War' Heroes. How many times did you see Avengers: Infinity War? Once, twice, three times, a-maybe? No matter how many viewings it warranted, chances are there's something you missed—an Easter egg, a character flaw, a long-forgotten scene from a past film. (Did you remember Ayo had a face-off with Black Widow in Captain America: Civil War? We didn't.) Bottom line: There are just too many damn heroes in that movie to keep up with all of them. Welp, now that the movie is coming to home video (download, DVD, Blu-ray, etc.), it's time to brush up before that umpteenth viewing. WIRED asked the Brothers Russo—aka directors Joe and Anthony Russo, the guys behind Infinity War and the last two Captain America films—to break down the importance of each hero in their movie, and what that character's journey is in the latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Gary Johnson’s Aleppo gaffe was bad. But Trump’s consistent ignorance is worse..  LIBERTARIAN PRESIDENTIAL nominee Gary Johnson embarrassed himself Thursday when he was asked about the epicenter of Syria’s civil war and responded, “What is Aleppo?” The moment, on an MSNBC morning program, deserves to become iconic because it encapsulates why Mr. Johnson is not fit to be president. His disregard for U. S. foreign policy and strategic interests is so profound that he did not recognize a reference to Syria’s largest city, which, for several years, has been the site of intense fighting, massive war crimes and an ongoing humanitarian crisis that has, with its tidal wave of refugees, rocked prime U. S. allies in Europe. But let’s be fair to Mr. Johnson: In the context of the 2016 presidential campaign, he’s far from winning the cluelessness contest. Following his gaffe, the former New Mexico governor offered a relatively cogent summary of U. S. support for various Syrian factions. Later, he apologized, saying that he thought “Aleppo” was an acronym. “I feel horrible,” he said to Bloomberg Politics. “I have to get smarter, and that’s just part of the process. ”  It’s refreshing, at least, to hear a national candidate acknowledge error and vow to do better. Contrast that with Donald Trump, who in a televised national security forum Wednesday offered a staggering array of ignorant and mendacious assertions  —   and acknowledged no regrets about any of them. In addition to repeating his false claims to having opposed the U. S. interventions in Iraq and Libya, Mr. Trump defended a tweet saying that military sexual assault was the result of men and women serving together, and he suggested the solution was to “set up a court system within the military” because “right now, the court system practically doesn’t exist. ” Does he really mean to replace the U. S. military justice system?  At least that would be easier than Mr. Trump’s plan to “take the oil” of Iraq: “Just we would leave a certain group behind, and you would take various sections where they have the oil. ” The   imbecility of this idea surely would make even Mr. Johnson wince. Most troubling of all was Mr. Trump’s renewed endorsement for Vladi mir Putin, in spite of the mounting evidence that the Russian government is attempting to directly interfere in the U. S. election campaign. Confronted with a litany of Mr. Putin’s offenses, including the military actions in Ukraine and Syria and the computer hack of the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Trump responded, “Do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?”  —   as if there were equivalent U. S. actions. “He is really very much of a leader,” Mr. Trump said of a man who has overseen the murder of his domestic political opponents and critical journalists, the rigging of elections, a global campaign of disinformation and a foreign policy whose first aim is to increase Russian influence at U. S. expense. Mr. Johnson may not know what Aleppo is. But in the contest between the United States and an autocratic and increasingly belligerent Russia, Mr. Trump appears not to be sure which side he is on.    Read more about this topic:   Daniel W.

"The Wonder-Buoy That May Finally Make Wave Energy Feasible. With all that to-and-fro and ebb-and-flow, the motions of the ocean offer an endless supply of renewable energy. Or they would, if engineers could figure out how to capture that power. Most prototypes for wave-energy converters have been massive and costly, or else they’re torn apart during violent storms at sea. But a Swedish company called CorPower Ocean may finally have a solution. Tests show its new buoy can produce three times as much electricity as the best rival tech, with a far more practical design. For starters, it’s relatively small: Whereas other devices can stretch hundreds of feet across and weigh well over a thousand tons, CorPower’s bobbing red machine is a mere 26 feet in diameter. Yet a single buoy stationed offshore can generate about 250 kilowatts of power—enough to cover the electricity needs of 200 homes. Wave-power farms could contain hundreds or even thousands of them.

"Tesla says no self-driving for Uber drivers. Tesla owners who have been dreaming of putting their cars in   mode  —   and collecting some Uber fares while they sleep  —   are getting a rude awakening. Tesla will not let owners drive for Uber when their car is in   mode, according to language on the company’s design page. “Using a   Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine,” it said, “but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year. ” That Tesla will be rolling out an   ride sharing service in 2017 may have been news to many owners. Although Tesla didn’t elaborate, the disclaimer suggests owners of its electric vehicles will still be able to drive for Uber or Lyft when their car is not in   mode. The Uber ban is a stark reminder that the   technology is owned by Tesla and is simply used by drivers and that the company may look to put limits on the use of its technology. That means when a person buys a Model S he is agreeing to certain terms and limits, according to Extreme Tech, which reported the Uber ban on Friday. Tesla didn’t offer details on how it will enforce the ban, although experts expect a few policing problems given the amount of data exchanged between its cars and the company’s master motherboard. Tesla also announced that its new models have all the hardware necessary for autonomous driving and that the software will be beamed into the vehicles on receiving regulatory approval. “You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation,” founder Elon Musk wrote last July.",1.0
"4 pieces of evidence showing FBI Director James Comey cost Clinton the election.  Donald Trump has called his election a historic landslide, but it was anything but. Only two other presidents have been elected with smaller popular vote margins since records began in 1824. His edge in the Electoral College, while decisive, depends on less than 80, 000 votes across three states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania) out of more than 135 million cast nationwide. It was a very close election.    In a close election, there are a million reasons “why” it was close. Trump’s popularity with   whites. Turnout among the Democratic base. Campaign malpractice in the Midwest. Jill Stein. Millennials. Most are probably true in the sense they could move enough votes. The Clinton campaign, however, has centered its    narrative on the “Comey effect,” along with another outside factor, Russia’s hacking of DNC and Clinton campaign email accounts. The “Comey effect” refers to the impact of FBI Director James Comey’s October 28 letter to the House Judiciary Committee announcing the discovery new emails that appeared pertinent to their closed investigation of Clinton and his subsequent letter on November 6 that absolved Clinton (after millions of votes had already been cast early).    Many people  —   most notably Trump and other Republicans  —   have scoffed at the claim that the letter changed the outcome of the election, suggesting that it’s a convenient excuse for a weak candidate who made some questionable strategic decisions.     But the Comey effect was real, it was big, and it probably cost Clinton the election. Below, we present four pieces of evidence demonstrating that this is the case.    When we began looking at the data, we were skeptical that Comey’s intervention was decisive. Politicos are notoriously prone to attributing election outcomes to gaffes and other oversimplified causes. It was once posited that a single awkward scream cost Howard Dean his shot at winning the Democratic primary, that the Willie Horton ad destroyed Michael Dukakis, and that the notorious “47 percent” video from 2012 caused Mitt Romney’s loss. Research since has debunked the idea that these incidents were decisive factors. In almost every case, the effects of supposed “game changers” tend to be smaller than broader structural factors, including the state of the economy, the popularity of the incumbent and how long a single party has held the White House.  But Comey’s letter is unique for a few reasons. First, it was an intervention by an institution that Americans have largely perceived as nonpartisan. (Indeed, the FBI actively works to foster that image.) Second, the intervention was almost perfectly timed to impact Clinton at the worst time  —   dominating the final week of campaigning as an unusually large number of undecided voters made up their minds. Finally, it aligned perfectly with the narrative pushed by Trump  —    and bolstered by the media’s obsessive coverage of how Clinton handled her State Department email, and the   release of hacked emails  —   that Clinton was somehow fundamentally corrupt.     Understanding what happened in 2016 is crucial to understanding how to move forward, as efforts to reform the Democratic Party will be largely based on the stories the party tells itself about its defeat this time around  —   and those stories will also shape narratives about future presidential contenders.   Exhibit 1: the state polls First is battleground state polling data from the late stages of the campaign. One of the reasons the outcome on November 8 was shocking for so many is Trump notched surprise victories not only in purple Florida and Ohio, but also supposedly stalwart blue states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Looking back at the widely used RealClearPolitics polling averages shows there was actually a lot of variation in the errors across states. As others have pointed out, one key factor affecting the size of errors was the share of voters in a given state who are white without a college degree. Much of what pundits are describing as error, however, might better be described as the “Comey effect. ” States that showed some of the biggest surprises  —   where Trump outperformed polls  —   also tended to be states where there were fewer polls toward the end of the race.     In other words, pollsters didn’t get things wrong so much as fail, in some states, to speak to voters after a decisive event had taken place. RCP underestimated Trump’s margin over Clinton by less than a point (0. 8) on average, in the seven battleground states where five or more polls were conducted between October 28 and Election Day. But in the other seven states, where fewer than five polls were conducted, the polling averages undershot Trump by 2. 7 points.  Take Wisconsin, where Trump beat his polling average by more than 7 points: only two of the polls included in the final RCP average were conducted entirely after Comey’s letter was published.             To be sure, the gap with Clinton was narrowing before Comey dropped his bombshell, but the pace also picked up significantly after that. For example, averaging across 14 battleground states, the race moved 1. 1 points in Trump’s direction in the week following the third and final debate  —   but Trump gained an additional 2. 4 points after October 28. Exhibit 2: the national polls The effect of Comey’s late intervention into the election is also clear in the national polls. As neuroscientist Sam Wang showed, Clinton’s margin over Trump falls dramatically in national polls directly after the Comey letter and never recovers. At the time, statistician Nate Silver noted that the Comey letter coincided with “a swing of about 3 points against her”  —   a massive swing in a tight election. These public polls are supported by internal polling from both campaigns suggesting that Comey was a massive blow to Clinton at a pivotal moment in the election.            It’s worth noting that Comey also made headlines in July, when he testified in Congress about Clinton’s email server and then announced he would not charge her, while at the same time declaring her behavior “extremely careless. ” In the words of Nate Silver, “That period produced about a   swing against Clinton. ” In other words, every time Comey and emails were driving the news cycle, Clinton’s national polling numbers took a significant hit.  Exhibit 3: The early voting numbers compared with the late deciders Early voting numbers are also suggestive of Comey’s impact on the race. Take for example a noncompetitive blue state like Rhode Island, where there was no contest but the presidential race. In 2012, Obama’s margin between absentee and Election Day ballots was similar, and Obama actually performed about 5 points better on Election Day.     In 2016, Clinton pulled in the same margin with absentee voters: 60 percent compared to Obama’s 61 percent. But something rather remarkable happened on Election Day  —   her support collapsed, dropping by a net 13 points. In Florida, Clinton won the early vote 52 to 48, but Trump won the Election Day   vote 56 to 44 percent.  Steve Schale, a Florida political consultant who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign in Florida, found this difference between early vote figures and Election Day ballots even more stark in the swing   Corridor that stretches across central Florida, from Tampa to Daytona Beach. Here, Schale found that Clinton won the early vote with 56. 3 percent of the   vote, but only won 47. 3 percent of the Election Day vote  —   a highly unusual gap suggesting a pretty significant late surge.  These early voting numbers are supported by data on “late deciders”: voters who chose their candidate in the last week tilted strongly towards Trump. And no media event was more important in the late stages of the campaign than Comey’s letter, which suggests that the most plausible explanation for the strong break in   voters was that letter.            Exhibit 4: media coverage of email, email, and more email The Comey effect dominated media coverage in a way few events did during the campaign, other than Trump’s famous “grab ’em by the pussy” Access Hollywood video. During the final days of the election major newspapers “published 100 stories, 46 of which were on the front page, about or mentioning the emails. ” The tone and tenor of coverage shifted markedly against Clinton in the closing week of the campaign.            Coverage of Clinton’s emails eclipsed her policy proposals and ended up being the only story about Clinton that stuck with voters. While 79 percent of registered voters had heard “a lot” about Clinton’s emails, only 23 percent heard “a lot” about Trump’s housing discrimination, 27 percent heard “a lot” about the Donald J. Trump Foundation’s illegal political contribution to the Florida attorney general, and, surprisingly, only 59 percent had heard a “a lot” about the Hollywood Access tape. The word clouds below show, in graphical form, that emails were the central way that most voters understood Clinton:            During the entirety of the general election campaign, June 7 to November 8, Gallup found that Clinton only sustained a “lead” in media coverage, meaning more Americans were hearing about Clinton than Trump, four times. Two were email related: FBI Director Comey’s press conference in late July, in which he called Clinton “extremely careless,” and Comey’s   announcements in late October and early November. (The others occurred during Clinton’s bout with pneumonia and during the party’s convention.)     The Shorenstein Center found that negative coverage of Clinton’s campaign was fueled by allegations of “scandal. ” As the chart below shows, “scandal” coverage toward Clinton peaked in the final week of the campaign, consuming more than a third of her coverage. The timing was perilous.              The upshot: It’s true that there are other possible explanations for a late shift in vote intentions, but thus far there is no alternative explanation of merit. (The cyberhacks were surely important, but their effects would have been felt more steadily throughout the campaign.)  Instead, the evidence is clear, and consistent, regarding the Comey effect. The timing of the shift both at the state and national levels lines up very neatly with the publication of the letter, as does the predominance of the story in the media coverage from the final week of the campaign. With an unusually large number of undecided voters late in the campaign, the letter hugely increased the salience of what was the defining critique of Clinton during the campaign at its most critical moment. The appeal of   narratives about demographics, along with anecdotal evidence of big mistakes by the Clinton campaign in certain key states, makes it easy to point fingers. But looking specifically at the three “Rustbelt” blue states mentioned at the beginning of the article, no unifying picture emerges. Most stories mention Michigan, where Clinton didn’t campaign, rather than Pennsylvania, where she campaigned intensely. Indeed, these three Midwestern states (Wisconsin being the third) provide essentially an    test of different campaign strategies  —   and in each state she came up just short.  We do not intend to exculpate the Clinton campaign  —   in hindsight many decisions were flawed  —   but rather to note that the decisions were not abnormally bad (all campaigns make errors, and Trump’s made far more than others). However, the historic intervention into the election by James Comey means three major things: Use caution when drawing lessons from 2016 Academic research will eventually yield important findings, but there is the potential for Democrats to overcorrect following this historic presidential loss. Introspection is important  —   and while still early, it’s already underway  —   but understanding exactly what led to the loss is foundational to understanding how to move forward. Lessons should draw from a broader pool of data than the results of the extraordinary 2016 election.    Democrats cannot rely exclusively on the presidency Democrats must focus   where the problems are more acute (for instance, failing to run candidates in winnable elections). Because presidential elections are so variable and are so strongly dependent on outside forces, the   fruit for the Democrats is focusing on organization and mobilization  . Something disturbing happened in 2016 Along with the   theft and publication of emails from the Clinton campaign and the DNC, the Comey effect is of a different category than the usual investigative reporting or opposition research that campaigns have to contend with. Comey broke a   norm of not intervening in presidential elections. The fact that his interference alone almost certainly swayed an election is indicative of a broader and disturbing breakdown of political norms. Sean McElwee is a policy analyst at Demos.

"Trump’s pivot is real — he’s more right-wing than ever.  Donald Trump’s long, improbable journey to political power has been marked by a nearly endless procession of fallacious media conceits. The latest of these posits that the apparent downfall of chief strategist Steve Bannon, driven by personality clashes with Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and substantive policy disagreements with National Economic Council chief Gary Cohn, mark the dawn of a new, more “moderate” or “centrist” version of Trumpism.     The truth is closer to the opposite. Bannon himself was no prize pig, and the country is in many ways better off with his influence diminished. But the emerging Trumpism 2. 0 is in most respects more extreme than what it’s left behind.  You can see this in the recent actions and seemingly undiminished stature of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man deemed too racist for a federal judgeship in the   but kosher to serve as the nation’s top cop 30 years later.  Over the course of the past few weeks, Sessions has indicated a desire to roll back civil rights oversight of abusive police departments, stampeded over states’ objections to immigration enforcement raids at courthouses, dropped efforts to improve forensic science, directed federal prosecutors to dedicate a larger share of their resources to deporting immigrants, launched a new crackdown on   guest worker visas, and indicated a desire to bring back   “war on drugs” policies, including a   federal crackdown on marijuana use.     These notions are congruent with   politics. But across his long career in the Senate, Sessions never fused them into the kind of idiosyncratic populist mélange that Trump offered during the campaign. Instead, his harsh authoritarianism simply sat alongside   policies on everything else under the sun. And with Bannon’s star falling, that appears to be the true synthesis Trump is moving toward.     Gary Cohn won’t moderate Trump  Much misunderstanding about the practical trajectory of the Trumpian pivot stems from the fact that Cohn is a registered Democrat. Bannon tried to exploit that fact during his clashes with Cohn, raising the specter of a clutch of “New York Democrats” undermining Trumpism from within.  But Cohn’s actual policy commitments seem much simpler than that. As a top executive at Goldman Sachs, he traditionally donated money to politicians from the New York City area, mostly Democrats. But as Zack Carter writes at The Huffington Post  after the Obama administration enacted the   financial regulation overhaul, Cohn “flipped on a dime in 2009 and exclusively supported Republicans. ”       This is in line with former colleagues’ characterization of Cohn as not someone who had an enormous apparent interest in politics beyond the specific policy needs of Goldman Sachs. In arguments with Bannon, Cohn  —   allied with National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster  —   has pushed for Trump to downplay his protectionist campaign promises and move toward a more traditional GOP stance on free trade. And after the intervention in Syria, Trump has also seemingly ditched Bannon’s   and   views in favor of a move toward a more traditional GOP stance of foreign policy hawkishness.  Trump is getting more orthodox, not more moderate Down the line, Trump’s current policies now point toward orthodox conservatism:   From the   Trump has seemed to favor a return to the days of   regulation on Wall Street.  Betsy DeVos appears to be safely ensconced at the Education Department, pursuing an agenda of   school choice and reducing protections for student loan borrowers. Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency is about to unwind as much of Obama’s regulatory activism on climate change as he can. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney tells CNBC’s John Harwood that he is “working on” convincing Trump that he needs to tackle entitlement reform.  Loose campaign talk about busting up media and telecommunications conglomerates has been supplanted by a standard Republican   Federal Communications Commission.  This is, it should be said, a genuine change of direction from how Trump portrayed himself and was seen during the campaign. Candidate Trump, in part under Bannon’s influence, folded a   approach to immigration and civil rights into a multifaceted populist approach.     His attacks on trade deals and outsourcing echoed rhetoric from most congressional Democrats and lines that Barack Obama used in his two campaigns. His   foreign policy rhetoric carried, at times, whiffs of John Kerry’s old line about how we shouldn’t be opening firehouses in Baghdad while closing them in Boston.  It was never clear exactly what this Trumpian populism was supposed to amount to, but it sincerely discomfited America’s CEO class and drove the unusual dynamics of the 2016 general election  —   with Hillary Clinton largely choosing to accept Trump’s characterization of himself as something fresh and new. She simply argued that it was fresh and new and dangerous, rather than primarily casting Trump as a fraud who would pursue an agenda of enriching his fellow rich businessmen.  The new Trump is a lot safer  —   for some people Some of Trump’s departures from conservative orthodoxy were probably good ideas on the merits. Opening up the United States to trade with China really did prove to be a tougher adjustment than proponents said. And there’s a strong case to be made for   skepticism of concentration in the financial services and telecommunications industries. More broadly, the sense that the economic policies of the American conservative movement were not well serving the concrete interests of the large   segment of its voting base was correct.  On the other hand, while the election results show pretty clearly that most voters don’t care about this, candidate Trump’s apparent willingness to throw overboard an intricate series of alliances constructed and cemented over a period of decades was genuinely alarming.  A more ideologically orthodox Trump is, in many ways, a more reassuring figure on the world stage, one who may be somewhat more likely than an   Trump to get the United States involved in a small war, but who is also dramatically less likely to permanently upend the global order in a potentially cataclysmic way.  For most Americans, it has now ended up looking like they will get roughly the same policy mix we had under George W. Bush.     But Sessions at the Justice Department is a critical exception to that trend. Before Trump, one major trajectory of the   Republican Party was a series of fitful efforts to expand the party’s outreach to people of color. Bush pushed for a comprehensive immigration reform measure, and many of the party’s most prominent leaders on Capitol Hill did the same during the Obama administration. Marco Rubio spoke compassionately about the issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, and there was a bipartisan push for criminal justice reform.  Vox’s Dara Lind warned last November that liberal panic about Trump   scenarios could end up backfiring by, in effect, serving to normalize an assault on America’s marginalized populations. By winning plaudits for this month’s pivot, Trump has brought those fears to fruition.  ",-1.0
"U.S. attorney’s office recommends putting Robert McDonnell on trial again.  Less than three months after the Supreme Court vacated the convictions of former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell, the U. S. attorney’s office that prosecuted the Republican has recommended to Justice Department   that they endeavor to try him again, according to people familiar with the case. The recommendation from the U. S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia does not guarantee that McDonnell will once again have to battle corruption charges in court. The decision ultimately rests with senior officials at the Justice Department, including the deputy attorney general and possibly the attorney general. But it is a significant step that demonstrates how despite a Supreme Court ruling upending McDonnell’s convictions and significantly narrowing what can be considered public corruption, the prosecutors who convinced jurors that he was guilty the first time believe they could do it once more.  [Hillary Clinton and her family’s foundation aren’t likely to get the McDonnell treatment. Here’s why.]  An attorney for McDonnell, a Justice Department spokeswoman and a spokesman for the U. S. attorney’s office all declined to comment. Asked in an interview earlier this week whether she would accept the recommendation of prosecutors who handled the case  —   whatever that might be  —   Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said, “That’s working its way through the process, so I’m not able to give you a comment on that. ” Prosecutors have until Sept. 19 to formally inform the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit what they intend to do and  —   if they are going forward  —   to set a briefing schedule.      Supreme Court unanimously voted to overturn the public corruption conviction of former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell. Here’s what you need to know about the decision. (Monica   Washington Post)   McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in 2014 of public corruption charges after jurors concluded that they lent the power of the governor’s office to Richmond business executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr. in exchange for $177, 000 in loans, vacations and luxury goods. Prosecutors alleged that the McDonnells helped Williams specifically by arranging meetings for him with other state officials and allowing him to host an event at the governor’s mansion to promote a product he was trying to sell. In one case, prosecutors alleged, the governor pulled out a bottle of that supplement, Anatabloc, and told other state officials that it worked for him. Legal analysts have said Maureen McDonnell’s fate is probably tied to that of her husband. Prosecutors alleged that the ultimate aim of the bargain with Williams was to get Anatabloc studied by state researchers or included in the state’s health plan. Neither came to fruition. And although the former governor’s convictions were upheld by a federal appeals court, the Supreme Court decided that was in error. Justice Department officials are probably weighing not only whether a case could be brought again but also whether it should. McDonnell’s first trial spanned five weeks, and it came after months of bitter and   pretrial litigation. Four prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Justice Department’s public integrity section were consumed by it. McDonnell was ultimately sentenced to two years in prison; his wife to a year and a day. And from the case came a unanimous Supreme Court ruling that experts say makes prosecuting politicians on corruption charges substantially more difficult than it was before. It is possible more successful challenges could lead to a further narrowing of corruption laws and hamper other investigations. The Supreme Court’s ruling dealt a critical blow to the case against McDonnell but not an immediately fatal one. The court decided that jurors were wrongly instructed on the meaning of the term “official act”  —   the thing that prosecutors were required to prove McDonnell did or tried to do for Williams in exchange for the businessman’s favors  —   and offered a definition far more narrow than what jurors had considered. For the purposes of a bribery case, an official act “must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote. He said it must be “something specific and focused” and that the public official must make a decision or take an action on it, or at least agree to do so.  “Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event  —   without more  —   does not fit that definition of ‘official act,’ ” Roberts wrote. McDonnell’s defense attorneys had wanted the case to be thrown out wholesale on the grounds that prosecutors had presented insufficient evidence of an official act. But the Supreme Court declined to do that, saying both sides had not had an opportunity to address the question in light of the court’s clarified definition. And the opinion offered a possible way forward. While setting up meetings or calling other government officials could not be official acts by themselves, Roberts wrote, they could serve as evidence of an agreement to perform such an act  —   if, for example, jurors concluded the meeting helped show an official was attempting to pressure or advise another official to do something more. In McDonnell’s case, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit decided that something more would be trying to influence whether researchers at any of Virginia’s state universities would initiate a study of Anatabloc; whether the   Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission would allocate grant money for the study of Anatabloc’s key ingredient; or whether the state health plan would include the product. But, because of the jury instructions, jurors might not have considered those things and wrongly convicted McDonnell because they concluded that he arranged meetings for Williams or contacted other state officials in exchange for Williams’s generosity, Roberts wrote. If the Justice Department allows prosecutors to go forward, they will first have to convince the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that there is enough evidence to proceed  —   which is no guarantee. That decision itself could be appealed to the Supreme Court. And if they ultimately go to another trial, prosecutors would have to recalibrate how they present their case, focusing less on the meetings and events themselves than on how they show that Williams and McDonnell had broader plans. That will not be easy. Roberts noted in the opinion that several McDonnell subordinates had testified at trial that the governor “asked them to attend a meeting, not that he expected them to do anything other than that. ” “If that testimony reflects what Governor McDonnell agreed to do at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from Williams, then he did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the three questions or matters described by the Fourth Circuit,” Roberts wrote. But he noted that jurors “may have disbelieved that testimony or found other evidence that Governor McDonnell agreed to exert pressure on those officials to initiate the research studies or add Anatabloc to the state health plan. ”  Rachel Weiner and Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report.  Read more:   McDonnell’s case might help others accused of corruption   Officials: Federal prosecutors investigating Virginia Gov. McAuliffe  ",-0.5
"Cop blames backyard masturbation on ‘tough times’. An NYPD detective who copped to being a serial pervert,   received a   ticket and was released from custody Monday, authorities said. The police commissioner of Rockville Centre, LI, where disgraced Detective Robert Francis was allegedly caught in the act Sunday, defended officials’ decision not to keep the cop in custody, saying he was in no way given “special treatment” because he’s an officer. “We only charged him with misdemeanors,” Police Commissioner Charles Gennario said. “That’s all we could charge him with. He was not a danger in that sense that he was now known to us. ” Francis, 46, was busted around 2:30 a. m. Sunday when he was caught standing in the driveway of a Rockville Centre home with a flashlight, authorities said. Officials say he would shine a flashlight into bedroom windows to get the attention of his female victims, then begin masturbating when they looked outside. The Queens cop, who has been suspended from the NYPD, was charged with four incidents of public lewdness dating back to Feb. 5. Three of his female victims were under the age of 16, Gennario said. “He would drive into town,” he said. “He would leave his vehicle blocks from where he was going to victimize people. ” The commish insisted that Francis’ victims “were chosen at random. It was a coincidence that they were young girls. ” When Francis was arrested Sunday, he admitted to the earlier incidents and showed “remorse,” Gennario said. “He kept telling the investigating detective that he was going through tough times,” the commissioner said. “I spoke to my detective just before we came in here, and he was concerned that he might harm himself. ” Francis was also charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child and trespassing.",1.0
"4 Robot Vacuum Tips That Will Help You Keep a Tidy Home. It wasn’t long ago that robot vacuums were something of a joke, more a statement of affluence or potential cat car than a convenient household tool. However, both the hardware and software have improved enormously in the past few years. Innovations like smart maps and self-emptying dust bins have made robovacs more useful and more ubiquitous than ever before. Along with Velcro and routers, I count a good robot vacuum as one of my favorite inventions of the past half-century—we've rounded our top picks in our best robot vacuums guide. But even if the tech has dramatically improved, it doesn’t mean they’re always easy to use. If you're worried you're at risk of becoming the next Roomba “pooptastrophe”, read on. There are a few ways that we can help. It’s tempting, but you can’t open the box, start your new robot vacuum, walk away for three hours, and expect to come home to a clean house. It takes time for both you and the robovac to learn what the potential booby traps in your house will be for the roving machine. I always stay home for the first run (or three) to make sure the robot can complete a cleaning run. It also helps to give your house a once-over before you start any cleaning. Dangling shoelaces, fringed toddler skirts, and ribbons tend to trip up the smartest robot vacuum. In my testing, I’ve found that iRobot’s 900 and I Series, like the Roomba 980 and the Roomba i7+, do the best job of skirting potential traps. Robot vacuums use a number of different sensors to navigate around your home. Bumper sensors tell them when it’s run into something and to head off in a different direction. Infrared cliff sensors on the edges alert robovacs to when they about to fall off a step. Many smart robot vacuums don’t have cameras (don’t get a robot vacuum with a camera!), but they do have optical sensors that track obstacles in the robot’s path and measure how far it’s traveled. Unfortunately, optical sensors require ambient light to operate. If you find that your vacuum is getting stuck often, don't schedule your cleanings at night. Try 9 AM, just after you leave for work. If you have a dog, cleaning right after you leave will also give your pup less time to have an accident on the floor. If your robot is still having trouble navigating, you can also try wiping off the optical sensors with a soft cloth. A few people have complained to me that instead of cleaning, their robot vacuum drags dirt around their house. Unfortunately, a robot vacuum’s dust bin is pretty small. Most robot vacuums have a bin size of around 0.6 liters. The dust bin on my Dyson ball vacuum is twice that, and I still need to empty it from room to room. If you live in a house with multiple small children or pets, your robot vacuum might be regurgitating dirt as it cleans. I usually do a deep clean every week or so with a push vacuum to ease its burden, or you might want to schedule a cleaning for when you’re at home and can empty the bin. It also helps to regularly clean the vacuum's roller brush. You can also spring for a robot vacuum with its own self-cleaning base. Ideally, you would automate your robot vacuum's cleaning cycles, not give it another thought, and come home to a clean house every day thereafter. But you will also have to give your house a quick once-over regularly to keep stray pieces of dental floss out of your vacuum's way. Some friends have told me they appreciate the regular reminders to pick up after themselves. However, I have also created what I call “throw zones.” If you don’t have time to put everything away every time you run your robot vacuum, you can designate an area to toss the toy necklaces and blankies to go before you leave the house. For smart robot vacuums, you can now usually draw a boundary line in your app, but for dumber ones, you can stick a magnetic boundary strip at the areas in your house you want to cordon off. Before the cleaning run starts, toss every iffy household item behind the boundary. Ideally, you would then sort out everything that has landed in your own personal Bermuda Triangle, but you can get to that later. With two kids, a dog, and a full-time job, I credit robot vacuums with being one of the few devices that helps keep my house in a semi-presentable condition. And unlike a push vacuum, it regularly cleans places that I might otherwise overlook, like under the couch, oven, or beds. Soon, you too may find that your robot vacuum has also become one of your best friends. At the very least, it still makes a fine tool for rolling the littlest of your cute critters around the living room.

"Motorola’s sweet government contracts are at risk: investor. Andrew Left has found yet another company whose stock he thinks will get walloped by President Trump. The activist   behind Citron Research attacked Motorola Solutions in a report Tuesday, saying that the company’s profits are mostly derived from selling overpriced handsets to emergency first responders in the US. Citing Trump’s campaign promise to go out to bid “virtually every facet of our government,” Left believes that the days of Motorola’s   status with US first responders may be coming to an end. As evidence of Motorola’s   in the US, Left said that Motorola’s prices in the European Union are a fifth of what they are domestically. With a mix of government scrutiny and increased competition, Motorola’s profits could fall by nearly 40 percent and its stock, which had been trading around $82, could fall to $45, Left said. Motorola refuted Left’s claims in a statement Tuesday. “Citron has made numerous false and misleading statements and we strongly disagree with the assertions made by this ” Motorola said. The company maintained that it has been successful in getting government contracts in a “robust competitive bidding processes” because its products are the “most reliable. ” Shares fell more than 5 percent in intraday trading, touching below $77. Left recently attacked   manager Express Scripts and aerospace company Transdigm as other firms that could be hurt by Trump’s policies.",1.0
"‘Don’t Breathe’ is a near-perfect thriller. In “Don’t Breathe,” when three cocky millennial burglars break into a house to rob an elderly, blind Persian Gulf War vet, it really isn’t a fair fight. Really, what chance do they have? A sinewy little    thriller directed with   gusto by Fede Alvarez, “Don’t Breathe” takes place mostly inside the house of the aging veteran (a terrifying Stephen Lang) who has also lost a daughter to an errant driver and apparently spends his nights listening to tapes of the little girl as he laments his woes. In his safe there are hundreds of thousands of dollars, a court settlement known to Alex, the son (Dylan Minnette) of the man who installed the blind man’s alarm system. Alex and his partners Rocky (Jane Levy) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) expect an easy heist, and have brought along sleeping gas to knock out the old man, as well as tranquilizers for the guy’s    Rottweiler. So it’s stroll in, clean out the safe with the aid of insider knowledge about security systems and be home in time for Jimmy Fallon, right? Not quite. Set in a ravaged and broken Detroit  —   a vast cemetery for housing  —   the film turns the Blind Man (as he is called in credits) into a vengeful and nearly wordless Cyclops, whose keenly tuned senses of hearing and smell are all he needs to locate and attack the intruders, one by one. Moreover, the younglings quickly discover that breaking into the house is simpler than breaking out due to the Blind Man’s elaborate system of locks and bolts. And he, unlike they, is exceedingly  . Garden tools will be deployed, and not for weeding. Alex and Rocky are mildly sympathetic, especially given her story of how a ladybug once provided her with her only hope when Daddy used to lock her in the trunk. But for nearly half of this tight, intense claustrophobia trip Alvarez doesn’t clarify whose side we should be on, adding another layer of suspense to an already   story. Individual scenes such as Alex lying helplessly on a cracking   window, or a bit that simulates total darkness with a woozy gray look, are handled brilliantly, while Lang plays his part to the hilt. The old man may be blind, but he ain’t dumb. Apart from its thin characters and occasional trite moments, as well as a silly attempt to set up a sequel, “Don’t Breathe” is just about perfect. It’s as lean and relentless as the best John Carpenter films.",1.0
"How a Store of Rhino Semen Could Save the Species. This story originally appeared on the Guardian and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. For over 20 years, Thomas Hildebrandt has harbored a dream: to save the northern white rhinoceros, the world’s rarest large mammal. On Monday the scientist received the devastating news that Sudan, the last male of the species, had been put down in his northern Kenyan home, aged 45. Hildebrandt’s office is full of pictures of him, on which he points out the species’ unique pearl-like skin, furry ears, huge feet for tackling swamps, and horns capable of lifting two tons. “We were extremely sad,” Hildebrandt said. “He was old and very sick, and we knew the day would come, but I’d known him for 18 years and he was the gentlest of creatures who had become an important ambassador for species protection,” he said. Hildebrandt has short videos of Sudan in his final weeks of life that the rhino’s carers in Ol Pejeta conservancy sent him so that he could follow his decline – he gradually stopped eating and walking, whereupon the decision was made to put him down. Sudan did not live to see another northern white rhino being born, despite efforts to mate him in Kenya with southern white rhinos to at least produce a hybrid. But Hildebrandt said he is very hopeful that the last two remaining members of his species, Fatu and Najin, his 28-year-old daughter and 18-year-old granddaughter, will. Prof Hildebrandt is head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the eastern suburbs of Berlin. He holds the keys to rescuing the species, discovered in Belgian Congo by the British geologist Richard Lydekker in 1908, when there were hundreds of thousands of the animals, before it was hunted to virtual extinction for its valuable horn. Unlocking the door of a nondescript concrete block at the institute this week, Hildebrandt showed off a cryogenic tank in which 300ml of northern white rhino semen is stored in liquid nitrogen at -196C. Hildebrandt has been collecting the samples with colleagues for about 15 years. He couldn’t expose the samples, “because it’s just too delicate,” he said, “it’s truly priceless. Part of the world’s cultural heritage.” The tank sits next to many others in the high-security complex—a potential treasure trove of samples including semen of the cancer-resistant naked mole rat, disease materials, tumours and microbes—that could provide the answer to some of the world’s diseases. Following the death of Sudan, the rhinos are uppermost in his mind. In what he calls a race against time, he plans to deploy IVF techniques and fly to Kenya to collect eggs from the ageing females, Fatu and Najin, in May or June via a method called ovum pick-up. The incubated eggs will be flown from Ol Pejeta via Nairobi to Zurich and then onto Cremona in Italy where Cesare Galli, who specialises in assisted reproduction of large animals, will mature and fertilise them and develop embryos suitable for transfer. They will then be implanted in southern white rhino surrogates – neither Fatu nor Najin are able to carry calves themselves – in the hope they will carry them to full term. “It’s very foreseeable in the near future that we’ll have offspring,” Hildebrandt said. Even if Hildebrandt and his team manage to produce a lot of offspring from the two females using IVF with the frozen semen they have, they will be unable to achieve the necessary biological variety to create a long-term sustainable population, he said. Which is where stem cell research is crucial. Within the next three to five years the institute should be able to use skin cell samples taken in 2014 from Sudan and other northern white rhinos, add genes to them in order to turn them into stem-cells, and encourage them to become eggs. These would be fertilised with the sperm samples stored by Hildebrandt to create test-tube rhinos which southern white rhino surrogates would, it is hoped, carry to term, producing genetically-variable offspring. The brains behind the stem cell technology are those of Katsuhiko Hayashi who in 2016 made headlines after he successfully used mice stem cells to grow eggs which produced healthy offspring. “This technology will provides us with the missing link,” Hildebrandt said. When asked why it matters, and is there not an argument for seeing extinction as part of evolution, Hildebrandt becomes irate. “It is very arrogant to ask why this is important,” he said. “We humans kill a species in its very fragile habitat, and then ask: ‘why is it important to rescue it?’ This animal is at the end of a complex biological system. Its faeces provides food for thousands of insects, its skin living space for ox picker birds, the branches it breaks down through walking through the jungle provides food for antelopes and produces pathways to escape from leopards. It is like a landscape architect on which many species are dependent. “We learnt a bit about disturbed ecosystems through the ebola and AIDS crises. We don’t know what the long-term effect on the ecosystem might be, but we definitely disturb it by removing such an animal.” Given its potential for success and the way it has captured the public imagination after Sudan’s death, it is a surprise to discover that the rhino preservation project is something most of the scientists involved are mainly doing in their spare time. “Everything would have been a little faster had we had solid financing,” Hildebrandt said. “We’re not running out of money, the truth is we never had any money for this.” The institute is trying to use the momentum created by Sudan’s death to galvanise support. “A ten-year-old girl donated the €100 from her piggy bank towards our work this week. So kids really recognise the importance of this, even if politicians don’t,” Hildebrandt said. “After all, if this works, it could have a huge impact as a role model for other extinct or near-extinct species.” At the end of April Hildebrandt will travel to Borneo to try a similar strategy to save the Sumatran rhino of which there are as few as 30 left.",0.0
"If you think education is the solution to income inequality, you may have flunked Statistics.        The big topic that the big discussions love to talk around is wealth inequality. We are like the alcoholic that doesn’t want to admit we have a problem. First it was ‘There isn’t sufficient evidence of growing inequality.’ Then it was ’Maybe it doesn’t matter as long as everyone is benefitting.’ Then it was ‘Maybe it matters to individuals, but it won’t have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.’ Then it was ‘Maybe it will affect the economy, but our political system can handle it.’ Then it was “There’s nothing we can do collectively, so get more education and you’ll be fine individually.’ The ‘more education’ solution always begged a couple of questions. Does it really do anything about inequality or does it just rearrange the individuals within the inequality. The other question is whether education even works at all in this equation. More education, of course, is a good in itself. More information in your head and more skills are going to benefit you and likely the nation as well in global completion. But now it’s time for the ‘That being said  …    ’ That being said, education may not be any answer at all to wealth inequality, and there is some new evidence on that topic. If you’ve borrowed a lot of money to improve your place in the economic distribution, and that didn’t pay off, then what? Then we are back to the question we’ve been avoiding all this time: our current policy of facilitating wealth inequality through our tax system. Our tax code used to be more progressive, and we had less wealth disparity. It’s not rocket science, it’s a policy choice. When we had higher marginal tax rates, there was less reason to jack up the high end of income. Now there is all the reason in the world.  “We have minimum wages, but there isn’t a wage ceiling,” an author of the report said. “There’s much more room for discrimination and inequality at the top. What’s happened is that the top one percent have really pulled away. ” Surprised? No, predictable. Maybe we need to rebalance our economy to be more, um  …     balanced.",-0.5
"Taliban splinter group claims attack on Christians at Pakistan park; 60 dead.   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   A suicide blast claimed by Islamist militants ripped through crowds of families celebrating Easter at a park in the city of Lahore on Sunday, killing at least 60 people and injuring an additional 300 in an attack the jihadists said had deliberately targeted Christians. The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber in the parking lot of Gulshan   Park at about 6:30 in the evening, transforming a joyful scene of picnicking families into a spectacle of chaos and horror. Many children were among the dead, local officials said. A spokesman for the Jamaat   militant group, which is an offshoot of the Pakistani Taliban, asserted responsibility in a telephone interview Sunday. “It was our people who attacked the Christians in Lahore, celebrating Easter,” the spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, said. “It’s our message to the government that we will carry out such attacks again until sharia [Islamic law] is imposed in the country. ” Pakistan, a country of 190 million, has suffered for years from sectarian violence and Islamist militancy, including a   insurgency in the tribal areas on the border with Afghanistan. Christians make up about 1 percent of Pakistan’s population but have maintained a larger presence in Lahore.   In Lahore, Parveen Masih, a    Christian woman, said she had gone to the park with her husband and kids to celebrate Easter. They were there when the bomb exploded.  “This attack was about nothing other than to sabotage our happiness,” Masih, who was wounded in the face, said in a telephone interview. “We had only a few days to celebrate, and they didn’t even let us enjoy those. ” The government of Punjab province  —   where the attack occurred, and which is Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s political stronghold  —   announced three days of mourning. A statement from the office of Punjab’s chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, who is the prime minister’s brother, pledged that the culprits would be brought to trial. “Those who targeted innocent citizens do not deserve to be called humans,” Shahbaz Sharif posted on his Twitter account. “We will hunt you down,” he said. And “make sure your terror infrastructure is dismantled completely. ” Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, met with his security advisers after the attack, and they reached “key decisions” on how to respond, a statement from his office said. Ehsan, the Jamaat   spokesman, declared that the militants would strike again in Punjab. The group broke away from the Pakistani Taliban, or    in 2014, as a result of infighting between top commanders. Jamaat   rejoined the Taliban in March 2015, but it still maintains its own faction within the group. The top security official in the province, Haider Ashraf, said an initial forensic investigation into the attack concluded that the suicide bomber had packed more than 20 pounds of explosives in his vest. Ball bearings, typically used in bomb attacks to maximize casualties, were found at the scene, Ashraf said.      “We can say it was a suicide blast, in which most of the Christian families and Muslim families who went to    park to enjoy the holiday were targeted,” he said, adding that the attacker detonated his explosives near an area marked off for women. Witnesses to the carnage described body parts scattered in the wake of the attack, Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper reported. Images on social media showed panic and chaos in the moments after the blast and medics ferrying the wounded away on stretchers. In one case, four members of a single family were killed, a medic said. The only survivor was a    boy, who was also injured. “I was about to enter the park with my kids” when the explosion happened, said Anwar Ali, a resident of Lahore. “My kids started crying, and I held them tightly when I saw the wounded. ” In a statement on Sunday, the State Department said that the United States “stands with the people and government of Pakistan at this difficult hour. ”  “Attacks like these only deepen our shared resolve to defeat terrorism around the world,” the statement said.  The government of Punjab announced on its Twitter account that it was offering free rides to those who wished to donate blood to the victims. In Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital, the army was deployed on Sunday to the “Red Zone” area of the city to help quell unrest following a violent protest march by Muslims. Thousands of demonstrators turned out to denounce the execution last month of Mumtaz Qadri, who assassinated the former Punjab governor, Salmaan Taseer, in 2011. Taseer had spoken out against Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Police could not halt the demonstrators, who rampaged across central Islamabad, setting buildings on fire Sunday. The Red Zone area of the capital houses a number of vital government institutions, including parliament and the prime minister’s house.

"Imagine if Mitt Romney were president amid this economic news.  The unemployment rate is 4. 9 percent. Consumer sentiment is back at its 1996 level. The Census Bureau says median incomes jumped by more in 2015 than in any year on record. Poverty is down. Inequality is declining. Health insurance coverage is up. We are far, far outpacing our peer nations.     But I can feel myself trying to write it. The    paragraph. The  ’  paragraph. Male labor force participation remains low.   median household incomes are below their 1999 peak. Plenty of people have been left behind by this recovery.  I’ve been struggling with this since the Census Bureau’s report came out. Is it time to say what few have dared say since 2008? Is it time to say that the economy is actually in pretty good shape  —   that the crisis, and even the “” is over? Is my reluctance to do so based on an analysis of the economy or a negativity bias that’s begun to cloud my vision? Here’s a thought experiment. What if Mitt Romney had won in 2012? What if it was his economy that was seeing sub —  5 percent unemployment, falling poverty, and the largest median wage gains since the Census Bureau began keeping records?     There would be parades in the streets. President Romney would be hailed as the second coming of Ronald Reagan  —   or maybe even better! Progressivism would be discredited. The fundamental wisdom of conservatism would be affirmed.     Remember, Romney merely promised he would cut unemployment below 6 percentage points by the end of his first term. ”I can tell you that over a period of four years, by virtue of the policies that we’d put in place, we’d get the unemployment rate down to six percent, and perhaps a little lower,” he told Time during the campaign. Reality, as we are living in it, has outpaced even his campaign promises.     This would, of course, be nonsense  —   the president doesn’t control the economy, even if he or she is ultimately held responsible for its gyrations. But pointing out that it’s nonsense would, I am quite sure, seem churlish after the Romney administration mailed a bottle of champagne to every household in America. Romney would have promised to heal the economy, and he would have made good on that promise. In today’s environment, however, roughly the opposite is happening. Donald Trump’s rise is so remarkable that it requires explanation. One of the main explanations offered is that his run is powered by “economic anxiety. ” That’s led to a more negative economic outlook among the chattering class. Trump’s success proves that Americans are suffering under a weak economy; all that’s left is to assemble the data points and anecdotes that prove the narrative. Which is all to say that we refract our economic analysis through the lens of politics and policy  —   particularly, though not only, in election years.     Then there’s journalism’s own negativity bias. Few get into economic journalism to simply describe the state of the economy on any given day. Most of us attracted to the field are there to draw attention to the plight of the poor, to the wrongdoing of banks, to the groups left behind. If you tend to focus on the bright side of the American economy  —   or even on the averages  —   you’re probably not going to spend your life covering it. Worse, it feels callous to be a   journalist, sitting in a major urban center, telling people things are great. The averages might look cheery, but millions are left out of even the best economy. Few readers send angry emails when you focus on what’s wrong with the recovery. Plenty send angry emails  —   and the charges sting  —   when you focus on what’s right with it. But I keep thinking about the Romney counterfactual. If this economy weren’t entangled in the narratives of Obama’s slow recovery and Trump’s rise, would we be celebrating it? I think we would be. Would we be right to celebrate it? I think so. It isn’t perfect  —   no economy is  —   but it’s a lot better than anyone expected four years ago.  ",-1.0
"Phil Jackson’s Lakers gloat: I warned you about Porzingis. Knicks president Phil Jackson claims he warned the Lakers they’d be sorry if they passed on Kristaps Porzingis at No. 2 in last June’s draft. The Lakers instead selected point guard D’Angelo Russell, who had an    rookie year. The    Porzingis fell to the Knicks at No. 4 and finished   in the Rookie of the Year voting. In excerpts obtained from MSG Network from its special airing Wednesday night on the Jeff Hornacek hiring, Jackson said: “We knew that [Porzingis] had a lot of talent. We saw that even in the workout with him shooting, and I had some fun with one of the Buss guys and I told him after [our] workout, ‘You guys are going to be sorry if you don’t pick up Porzingis with the second pick.’ They didn’t, we did. ” Jackson’s remark was a shot back at the Lakers, whose   Byron Scott said last month   in his L. A. workout. Jackson’s fiancée is Lakers president Jeanie Buss, whose older brother Jimmy Buss is the team’s vice president of basketball operations. “Watching him in the summer league, we thought he was really competitive, that’s what we wanted to see in the  tapes study we did,’’ Jackson added. “But when we saw that he had the stamina to play 28 to 32 minutes, well, we thought maybe he was going to be a     guy because of his strength and his lack of size or weight. But we knew how competitive, and what an athletic talent he was, really to be able to have that stamina. ’’ In the MSG Network special, Jackson went on to say there will be “no boundaries’’ between him and Hornacek in terms of giving his input. Jackson admitted that in Derek Fisher’s rookie year, he stepped back, hoping Fisher would rely on his experienced assistant coaches such as Kurt Rambis and Jim Cleamons. Fisher got fired in February, according to a source, for not communicating well with Jackson. “One of the things that distinguished the relationship that I had with Derek is that perhaps I anticipated that the support staff that he had with him was going to be really influential in his learning experience, and [I was] trying to stay away from him because there was so much attention about he was one of my former players and he hadn’t been a coach,’’ Jackson said. “So my input was limited. Last year I started having more input in the relationship.   …     That’s the thing that I really think makes sense for good organizations  —   is that there are no boundaries between the coach, general manager, and president. “If someone’s got something to contribute, then we want to hear it, we want to bring it up. We’ve got a video guy that’s coming to us and saying, ‘You gotta look at this’  —   this is what we think is important, it should happen. We want to have an open opportunity for them to express that. So those are things that are really important. ” Ironically, Jackson set boundaries when he was coach of the Bulls and Lakers, getting into wars with GMs Jerry Krause and Jerry West, respectively. MSG Network’s special is called “Jeff Hornacek: A Knicks Beginning” and airs at 6:30 p. m. Jackson, Hornacek and general manager Steve Mills give their insights into the shocking hiring.",1.0
"Hearst Autos is the car mashup you’ve been waiting for. Hearst is combining its Jumpstart auto Web site and its two big auto buff books, Car and Driver and Road & Track, with an   database and rolling it all up into a new unit to be called Hearst Autos. Normally, that kind of sweeping consolidation is the   for a new round of cutbacks, but Hearst Magazines President David Carey said not so this time. “This is a buildup in every way,” according to Carey, who said the company opened a new tech engineering site in Atlanta and added editorial staff in Ann Arbor, Mich. where the car titles are based. “We’ve probably added 20 people to this group in the past few months,” said Carey. Veteran   executive Nick Matarazzo, who has been running Jumpstart for the past five years, now moves up to head of Hearst Auto. In addition, Hearst Auto will take the    data site, Veretech Holdings, aimed at auto dealers, and move it under the consumer magazines division. “We’ll be able to connect the consumers who are shopping for cars with the dealers who sell them,” said Carey.",1.0
"This 13-year-old tried to buy porn, lottery tickets, and a gun. Guess which one he got..  In the wake of the 49 murders at Orlando’s gay nightclub Pulse, there’s been a conversation on gun control in this country, or the lack of it.    The ease of getting a gun in America is, at this point, terrifyingly entertaining. In the wake of Orlando’s shooting massacre, a columnist in Philadelphia purchased an   semiautomatic rifle, the gun used in some of America’s deadliest mass shootings. She was able to buy it in seven minutes. Another writer, in Vermont, purchased the same gun model from a man in a Five Guys parking lot. HuffPo bought one in Orlando, the site of the mass shooting, in a little over 38 minutes. According to Fox Business,   are flying off the shelves. (The gun used in the Orlando shooting was  a Sig Sauer MCX, which is similar to the  .) But the best summation of the sad hilarity of this all might go to a segment from HBO’s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. In 2014, the show outfitted a    boy with a hidden camera and had him try to buy things he wasn’t allowed to.    It was easier for a    boy from Virginia to purchase a gun, a . 22 caliber rifle, from a private seller at a gun show than it was for him to buy porn, cigarettes, beer, and lottery tickets. (According to Virginia State Police, you must be 18 years of age to purchase a rifle or shotgun from a licensed firearms dealer.) It’s so real and shocking that it’s almost feels like satire or parody. On Wednesday, members of the Senate, predominantly Democrats, held a   filibuster to change the way we sell guns in this country. That filibuster has prompted a vote.       18 charts that explain gun violence in America    ",-1.0
"Team Trump risks big trouble with unforced errors. Remember the ’62 Mets? Marvelous Marv Thornberry and   Coleman? Then maybe you’ll remember manager Casey Stengel’s lament, “Can’t anyone here play this game?” Donald Trump’s supporters might at times have felt that way, over the last couple of days. Nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court was a home run, but it didn’t erase the unforced errors of the last week, in the new administration’s headlong rush to gets things done pronto. Sadly, that has sacrificed the reputation of political wizardry the administration had acquired over the course of an extraordinary campaign. All of a sudden, the people who had outsmarted all the other Republican candidates, and then in the general election had made all the pollsters and the pundits look like idiots, were found to be all too fallible. Once that happens, it’s hard to get it back. Much of the turmoil in the Middle East can be blamed on 20 years of disastrous American wars, and I think it’s churlish to ban people who’ve helped us in the region, at the risk of their lives, from entering our country. And I don’t trust bureaucrats to get things right with waivers. Quite apart from that, Trump supporters who agreed with the substance of the immigration executive order might have wondered whether it was smart to issue it before the attorney general was confirmed. That was an accident waiting to happen. And just what was gained by roping in dual citizens? I’ll tell you what was lost. Countries are bound to protect their own citizens, and our allies woke up wondering just what was up with the Yanks. As for not wanting to meet Prince Charles: Sure, he talks to plants. But has it possibly occurred to anyone that he just might have to be the host of a British state dinner next summer? As it is, word has it that Queen Elizabeth is trying to get out of the dinner. And if it’s not Britain (or Russia) just which foreign country do you think the president might safely visit? Trump’s statement about the Holocaust omitted any mention of the murder of Jews, which must have warmed the hearts of Holocaust deniers everywhere. That was uncharacteristic and stupid, and then Reince Priebus doubled down on the stupidity. “I mean, everyone’s suffering in the Holocaust,” he babbled. Righto, but that’s the kind of moral blindness that   progressives spout. It’s inconvenient to mention the specifically Jewish nature of the Holocaust if you want to undermine the Jewish state of Israel. One other thing. The administration has tossed out the idea that Mexico’s   taxes (or VATs) give America an excuse to impose a countervailing tariff on goods imported from Mexico. But that’s wrong. Mexican VATs aren’t like a tariff that makes it cheaper for Mexicans to buy   goods than   ones. That might reasonably invite US retaliation in the form of a tariff on   goods. Here’s how it works: Suppose Mexico imposes a   VAT tax on the sale of $100 widgets. The Mexican consumer will pay $120 for it, and so will the American consumer who buys it in Mexico. But when the American returns home he can get the $20 back from the Mexican government. No such tax is imposed in the United States. The Mexican who buys it here will pay $100 for it, but when he returns home he’ll be asked to pay a duty of 20 percent. In short, Mexican and American residents pay the same price for the widget, wherever they buy it, so there’s no subsidy for Mexican manufacturers and no justification for a US tariff on   goods. So how serious is this? It’s not a crime. But then recall what Talleyrand said about Napoleon’s execution of the Duc d’Enghien. “It’s worse than a crime. It’s an error. ” The error has energized Senate Democrats to oppose Cabinet nominees. They’d have done so in any event, but not as much as they’re going to now, and it’s probably going to be necessary to blow up the Senate filibuster very shortly. With a narrow Republican margin in the upper house, the administration is going to have to start listening more closely to some Senate Republicans it doesn’t much like. That may not be a bad thing. There are some very smart people in the White House these days. The question is whether they’re smart enough to realize they’re not as smart as they thought they were, and that they might profitably seek advice from some of the people who’ve been cut out of their decisions.",1.0
"Guess How Much That Anti-LGBTQ Law Is Costing North Carolina. In March, North Carolina state legislators banned transgender people from peeing in the bathroom of their choosing. According to the law, HB2 or the ""bathroom bill,"" when you're in public building—a government agency, a public school, whatever—the gender listed on your birth certificate is the only one that matters. You remember the initial hubbub: North Carolina and the federal government suing each other, the boycotts and the hashtags and the Bruce Springsteen concerts cancelled. In spite of that, North Carolina's government hasn't repealed the law, and this week, the state lost high-profile sporting events, too, as the ACC and the NCAA pulled their championship games out of the state in protest. (If the NCAA is looking at you sideways, you know you're doing something shady.) But we're not here to talk about how the bill is bad and discriminatory. The DOJ made that call months ago.

"Melania Trump hopes voters will accept her husband’s apology for his ‘unacceptable and offensive’ comments about women.      Donald Trump’s wife, Melania, issued a statement on Saturday condemning comments that her husband made about women in 2005 but said she hoped that voters would accept the apology he made overnight. “The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,” Melania Trump said in a statement circulated by the campaign. “This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. ” The Washington Post on Friday reported that,  during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women. At one point during the conversation, Trump says that “when you’re a star, they let you do it. ” A recording of the conversation was obtained by The Washington Post. It appears to have been recorded around Sept. 16, 2005, several months after he married Melania Trump, his third wife.   [The mystery of Melania Trump]   Late Friday night, following sharp criticism by Republican leaders, Trump issued a short video statement saying, “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize. ” But he also called the revelation “a distraction from the issues we are facing today. ” He said that his “foolish” words are much different from the words and actions of Bill Clinton, whom he accused of abusing women, and Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of having “bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. ”",-0.5
"7 sailors died on board the USS Fitzgerald. Here are their stories..      First came the crash, then the rushing waters  —   and then, the wave of grief. The grief swelled after divers found seven bodies in the wreckage of the USS Fitzgerald off the coast of Japan this weekend. It washed across the United States, through dire phone calls, texts and solemn visits. It reached the family of a    firefighter who had enlisted in the Navy the year before, and the wife of a   veteran who had been planning his retirement, and fell upon households from Connecticut to the southern end of Texas  —   people with little more in common than a sudden, immense loss on the other side of the world. A Navy chaplain brought the news to Halethorpe, Md. where Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Martin had lived. On Father’s Day, Martin’s bereaved father stood in front of a CBS WJZ news crew and covered his mouth with his hand. “He’s my only child,” Darrold Martin said. “He’s all I have. ” The father looked at the tattoo on his arm. His son, 24, had one to match, he said. He looked at his phone. “He was trying to  —   all the comms were down. He was trying to call me,” he said. The Fitzgerald collided with a ship four times its size off the coast of Japan in   darkness. Military officials still don’t know what happened exactly, but it is clear that sailors tried to save one another in the aftermath. A woman told the Associated Press that four of those killed slept in the same room as her son, who had repeatedly dived into the flood trying to save them.       Seven U. S. sailors went missing after a U. S. Navy destroyer collided with a   merchant ship off the coast of Japan on June 17. A number of the missing sailors were found dead in the destroyer’s flooded berthing compartments. (Elyse Samuels, Monica   Washington Post)   As rescuers searched for    Gary Rehm Jr. a shipmate stayed on board the listing Fitzgerald and texted reports to his wife in the United States, Rehm’s    told The Washington Post. “She said she wasn’t leaving the ship until they found him,” Joan Braniff said. “They kicked her off, and she stayed on the pier until they found him. ” Now Erin Rehm is a widow. They had been married for nearly all of the fire controlman’s   Navy service, Braniff said.   [When Navy ships collide, there is virtually always human error involved]   “You could tell right from the start he just adored her,” she said. They sang karaoke on a PlayStation in Hampton, Va. when he was home. They talked many times each day when he was deployed, as he had been on the Fitzgerald for nearly two years, according to the Navy. “He was supposed to be coming home in September,” Braniff said. And next year, she said, Rehm was planning to retire from the military and stay home for good. “I assumed they would be together forever,” Braniff said. Two hours up the highway from the home that Rehm will never return to, the Lake Monticello volunteer fire department held a news conference over the weekend to announce the death of Dakota Rigsby  —   19 and one of their own. An assistant chief called him a “good kid” and good firefighter, the Richmond   reported. He’d left tiny Palmyra, Va. last year to become a gunner’s mate seaman. Stars and Stripes reported that Rigsby got to meet the secretary of the Navy before his last night on the Fitzgerald. In Oakville, Conn. the sister of    Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc Truong Huynh remembered him as a quiet, sweet, selfless man who had not always desired a military life. “But he wanted to do something adventurous,” Huynh’s sister told the Hartford Courant. So he enlisted about two years before his death.   [‘There wasn’t a lot of time’ as water flooded U. S. destroyer below decks]   From the town of Weslaco near the   border, Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez had spent eight years in the Navy, and in that time impressed his family with photos from Italy and the Pacific Ocean. “We all came from poverty in Guatemala,” Aly   told CBS 11. “He was the one who made it. ” Now the photos he’d sent home were how his cousin remembered him, while his wife mourned him with their young son. Carlos Victor Sibayan grew up with a military father who was often absent, deployed on a ship somewhere, his mother told NBC 7. So Sibayan had assumed a patriarch’s role as a child, and helped raise his younger siblings outside San Diego. “One thing that my son always told me is he has my back,” Carmen Sibayan told the station. He was still a teenager in 2013, when he followed his father’s example and enlisted. During the three years he’d spent on board the Fitzgerald, his mother said, his father had retired from the military and come home. Her son, a fire controlman, had been set to leave the ship and join them back in California in less than a month, she said. Then came the crash. “We just borrow this time from God,” the mother said. “So now he has to go back. ” The final victim from the wreck in Japan, Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Douglass, also grew up in the country. The son of a Marine stationed in Okinawa in the late 2000s, Stars and Stripes reported, he was remembered as the class clown at a U. S.   high school. Douglass’s family moved to California before he graduated from high school in 2010, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. Four years later, he enlisted in the Navy and soon after returned to Japan. His early duties on the Fitzgerald were menial  —   sanding, painting, raising and lowering the rafts, according to a Navy news release quoted by the paper. But Douglass told the Navy he was proud of his work and was excited to be in the military. Service was important to the family, retired Master Sgt. Stephen Douglass told the   shortly after his son’s death. “My mind’s going a mile a minute,” he said. “We’re still in sort of a state of shock. ” Related stories:  Missing U.

"Honolulu to settle suit from lesbians jailed after kissing. HONOLULU  —   Honolulu has agreed to pay $80, 000 to settle a lawsuit from two gay women who allege a police officer wrongfully arrested them after seeing them kissing in a grocery store. Details of the settlement were announced Friday in federal court in Honolulu. It’s still subject to City Council approval. The council is expected to consider the settlement at a July 6 meeting, said Honolulu Deputy Corporation Counsel Nicolette Winter. Courtney Wilson and Taylor Guerrero were visiting Hawaii from Los Angeles last year when, according to the their lawsuit, they were harassed and arrested because the officer didn’t like their public displays of affection in a Foodland store on Oahu’s North Shore. They were walking through the aisles holding hands and at one point hugged and kissed, the lawsuit said. Officer Bobby Harrison, who was shopping in uniform, “observed their consensual romantic contact and, in a loud voice, ordered plaintiffs to stop and ‘take it somewhere else. ’” The women complied and continued shopping, the lawsuit said. When Harrison again saw them being affectionate with each other, he threatened to have them thrown out of the store. While the women were in the   line, Harrison grabbed Wilson by the wrist, and she started to call 911, the women described last year. All three got into a scuffle and Harrison arrested them. They were charged with felony assault on an officer and spent three days in jail. Charges were eventually dismissed. After the lawsuit was filed, the Honolulu Police Department opened an internal investigation. Results of the investigation weren’t immediately available Friday. The settlement dismisses Harrison from the lawsuit and isn’t an admission of any wrongdoing, Winter said. Wilson said she and Guerrero are no longer a couple but remain friends. She went back to Los Angeles while Guerrero decided to stay in Honolulu. “I’m glad it’s over, but at the same time we wanted the officer to suffer some sort of repercussion,” Wilson said. Guerrero ended up working and living in Honolulu partly because a condition of their release from jail required them to say on the island. By the time the charges were dismissed, Guerrero found she liked living here. “I’m happy with it,” Guerrero said of the settlement. “I’m just glad it’s over with. ” After paying their attorneys, Wilson and Guerrero plan to split what’s left from the settlement amount.",1.0

"Senate Democrats have the power to stop Trump. All they have to do is use it..      As a Democratic Senate aide for the past seven years, I had a   seat to an impressive show of obstruction. Republicans, under   Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, decided they would oppose President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at every turn to limit their power. And it worked: They extorted concessions from Democrats with threats of shutdowns, fiscal cliffs and financial chaos. I know firsthand that Democrats’ passion for responsible governance can be exploited by Republicans who are willing to blow past all norms and standards. Now we have a president who exemplifies that willingness in the extreme. Partly, this explains why he faces more questions about his legitimacy than any president in recent history and why he drew three times as many protesters as inauguration attendees last weekend. But in something of a mismatch, Republicans’ unified control of government means that the most effective tool for popular resistance lies in the Senate  —   the elite, byzantine institution envisioned by the founders as the saucer that cools the teacup of popular opinion. Senate Democrats have a powerful tool at their disposal, if they choose to use it, for resisting a president who has no mandate and cannot claim to embody the popular will. That tool lies in the simple but fitting act of withholding consent. An organized effort to do so on the Senate floor can bring the body to its knees and block or severely slow down the agenda of a president who does not represent the majority of Americans. The procedure for withholding consent is straightforward, but deploying it is tricky. For the Senate to move in a timely fashion on any order of business, it must obtain unanimous support from its members. But if a single senator objects to a consent agreement, McConnell, now majority leader, will be forced to resort to   procedural steps through the cloture process, which takes four days to confirm nominees and seven days to advance any piece of legislation  —   and that’s without amendment votes, each of which can be subjected to a   cloture process as well. McConnell can ask for consent at any time, and if no objection is heard, the Senate assumes that consent is granted. So the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus must work together  —   along with any Republicans who aren’t afraid of being targeted by an angry tweet  —   to ensure that there is always a senator on the floor to withhold consent. Because every Senate action requires the unanimous consent of members from all parties, everything it does is a leverage point for Democrats. For instance, each of the   nominees requiring Senate confirmation  —   including President Trump’s Cabinet choices  —   can be delayed for four days each. While the tactic works well, as we’ve seen for the past eight years, there remains the question of strategy. Should Democrats be pragmatic and let Trump have his nominees on a reasonable timetable, so as not to appear obstructionist? So far, this has been their approach to some of Trump’s Cabinet picks. But it’s also fair to say that, by nominating a poorly qualified and ethically challenged Cabinet, Trump forfeited his right to a speedy confirmation process, and Democrats should therefore slow it down to facilitate the adequate vetting that Trump and Senate Republicans are determined to avoid by rushing the process before all the questionnaires and filings are submitted. Four days of scrutiny on the Senate floor per nominee, even after the committee hearings, is a reasonable standard for fulfilling the Senate’s constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. Democrats can also withhold their consent from every piece of objectionable legislation McConnell tries to advance. With 48 senators in their caucus, they have the votes to block most bills. But even when Democrats don’t have the votes, they can force McConnell to spend time jumping through procedural hoops. This is the insight McConnell deployed against Reid to manufacture the appearance of gridlock, forcing him to use the cloture process more than 600 times. Finally, Democrats can withhold their consent from Trump until they feel confident that foreign governments are not interfering in our elections. Credible reports hold that U. S. intelligence agencies are investigating whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with the Russian government on Vladi mir Putin’s personally directed meddling. Withholding consent from Trump’s agenda until an independent, bipartisan probe provides answers is not just reasonable; it’s responsible. If Democrats withhold consent from everything the Senate does until such a process is established, they can stall Trump’s agenda and confirmation of his nominees indefinitely. Sen. Richard Durbin has been a leader in demanding an independent investigation. But unless Democrats back their calls with the threat of action, McConnell will steamroll them and never look back. Of course, it would be unwise to deploy this strategy blindly. The kind of universal obstruction pioneered by McConnell during Obama’s presidency is not in Democrats’ nature: They believe in the smooth functioning of government. But Democrats’ concern with delivering results for their constituents is also part of who we are and something we should embrace. Even for innately cautious Democrats, some issues demand dramatic action. If Trump wants to put their concerns about his legitimacy to rest, he can reach out with consensus nominees and policies, and come clean about his ties to Russia and his tax returns (which may show whether he has compromising financial debts to Russian interests). Until then, Democrats can stand up for America by withholding their consent.      Lies, untruths or misstatements? Post columnist Margaret Sullivan looks at how different newsrooms are reporting President Trump’s claims over crowd size and voter fraud and how ”alternative facts” can damage a democracy.

"From Clinton and Trump, harshly negative arguments with two weeks to go.   GOFFSTOWN, N. H.  —   Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump each launched fresh attacks against the other on Monday, signaling that harshly negative closing arguments may dominate the final two weeks of the campaign. Clinton’s campaign tried to build on its case that Trump doesn’t respect women, while Trump again questioned the integrity of the election process  —   this time asserting that polls showing Clinton ahead across the country are “phony” and “rigged. ” Perhaps the most intense rhetoric of the day came from Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) one of Clinton’s top allies, who said Trump’s disregard for women would be his undoing in the election. As Trump continued to suggest that he might not accept a Clinton victory on Nov. 8, Warren seemed to revel in the role that women may play not only in defeating him but also in electing the first female president in the nation’s history. “I’ve got news for you, Donald Trump,” Warren said, standing on a windswept stage in this college town alongside Clinton and U. S. Senate candidate Maggie Hassan  —   and riffing on Trump’s reference to Clinton as a “nasty woman” during their third presidential debate. “Women have had it with guys like you. And nasty women have really had it with guys like you. Yeah, get this, Donald: Nasty women are tough, nasty women are smart, and nasty women vote. ” Although the Clinton campaign has been working for weeks to portray Trump as a misogynist, allies and surrogates jumped on his latest utterance to continue the effort. Pop star Katy Perry wore a   emblazoned with “Nasty Woman” while knocking on dormitory doors for Clinton in Las Vegas. Other merchandise, including   pillows and coffee mugs, popped up for sale on the Internet.     Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called polls that show him lagging behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ”rigged” because, he said, the polls sample too many Democrats. The sampling Trump referred to is considered standard methodology for political polling. (The Washington Post)   “He thinks because he has a mouth full of   that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance,” Warren said Monday, referring to a 2005 video in which Trump lewdly described forcing himself on women and then took the breath mints as he explained he liked to kiss women without asking permission.  With just 15 days left until Election Day, Trump spent Monday in Florida, telling supporters that the national media has deliberately skewed polls to undermine his candidacy and that he is actually winning. During a discussion with farmers at Bedner’s Farm Fresh Market in Boynton Beach, Fla. Trump devoted nearly half of his   public remarks to criticizing the news media. “I believe we’re actually winning,” he said, speaking in a   structure adorned with decorative gourds. He asserted that the majority of public opinion polls, which show Clinton leading nationally and in most battleground states, reflect the “crooked system, the rigged system I’ve been talking about since I entered the race. ” “What they do is they show these phony polls where they look at Democrats, and it’s heavily weighted with Democrats, and then they’ll put on a poll where we’re not winning, and everybody says, ‘Oh they’re not winning,’ ” he added. His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, acknowledged Sunday that her candidate trails Clinton, saying, “We are behind. ” But Trump said Monday that he trusts the two polls that have shown him leading  —   Investor’s Business Daily and Rasmussen  —   as more reliable.     More than 2. 5M votes were cast before the final debate. Does it matter? View Graphic     More than 2. 5M votes were cast before the final debate. Does it matter?  Later Monday, as Trump campaigned in St. Augustine, Fla. his supporters said they were unfazed by Trump’s “nasty woman” comment or Warren’s attempts to raise it. “Pocahontas has lied before,” said Cleta Van Horn, 78, of St. Augustine, referring to a disparaging nickname Trump often applies to the senator from Massachusetts. Van Horn was seated at the rally next to her daughter, Laura Nelson, 47, also of St. Augustine. Nelson said she also was not bothered by Trump’s remark and Democratic attempts to use it against him. “I think they are overblowing everything,” said Nelson, who passionately waved a   sign over her head when the GOP nominee took the stage. Among Clinton supporters, however, there was evidence of a ripple effect of Trump’s remark. Diana Hess, a Clinton supporter who is now an advocate for people with disabilities, said that the phrase has ricocheted across her social circle on social media and elsewhere. “My friends have been saying to me: ‘We’re nasty women who vote,’ ” said Hess, 58. “We took it as a call to action. Women don’t deserve to be treated the way they’ve been treated by Donald Trump. ”  Trump then turned his fire on Clinton’s use of a personal email server while secretary of state. He said the FBI and Justice Department had inappropriately let her off the hook. “We have to investigate the investigation, folks,” Trump said. Trump on Monday also addressed the latest accusations of inappropriate sexual contact made against him, saying of the accuser, an adult film performer, “Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before. ” Calling into WGIR radio’s “New Hampshire Today,” Trump characterized the allegations against him as “total fiction,” including the behavior alleged by Jessica Drake. On Saturday, she accused Trump of grabbing her and kissing her without permission and offering her money to go up to his hotel room about a decade ago. “She’s a porn star,” Trump said. “You know, this one that came out recently, ‘he grabbed me and he grabbed me on the arm.’ Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before. ” Trump also seized on a Wall Street Journal report that the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) a leading Clinton supporter, gave $452, 500 to a Northern Virginia state Senate candidate last year. The candidate, Jill McCabe of Loudoun County, is married to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who oversaw the bureau’s investigation into Clinton’s use of the private server. The state Democratic Party reportedly gave McCabe’s campaign another $207, 788. Trump called the donations “absolutely disgraceful” and alleged without presenting evidence that “Hillary knew this money was being paid. ” Aides to McAuliffe and others said Monday that the timeline of events was inconsistent with any suggestion of wrongdoing. McAuliffe’s support of Jill McCabe was part of a much broader effort at the time to try to win back a Democratic majority in the Virginia Senate, and his PAC gave greater amounts to other candidates. At the time McAuliffe recruited Jill McCabe to run for office, her husband was in another job, and there was no publicly known FBI investigation into the Clinton emails. By the time he was promoted to deputy director and assumed responsibility for the Clinton email investigation, his wife had been out of politics for several months.  Clinton and her backers sought to capi tal ize on Trump’s declining poll numbers by lifting up candidates lower on the ballot this fall. The appearance with Warren was also designed to promote the candidacy of Hassan, the current governor of New Hampshire who is challenging Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R). Warren’s appearance was part of the Clinton campaign’s effort to flood swing states with   endorsers as the campaign comes to a close. It was also a tacit show of unity between Clinton and very liberal voters who consider Warren a champion and who, in New Hampshire, preferred liberal primary challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders over the moderate Clinton by a wide margin. But mostly Warren, whose lines got louder applause than Clinton’s, was there as the best provocateur the Clinton campaign can field against Trump. He has engaged in several fierce attacks on Warren, often via Twitter. “She gets under his thin skin like nobody else,” a delighted Clinton said at the start of her remarks. Later Monday, Clinton was scheduled to attend a   fundraising party in Manhattan with a birthday theme and entertainment by singer and composer Stevie Wonder. Clinton turns 69 on Wednesday. The New York event and another on Tuesday in South Florida are likely to be Clinton’s last   fundraisers of the campaign. They cap a   run since she announced for president in April 2015 in which the candidate rarely went more than a few days without headlining some kind of event with paying guests. Clinton’s reliance on big checks from wealthy donors brought sharp criticism from primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this year, but the strategy gave her an edge in fundraising over Trump.  President Obama also plugged Clinton’s candidacy on Monday. “The good news is that at the moment the polls show that Hillary is enjoying a lead,” Obama said outside a fundraiser in La Jolla, Calif. But he added that the “volatile” nature of the race meant that “we can’t take anything for granted. ” “There are a lot of states like Ohio and Florida that are way too close to call,” he said, adding that it was important to “make sure that people actually turn out to vote. ” Trump started the week with a focus on two critical states in the Southeast: Florida and North Carolina. In a sign of the intense battle over Florida, Trump’s plane and that of the Democratic   nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, were parked on the same Miami tarmac Monday. Before leaving Miami, Trump did a radio interview with WBT Radio host Bo Thompson, making his case to listeners in Charlotte. He accused the media of engaging in “a   the likes of which nobody’s ever seen. ”  “I’m going to protect the people, and the media are the exact opposite, and they, you know, represent the opposite,” Trump said. He added he has a development near Charlotte that has been a “tremendous success” and would contribute to his winning the state. “So I understand North Carolina very well. ” Despite his claims elsewhere that he’s winning, Trump conceded during the interview that he’s trailing in the polls. But he also predicted an upset victory nonetheless. “I think we’re gonna have a Brexit situation,” said, he referring to the British referendum in which voters unexpectedly decided to leave the European Union. “You know, that one was behind in the polls, and I guess I’m somewhat behind in the polls but not by much. I mean, in your state, I’m one point, two points and even in three polls. One point, two points and even. ” Trump also announced Monday that his Facebook page would start hosting “nightly campaign coverage from Trump Tower. ” He did something similar before the final debate, promoting a webcast featuring surrogates and a video message from his daughter Ivanka. The announcement comes as some observers have speculated that Trump might start a media venture if he is not elected president. He has sought to tamp down such speculation.

"Obama’s White House photographer is now America’s foremost purveyor of anti-Trump Instagram shade.  As the chief official White House photographer for President Barack Obama, Pete Souza spent eight years capturing snapshots of some of the most intimate and important moments in Obama’s tenure. Now he’s sharing those photos to create the Instagram version of a subtweet of President Donald Trump.    It all began on January 21, the day after Trump’s inauguration. When photos circulated showing that Trump had redecorated the Oval Office with golden drapes, Souza took to Instagram to let everyone know he preferred Obama’s aesthetic choices.       I like these drapes better than the new ones. Don’t you think? A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 21, 2017 at 7:36pm PST    Then on January 30, amid the controversy resulting from Trump’s immigration and refugee order, Souza posted a photo of President Obama meeting with Alex, a young boy who had written Obama a letter urging him to help a Syrian boy depicted in a viral photo from Aleppo. “In my school, I have a friend from Syria, Omar, and I will introduce him to Omar. We can all play together,” Alex wrote.       Remember Alex, the    boy who wrote President Obama a letter about the Syrian boy photographed in the ambulance. Alex visited the Oval Office with his family the day after the election. ”Dear President Obama,  Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria? Can you please go get him and bring him to [my home]? Park in the driveway or on the street and we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons. We will give him a family and he will be our brother. Catherine, my little sister, will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. In my school, I have a friend from Syria, Omar, and I will introduce him to Omar. We can all play together. We can invite him to birthday parties and he will teach us another language. We can teach him English too, just like my friend Aoto from Japan. Please tell him that his brother will be Alex who is a very kind boy, just like him. Since he won’t bring toys and doesn’t have toys Catherine will share her big blue stripy white bunny. And I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him additions and subtractions in math. And he [can] smell Catherine’s lip gloss penguin which is green. She doesn’t let anyone touch it.  Thank you very much! I can’t wait for you to come! Alex 6 years old ” A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 30, 2017 at 2:37pm PST    The next day, after Trump announced his nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Souza highlighted Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, who was never confirmed due to Republican opposition.           Merrick Garland. Just saying. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Jan 31, 2017 at 5:28pm PST    When reports surfaced in early February that Trump had feuded with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on the phone, Souza reminded everyone of the nature of Obama’s relationship with him.          Talking with then Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, left, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia last September at the ASEAN gala dinner. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 2, 2017 at 2:21pm PST    As Trump’s Cabinet and senior advisers began to settle into the White House, Souza posted a photo of some of Obama’s key advisers  —   who all share a key feature in the image. Though Souza had withheld explicit criticism thus far, on February 6 he was more direct in this caption: “This is a   picture. I guess you’d say I was trying to make a point. ”       Meeting with top advisors. This is a   picture. I guess you’d say I was trying to make a point. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 6, 2017 at 9:29am PST    Then on February 11, when White House press pool reporters were stuck in a room with   windows as Trump golfed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Souza shared an image that captured Obama’s more favorable relationship with the press.          Gesturing towards the White House press pool while golfing with Prime Minister Cameron last year in the U. K. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 11, 2017 at 5:52pm PST    Early the following week, it was reported that Trump had handled documents relating to a North Korean missile test in plain sight over dinner at his    resort. Souza took to Instagram again to show how Obama addressed national security matters while traveling.       When we were on the road, national security discussions and head of state phone calls were conducted in a private, secure location set up onsite. Everyone had to leave their Blackberry outside the area. In this photo, which was taken in March 2011 and subsequently released, the President holds a discussion in El Salvador following a conference call with his full national security team. A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 13, 2017 at 1:39pm PST    Souza’s most direct indirect address to Trump came following a chaotic press conference on February 16 in which Trump continually railed against what he called “fake news. ” Noting that he was once a press photographer, Souza pushed back: “Freedom of the press is one of the bedrock principles of our country. ”        Freedom of the press is one of the bedrock principles of our country. In addition to being a White House photographer for President Obama and President Reagan, I’ve spent a significant chunk of my career as a member of the press. So I think I have a good perspective on this. Sometimes people don’t like what the press is doing. But that doesn’t mean the press should stop taking pictures or stop writing stories. (Since some will ask: many years ago, this guy was upset because I was taking pictures of county officials trying to contain a suspicious fire at his factory. He made the mistake of punching me out while a police officer was standing next to me.) A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Feb 16, 2017 at 11:56am PST    And Souza didn’t stop there. Most recently, after Trump referenced a nonexistent refugee terrorist attack in Sweden, Souza posted a photo of Obama’s 2013 trip to the country.       Remembering our great trip to Sweden in 2013.

"Bills pile on ‘terrible’ Colin Kaepernick: He’s ‘done’. The city of Buffalo   as Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers came to town Sunday. Then the city’s team destroyed the quarterback, both on and off the field. Kaepernick, making his first start since his polarizing national anthem protest began, drew mixed reviews in a   stomping. He bounced several throws, with his right arm looking decidedly rusty, though his feet (eight carries, 66 yards) provided a spark to a 49ers offense that has looked lifeless. He finished    for 187 yards and a touchdown, but even the stats are misleading. He hooked up with an   Torrey Smith for a   on a severely underthrown pass. The guys who got the closest view of his performance showed little mercy. He’s “done,” one  . “Terrible,” he added. “More a distraction than a contributing member of the team. ” The “distraction” had been relegated to the sideline this season, sitting behind a struggling Blaine Gabbert during the team’s   start. On the bench, Kaepernick gained notoriety  —   both through copycats and furious detractors  —   for taking a knee during “The   Banner,” citing an oppression of minorities in his refusal to stand to honor the country. Kaepernick has been resolute and clear in his message. Where there has been ambiguity is the play of the    who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl following the 2012 season but fell off a planet afterward, the erosion of his skills coinciding with the dismantling of a   title contender. His attempt to revive his career exposed him, Buffalo’s Stephon Gilmore said, as a quarterback who can’t pass. “We wanted to do everything we could to make him throw the ball,” the cornerback said. “I mean, he’s an athlete. You can’t take that from him. But when it comes to passing the ball, he can’t really throw. We took advantage of that. We wanted to make him beat us with his arm, and he couldn’t do that. ” Granted, Kaepernick had no help around him. San Francisco’s defense is abysmal, its offense lacking weapons, its offensive line allowing three sacks of Kaepernick. “We knew he was going to be rusty,” linebacker Zach Brown said. “So we just had to bring the heat. Because at the end of the day, we had to make sure he pays. Get him moving and our players will get him. Our corners and DBs are better than their receivers. ”",1.0
"Trump can’t use his personal helicopter anymore. President Trump is barred from using his private helicopter  —   but that didn’t stop him from showing it off all weekend on the front lawn of his    resort.

While in office, presidents are only allowed to fly on Air Force One or Marine One, the   ’s personal helicopter. It’s standard Secret Service protocol and has been done for decades.

"After a terrorist attack, we grow fearful. Here’s what that does to our brains..    brought America into a new era of fear.  As Vox’s Alvin Chang explains, after the attacks, American’s level of fear stayed permanently elevated, despite the fact the world has become arguably safer.          It’s a testament to the subtle psychological power of fear. Events like   like the Boston Marathon bombing, like the Paris massacre, like the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, all have the power to change the way we see the world and think about others.     Over the last year, in the wake of several more terrorist attacks, I’ve spoken to a number of psychologists and asked them all the same question: What does that fear do to our minds?  This is what I learned.  1) Fear heightens our suspicions of the world and makes us more pessimistic about the future Fear colors everything we encounter with a tinge of dread. That impacts our behavior and even our politics in surprising ways.     “Fear causes higher perception of risk everywhere, greater precautionary behavior, greater favorability of action policy that prioritizes safety over personal liberty,” Deborah Small, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania who studies decision making, writes me in an email.     In 2002, Small was part of a research effort at Carnegie Mellon University that asked: Could reminding participants of their   fears change their outlook on America? In a field experiment, Small and her colleagues either stoked people’s fears of   or anger about it via a writing prompt. (Anger, they thought, would lead to different behaviors than fear.) Then, the participants were asked to agree or disagree with prompts about the future, such as “Safety in airline travel will improve dramatically  …    ” and “Another major terrorist attack will occur within the next 12 months. ”     Their conclusion: “Experiencing more anger triggered more optimistic beliefs; experiencing more fear triggered greater pessimism. ”  2) Fear makes us more suspicious of foreigners  Just hours after news broke that three explosions in Brussels, Belgium, claimed many lives in a terrorist attack in March, Donald Trump described exactly what he would do to protect the fearful. He told Fox News: ”I would close up our borders. ”  Sen. Ted Cruz issued a statement not long after: ”We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant   or ISIS presence.”     These reactions are familiar. These politicians  —   and others  —   made similar statements after the November terrorist attacks in Paris killed 130. At that time, the fear was that ISIS attackers could sneak into countries alongside refugees. (It turned out all of the identified Paris attackers were European.) But these   admonitions expose an unchanging truth: When global terror threats fill the news, lines between ”us” and ”them” get drawn. And Muslim immigrants, Syrian refugees and any other potential refugees or migrants may unfairly get labeled as ”them” in the aftermath. ”When attacks happen, there’s a [perceived] high cost in mistaking     members for one another,” says Mina Cikara, who runs the intergroup neuroscience lab at Harvard. I had spoken to Cikara  —   and other psychologists who study group fears  —   in the wake of the Paris attacks in November. ”So when you see an attack like the one in Beirut or the one in Paris, it highlights those boundaries between ’us’ and ’them.’ It means those boundaries become more closely circumscribed; they become tinier.” It also means, Cikara says, that we overexaggerate our perceptions of who ”they” are. Innocent Syrian refugees  —   or peaceful immigrants with a Muslim upbringing  —   can get wrapped up in our notions of who is a terrorist, no matter what the statistics say. ”Threat is the catalyst that shifts us from   disregard or indifference to   hostility,” she says. 3) When we fear outsiders, we dehumanize them You can think of human psychology as a series of evolutionarily coded computer programs. These programs tell us how to react to new situations. When we see a baby, we want to pinch its cheeks. When we see a threatening stranger, we either want to fight them or flee from them.    Fearing others changes the way we perceive them. In experiments, this plays out in very literal and disturbing ways: In some experiments, psychologists can get participants to rate outsiders as having fewer human qualities. 4) And our brains exaggerate their threat New York University psychologist Jay Van Bavel and his colleague Y. Jenny Xiao illustrated this concept nicely in a 2012 paper. The test was simple: The researchers asked participants to estimate the   distance from New York to Mexico City. Participants who expressed more animosity toward Mexican immigrants rated Mexico City as being several hundred miles closer to New York than people who felt less threatened. And, Van Bavel adds, ”We have new data showing that if people think the wall between the countries is secure, this effect goes away.” 5) Fear likely makes our stalemate politics even more stagnant ”The threat of terrorism  —   like many sources of threat, can lead to more rigid thinking  —   less attention to ambiguity,” Robb Willer, a sociologist at Stanford University, told me after the Orlando shooting.  This can be a good thing in a chaotic situation, as it makes more economical use of our mental resources, narrowing our focus. And there is plenty of rich public conversation today around gun control and a more inclusive America. It’s also true that, at times, terrorism and other horrific events have brought the country together, Willer notes. Think of the days after   when George W. Bush’s approval ratings were near 90 percent.    But lately, these moments haven’t become opportunities to build bridges with political opponents. Instead, attacks have highlighted divisiveness.  Ingrid Haas, a political psychologist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, studies the intersection of two emotions that typically flare in the wake of a terrorist attack: uncertainty and fear. These are the two psychological weapons terrorists most effectively yield: making us feel threatened going about our daily lives in the places where we feel safe, and the feeling of not knowing where an attack might occur. Haas predicts that when we feel both uncertain and threatened, we become more intolerant of political opponents (this is true of both liberals and conservatives). She found this in a series of experiments published in a 2014 paper in Political Psychology. ”The fact that the exact nature of the threat is   …     unclear means that people have a difficult time coping with it,” she told me in one of our conversations. With that difficulty coping, she finds, people become less accepting of new ideas. She recently followed up on this research in a paper published in May in Basic and Applied Social Psychology. It found that the combination of uncertainty and threat makes people  —   and especially conservatives  —   less willing to compromise. ”This may be reason to believe that political conservatives are especially likely to respond to the (uncertain) threat of terrorism by decreasing their willingness to compromise about political issues,” she wrote me in March. (Simpler: Don’t expect Trump to back down from his Muslim ban.) From a biological standpoint, too, it makes sense that terrorist attacks can polarize the country. Some of us are just hardwired to respond more strongly to negative stimuli.    A lot of this work on the biological underpinnings of politics comes from the lab of John Hibbing and Kevin B. Smith at the University of Nebraska. I wrote about their work in a 2014 story for National Journal: In his experiments, Hibbing often attaches electrodes to liberal and conservative participants’ skin and then shows them disturbing images, such as a man eating a handful of worms. In these tests, conservatives sweat more (i. e. have a stronger gut reaction) in response to the disgusting stimulus. And when Hibbing hooks participants up to   machines, he finds conservatives monitor more closely the things that make them squirm. So they are more readily provoked and more vigilant Liberal commentators sometimes use Hibbing and Smith’s research to belittle conservatives and say they are too reactionary and less measured. Another way to look at it is that evolution has perhaps favored human communities wherein liberal minds and conservative minds are in constant tension. In our history  —   stretching tens of thousands of years  —   it’s likely each strategy has proven its merits in aiding our survival. 6) Fear makes us bad    In the 2000s, neuroscientist Gregory Berns ran experiments during which participants were intermittently shocked while having their brain scanned in an fMRI machine.  The shocks occurred every one to 30 seconds, without warning.  “Nearly a third feared waiting so much that, when given the chance, they preferred getting a bigger shock right away to waiting for a smaller shock later,” Berns wrote on his experiment in the New York Times.  “It sounds illogical, but fear  —   whether of pain or of losing a job  —   does strange things to  . ”     Here’s an example of that playing out in the real world.  After   there was an understandable  —   but irrational  —   fear of flying. Accounting for the terrorist attacks, flying was still much safer than driving a car. (People are still afraid of flying because of  . In a 2011 poll  —   10 years after the attack  —   Gallup found 24 percent of respondents agreed that   made them less willing to fly on airplanes.) There were 42, 116 motor vehicle deaths in 2001. Many who would have flown in   safety died on roadways as a result of the fear.  Gerd Gigerenzer, the director of the Max Planck Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition, labels this the “indirect damage” of terrorism. “Indirect damage is not under the control of terrorists; it is mediated through the minds of citizens,” Gigerenzer wrote in a 2006 paper. In it, he estimates that   led to an additional 1, 505 fatal road crashes in the 12 months after the attacks. (Gigerenzer also analyzed transportation data from Spain after the 2004 terrorist attacks on Madrid’s railways, and found that while Spaniards reduced their train travel, they did not compensate with additional road travel.) 7) How can we fight fear?  It’s not wrong to be fearful. Fear is a normal human reaction. It can help us survive. But it can be abused by politicians hoping to make political gains. The researchers I spoke with over the last year have some suggestions for managing the uglier reactions to fear. One: The passage of time helps in reducing negative emotions. Haas offered a very practical solution in the wake of the Paris attack. ”Maybe a better recommendation is just that we should wait a little while for the emotional response to die down a bit before making major decisions about changes to immigration policy, escalation of war,” she says.    ”It’s going to be difficult for people to make   decisions when the emotional response is so strong. This is probably better advice than trying to get average citizens to digest statistical information in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, which is usually what professors like to recommend. ” Two: Know that even though fear can heighten our prejudices, there are ways to overcome them. “These [psychological] systems are flexible, they can turn on a dime,” Cikara told me. ”if that’s true, they can also improve on a dime. ” In April, I reported on an experiment that showed with just the right dose of empathy, canvassers could change voters’ mind on transgender rights issues. ”Two decades of opinion change took place during a   conversation, and it persisted for at least three months  —   that’s a big effect,” Josh Kalla, one of the experiment’s   told me. All it took was a conversation where the voter was asked to put themselves in a transgender person’s shoes. That type of outreach is difficult, but not impossible. ",-1.0
"Why bed bugs have made a horrifying comeback.  For 60 years, Americans thought they’d vanquished bedbugs forever. They were wrong. Horribly, horribly wrong.    Bedbugs have been a staple of American life since the Mayflower. In 1926, infestations in hotels and apartments had become so common that experts couldn’t recall a time when they weren’t a problem. People hated being bitten in the night by these pesky bloodsuckers hiding in mattresses, but the bugs seemed impossible to wipe out. Then everything changed in 1939, when a Swiss chemist named Paul Hermann Muller discovered the pesticide DDT, which proved stunningly effective at killing insects. For decades thereafter, DDT and other chemicals helped keep America’s homes and hotels  . But it didn’t last. Since 2000, a new strain of   bedbugs has been popping up in the US. In 2009, there were 11, 000 reported complaints in New York City alone. In New Jersey, a Rutgers study found, fully 1 in 8   apartments had infestations, with bugs hiding in sofas, beds, and tiny cracks in the wall. Many residents don’t realize anything’s amiss until they wake up in the night with strange bites and rashes. By then, the unwelcome guests can be tough to get rid of.    One of the best recent books about bedbugs is Brooke Borel’s Infested: How the Bed Bug Infiltrated Our Bedroom and Took Over the World (the book was partially funded by the Alfred Sloan Foundation). Last year, I called Borel, a science journalist, to hear more about how bedbugs made a comeback, why they’re so tenacious, and whether we might ever get rid of them again.     Brad Plumer: I’d half assumed  bedbugs were a very recent phenomenon, so it was fascinating to see that even the ancient Egyptians were trying to cast spells to ward them off. Brooke Borel: Yeah, one thing that struck me were the similarities through history. When the bedbug resurgence happened in the last 15 years, we had all these newspaper articles saying, ”Oh my god, they’re in the movie theaters, they’re in this place, in that place.” But that’s always been the case. You can go back and read descriptions of old beds with jars around the legs that contained paraffin to ward off bedbugs. That’s just an   version of these little traps you can buy today to put under your bed. It’s an old story that’s been repeating itself forever.                 BP: There was this   period after World War II where we’d vanquished bedbugs. How did that happen? BB: A big part of that story happened in 1939, when a Swiss chemist [Paul Hermann Müller] discovered the insecticidal properties of DDT. These were the first synthetic insecticides, and they were way more effective than the natural botanicals or elemental poisons we had been using previously. Most insects had never experienced this type of poison before  —   and they were very vulnerable to it. So we were able to knock bedbug numbers down. One key thing about DDT is that it leaves a residue on surfaces for a long time: months, maybe even a year. That was especially effective against bedbugs, because they hide in cracks either during the day or whenever you’re not there to provide food. Earlier sprays might have dissipated or not gotten down into the cracks where the bedbugs were. But DDT leaves a residue, and bedbugs would walk through it in order to come eat. There might have been other factors in knocking down bedbug numbers, too. Some experts point to different housekeeping practices that emerged after World War II  —   people were using vacuum cleaners more, and so on. That’s more anecdotal than anything else. Or in the United Kingdom, they were able to reduce bedbug numbers before the war, in the 1930s, because they completely tore down all these tenement buildings and rebuilt them.     Bedbugs crawl around in a container on display during the second National Bed Bug Summit in Washington, DC, February 2, 2011. (Media for   Images   Images) BP: So how did bedbugs make a comeback? It wasn’t simply because we banned DDT in the 1970s, was it? BB: No. Some people still say the only reason we have bedbugs now is because we banned DDT [after concerns about its threat to wildlife]. But that’s just not true. We would’ve had this problem regardless of the ban. The bigger problem is that bedbugs were becoming resistant to DDT, and that was starting to happen way before the ban occurred. DDT and other pesticides work on the nervous system of insects  —   often by screwing with their ion channels and leaving them open so that it fries the nervous system. These new resistant bedbugs were essentially able to close that channel again, so that didn’t happen. BP: Okay, so some bedbugs evolved resistance to DDT. But how did they become so widespread? BB: The idea is that pockets of resistant bedbugs evolved somewhere in the world, probably in more than one place. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, you have this huge increase in air travel both domestically and internationally  —   it got cheaper through the deregulation of airlines in the US and a set of new treaties in the 1990s. That probably helped spread these resistant bedbugs. The question we still don’t know is where, exactly, the resistant bedbugs came from. One hypothesis is that it started in Eastern Europe. There’s also the idea that resistant bedbugs came from somewhere in Africa because of the use of   mosquito nets. I think that’s pretty compelling, too. [Pyrethroids are another pesticide that works by preventing the sodium channels of insects from closing.]           American Museum of Natural History entomologist Louis Sorkin feeds bedbugs on his hand in New York, April 17, 2014. (EMMANUEL    Images)    BP: So what is it that makes bedbugs so tenacious and hard to kill? Is it just this pesticide resistance? BB: I think it’s the combination of so many things. They’re cryptic insects, and they hide during the day, which makes them hard to detect with the human eye. But the resistance is definitely a problem. Bedbugs have what’s called a knockdown resistance  —   it’s the same genetic mutation that gives them resistance to DDT. Separately, there are enzymes called P450s that break down the insecticides more quickly, so that they’re not as toxic to insects. There’s also research that some insects may be growing thicker exoskeletons, making it tougher for insecticides to penetrate. There are other factors, too. Some people aren’t allergic to them, so they might catch the problem only far later, when it’s become a really bad infestation. Also, bedbugs can spread very easily in cities  —   because to get rid of them you have to work with other people sharing living space or sharing walls. That can be incredibly difficult. There’s also a lot of shame involved in having bedbugs. And it’s expensive to get rid of them. So people might initially try to hide the fact that they have an infestation  —  until it gets worse and worse, and then it’s spilling over to neighbors. BP: You mention in the book that you’ve experienced bedbug attacks several times. What is it that makes them so hellish? BB: Before I answer that, I will say the reason I think I’ve encountered them so often is that I’m really, really allergic. Like in this Chicago hotel [where, in the book, she gets bitten] I was staying with a friend, and he didn’t get any bites. But he just might not have been allergic. A lot of people might sleep in beds with bedbugs and not notice at all. Now, on the psychological part, probably any psychiatrist who has dealt with someone with bedbugs will tell you the same thing.    There is something about the fact that your bedroom is your sanctuary, and you’re also the most vulnerable in your bed, because you’re sleeping. You really don’t get much more vulnerable than that; you’re literally paralyzed. And to have something that’s hiding that you can’t see that comes out and attacks you in your sanctuary, that is just really psychological difficult.           Pestec technician Carlos I. Agurto inspects a couch cushion for bedbugs at an apartment April 30, 2009, in San Francisco, California. Cases of bedbug infestations are on the rise across the US, with many people bringing them into their homes after visiting hotels and airports. (Photo by Justin   Images) BP: Why can’t we just invent a new chemical or insecticide to kill these bedbugs? BB: It’s a pipeline problem, just like the discovery of antibiotics or other drugs or other insecticides. It gets increasingly difficult to find the right chemicals and figure out whether they’re safe enough for us to use. Bedbugs are especially difficult, because they live in our bedroom, and that’s one of the places we want to be especially careful when it comes to applying insecticides. So that’s part of the issue there. It’s also incredibly expensive to research and develop the ingredients that go into an insecticide. The estimate for pesticides is something like $256 million per active ingredient over a period of around a decade. And even though bedbugs seem like a big problem, and it seems like you could make money making a bedbug insecticide, it’s not anything compared to the amount of insecticides we use in agriculture. So it’s not necessarily a major focus of the chemical companies. BP: So what are the best ideas experts have come up with for getting rid of bedbugs? BB: Keep in mind that there’s a caveat for anything I could possibly say here. I do think heat treatments are very helpful  —   bedbugs don’t seem to be developing a resistance to those. Basically you heat a room to a certain temperature, and it kills the bugs and the eggs, without chemicals involved.    The caveats, though, are that this is expensive; it can cost thousands of dollars. It’s not necessarily the best approach in an apartment building, because if you only treat one unit, and the neighbors have bedbugs and aren’t taking care of the problem, then you’ve probably wasted that money, because the bedbugs are going to come back. Then the other problem is that people have been hearing about this and trying to do their own heat treatments. They’ll use a space heater or something inappropriate, and their houses will catch fire. So it’s not for everyone.           Bedbug insecticide products are displayed at the Bed Bug University North American Summit 2010 on September 22, 2010, in Rosemont, Illinois. (Brian   Images) BP: You did a lot of reporting on the   industry that’s sprung up around controlling bedbugs. And you seemed to come away skeptical. Why? BB: I think that especially in the United States, we’re still in this Wild West era for bedbug control. There are some people who really believe in their products, but their products are bad. You could walk into a store and see a product that says, ”Kills bedbugs on contact.” To a consumer, that sounds great, but all that means is you have to spray it directly on the bedbug. But bedbugs are often hiding, so that’s not necessarily helpful. There’s a lot of opportunity to take advantage of people’s fears. Even the Federal Trade Commission has caught wind of this  —   they had two cases against two companies against products advertised as   contact killers, and they said, ”You can’t advertise like this.” BP: Having written the book, what advice would you give for someone who discovered bedbugs in their room? BB: As far as the psychological stuff goes, I would say it’s going to suck  —   but don’t panic!    In every city and state, there’s a hodgepodge of rules for who’s responsible financially for a bedbug infestation. So the first step is getting educated on that. If you do rent, your landlord may be legally required to pay for bedbug treatments. As far as actual treatments go   …     I have a little section in the book where I say what I would do. It’s not going to be right for every person. Because I’m so allergic, I’d know pretty quickly if I did have bedbugs. So before calling an exterminator, I would try to do all my laundry, do a search and see if I could find the bedbugs and where they’re coming from, clean up, and then see if I was still getting bites. But that’s mainly because I’d be able to tell easily if I was still getting bitten. But that’s not necessarily right for everyone, and I don’t recommend that for each person. For the most part, I’d suggest people call a professional  —   though it can be daunting to figure out who’s good. BP: Do we know if the bedbug problem is getting worse in the United States? BB: It’s a little tough to say. In general, I don’t think the problem’s getting better; I don’t think there are fewer bugs. I do think people are not freaking out about them as much and are more knowledgeable on how to deal with them. There’s a survey by the National Pest Management Association, where they interview   people from all over the world and ask how many bedbug cases they had in the last year. And those numbers have continued to rise. Then again, that’s an industry group, and they’ve been making money out of this. It also really depends on the city. I’m working on an essay about bedbugs in New York City, where numbers show that 311 calls about bedbugs are going down, but those numbers can be deceiving [since a lot of people don’t necessarily make 311 calls when they have bedbugs].    BP: You interviewed a lot of scientists for the book  —   I loved all the pictures of researchers who raise bedbugs for study by feeding them on their own arms. BB: Some people still do that, though for a lot of these bedbug research labs they have way too many bugs to be able to do that. One of the fascinating things I learned was that it took a long time for scientists to figure out how best to keep bedbugs alive in the lab, given that they’re so hard to kill in the wild. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.  VIDEO: The fascinating process of decomposition    ",-1.0
"Kaspersky's Alleged Russia Ties Highlight the Risks of Antivirus. So far this week, separate reports have indicated that Russia exploited software from Kaspersky Lab to trawl US systems for classified data—in at least one case, successfully—and that North Korea hacked into classified South Korean military files. (It’s only Wednesday.) The common culprit? Antivirus software. While antivirus software ostensibly seems like a benefit—it can stop malware from infecting your computer—many security researchers have expressed reservations about it for years. And though the recent Russian and North Korean incidents involve fairly specific circumstances, they serve as sobering reminders of just how much can go wrong when you grant deep system access to software that may not be as secure as it seems. 'AV is pretty much the perfect bugging device on every computer it’s sold on.' ",0.0
"Ben Carson is essentially ending his campaign. Here’s how it all went wrong..  Ben Carson, the pathbreaking pediatric neurosurgeon turned Tea Party darling, plans to tell supporters he does not see a ”path forward” for his campaign and will not attend Thursday night’s Republican debate, according to a report in the Washington Post. He’s not technically suspending his campaign  —   not yet, anyway  —   but he’s essentially conceding it’s over.    Carson entered the campaign as a long shot, mostly coasting on notoriety he’s built up in conservative circles ever since he confronted President Barack Obama and assailed Obamacare at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. He was an immensely appealing figure to the Republican base. He’s not just black, but a bona fide hero in the black community, as Vox’s Jenée   explained last year. In a party that’s struggled to reach nonwhite voters, that was huge. His work in neurosurgery, including separating twins conjoined at the head, was genuinely groundbreaking. He had, by his telling, a Horatio Alger story of growing up poor in Detroit and using his smarts and willpower to pull himself out of it and into Yale and then medical school, which was music to the ears of economic conservatives eager to say it’s possible to escape poverty through hard work.    The brief rise of the Carson campaign The general view at the start of the campaign was that Carson was running for book sales. He has never worked in government, and doesn’t have the money and demagogic skill of Donald Trump. A presidential bid could raise his profile and sell some books, maybe boost his speaker fees, but he surely couldn’t win.    For a brief moment in the fall, however, he looked primed to win Iowa and at least give Trump a run for his money. After a long rise starting in June, Carson topped Trump in Iowa poll averages starting in early October:    His period in first place was brief  —   by October 31 Trump was edging him out again in Iowa  —   but for months he was second in national polls to Trump:       However, with good poll numbers comes scrutiny, and Carson withered in the face of it. At first, his problems were the typical ones that   faced. Like Herman Cain’s    plan before it, Carson’s biblically inspired flat tax proposal was roundly panned by people who actually know things about tax policy. In a   Marketplace interview with Kai Ryssdal, and the CNBC debate on October 28, Carson struggled to explain how a flat tax of 10 percent (his original idea, inspired by tithing) or even the 14. 9 percent tax he eventually settled on could come close to paying for the federal government. Estimates suggested it would leave the government $1 trillion a year short. Carson’s answer was that he’d ”close loopholes” and cut ”wasteful spending,” which isn’t really an answer at all. How conservatives fell out of love with him    The tax problem didn’t undo Carson. Much weirder problems did. First, there were problems with his biography, the very thing that attracted so many to him in the first place.    In his autobiography, Carson recalls ”punching a classmate in the face with his hand wrapped around a lock, leaving a bloody   gash in the boy’s forehead; attempting to attack his own mother with a hammer following an argument over clothes; hurling a large rock at a boy, which broke the youth’s glasses and smashed his nose; and, finally, thrusting a knife at the belly of his friend with such force that the blade snapped when it luckily struck a belt buckle covered by the boy’s clothes,” to quote CNN’s Scott Glover and Maeve Reston. But when Glover and Reston spoke to nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with Carson, none of them recalled Carson being that violent. ”I don’t know nothing about that,” classmate Gerald Ware told CNN. ”It would have been all over the whole school.” The Carson campaign vociferously disputed the reports, insisting that he was too a pathologically violent teenager, leading to totally accurate headlines like, ”Ben Carson Defends Himself Against Allegations That He Never Attempted to Murder a Child.” Worse still, it came to light that while Carson claimed he was offered a ”full scholarship” to West Point, he never even applied there. This led to some strange arguments about the meaning of the word ”scholarship” but in any case it contributed to the sense that Carson was embellishing his life story for effect. And given how central that life story is to his appeal among conservatives, the perception that it was exaggerated or outright false was devastating.   Ben Carson: Mahmoud Abbas, Ali Khamenei, Vladimir Putin met in 1968 Moscow http:  .  pic. twitter.   —   PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) October 9, 2015    The other problem was that Carson’s beliefs were wackier than anybody expected. He didn’t just have a magical tax plan: He thought Joseph of Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat fame built the Egyptian pyramids to store grain; he thought the Holocaust happened because of gun control; he thought Vladimir Putin, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were college buddies. Some of this stuff could fly on the more fringe end of the Tea Party movement, but the pyramid controversy in particular is just much stranger than the kind of stuff that, say, Ted Cruz would embrace. It left the impression that Carson wasn’t just inexperienced or in over his head, but actually a   crank. My personal theory was that his politics have a lot in common with the conspiracism of  ’10 Glenn Beck (though even that doesn’t explain the pyramid thing). But whatever the real explanation, it was a bit much for even base voters to stomach.    It was also not what they were looking for in the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks. Carson’s amateurishness really did become a problem then in a way it hadn’t before. He made blunder after blunder: He said China was intervening in the Syrian civil war (it’s not). He called the San Bernardino attacks a ”hate crime,” explaining, ”Well it’s hard to imagine that you would shoot a bunch of people and not hate them, right?” Even his own advisers thought he was out of his depth. Duane Clarridge, a former CIA operative and Carson adviser, told the New York Times, ”Nobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East.” The big, spectacular collapse of the Carson campaign             And so the campaign went into free fall. Poll numbers plummeted. Internally, havoc ensued. The campaign had raised a decent amount of money, but it was spending much of it on more fundraising, operating more like a pyramid scheme than an actual campaign. Around Christmas, Carson declared that he was shaking up his campaign, before   the same day and saying all was well. His campaign manager, Barry Bennett, first heard of the impending   from an Associated Press reporter. A week later, Bennett and communications director Doug Watts quit the campaign, saying that Carson was only listening to one person: his friend and business manager Armstrong Williams, a conservative columnist previously most famous for taking money from the Bush administration in exchange for favorable columns. Bennett also questioned whether the man whose campaign he ran was qualified for the White House: ”You have to surround yourself with good people,” Bennett said. ”And he hasn’t demonstrated that he can do that. No one wants Armstrong Williams anywhere near the Oval Office.” It appeared that Williams had taken over as Carson’s main adviser, but apparently even that relationship is shaky. The Wednesday before the Iowa caucuses, Carson told reporters that Williams was a habitual liar: ”Armstrong is not necessarily the epitome of truth. He doesn’t speak all things that are correct. He often speaks without thinking. He has no official capacity in the campaign whatsoever. His influence has been vastly overrated.”    Unsurprisingly, a campaign this dysfunctional did not reach the early states with anywhere near the support or organization to finish well. Ultimately, Carson’s campaign resembled Michele Bachmann’s in 2012: a sudden unexpected rise, followed by a sharp fall when it became clear they were not ready for the big leagues.

"Netflix's 'Russian Doll' May Be Perfect, But You Won't Be Satisfied. Of all the shows that have redefined the way we think about television, the most invigorating of them in recent years have been comedies with an existentialist bent. Starting with NBC's The Good Place,1 the subgenre's standouts manage a sort of dual metabolism, punctuating their long-arc ambitions with moments of utter disorientation. Perspectives reset, time doubles back, expectations crash into one another. Things go, in other words, all Jeremy Bearimy. On Netflix's Russian Doll, they do so in the fourth episode. Then again in the sixth episode. And the seventh. And halfway through the eighth and final one. And, of course, the ending itself. The specifics don't warrant discussion, at least here. Spoilers and all. Besides, if you've watched the show, you know the exact points at which whatever you thought you knew vanishes, figuratively or otherwise. What matters is that such moments exist. Because like so many of these comedies, especially those on streaming platforms, Russian Doll deploys them in the cliffhanging cadence of genre fare. Each revelation, each unexplained oddity, serves to reel you back for another installment of your binge. (That they often occur at the beginnings of episodes rather than the ends is just one of the many tiny upheavals of the show.) Whether a frisson or an outright jaw-dropper, each satisfies in its own way. With one possible exception. In the (many, many) conversations I've had about the show since it debuted on Netflix last week, most of them featured a very particular phrase. ""I didn't like the ending."" In case I haven't been explicit enough about it: Russian Doll is far and away the best original new show of the past two years. (Sorry, Homecoming, you're an adaptation!) The story of a woman (Natasha Lyonne) trying to puzzle her way out of a life-death-rinse-repeat loop, it's a perfect polished gem, a purehearted spacetime meditation that has more in common with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind than Groundhog Day. It's about love and betrayal and forgiveness and gentrification. It's recursive and affecting in ways Black Mirror: Bandersnatch wishes it could be. In order to be all those things, it had to kill its own ego—and to jettison any chance it had of making everyone happy when the credits rolled. Nothing new about divisive endings, right? Hospital drama St. Elsewhere ended by implying six seasons had happened inside an autistic kid's snow globe; people were not pleased. Ditto the Seinfeld gang kibitzing into oblivion in a jail cell. And when ""prestige"" TV rolled around, David Chase's Sopranos blackout became the stuff of many a hate thread. But genre TV—especially the ""mystery box"" dramas that began with Lost—changed something. The unsatisfying finale, once the result of a bungled creative choice, became an inevitability.2 Mystery is the perfect carrot for any showrunner, baiting viewers into curiosity, then investment. You want, you need to see exactly how a world is built. You have your own theories—about Walt's special powers or why Hurley and Libby were in the same institution—and they demand some sort of resolution. But while red herrings come with the territory, 121 hours' worth of loose ends can never be tied up; a few will always drag things down. Lost, of course, was a drama, fraught with weighty themes and weightier gazes. Comedies have historically shrugged off those kind of expectations—until they started sailing into deeper waters. The ambition was thrilling: Somebody got utilitarianism in my comedy! Freed of laugh tracks and multiple cameras, writers got into it. Death. Afterlife. Aliens. The search for meaning. Most importantly, it was still funny. This wasn't your grand-Sartre's black-bereted existentialism; this was just being out-there enough to look inward. But with success comes longevity, and with longevity comes the danger. Now four seasons in, The Good Place is up to its interdimensional pancakes in Big Ideas. The show has shunted viewers through an ever-more-ridiculous series of celestial realms and byzantine bylaws, each one explained (or negated) by the next. Yes, that's one of the show's charms; but also yes, each world-building tap dance mortgages the trust of the audience. And holy forking shirtballs, the stakes were already high. Eternity! Redemption! Free will and morality and our responsibility to each other! Comedy may be less onerous, but pontificating about the Way the Universe Works ain't. It's a big sandbox to play in, and the big brains playing in that sandbox are what give The Good Place and Forever and, now, Russian Doll their firepower. But take a step back and you've got all the freedom of comedy being used to shoulder all the weight of—well, philosophy and religion and science. It's a trade-off, and sooner or later one of the two is going to win. Either you whimsy your way into nothingness or you buckle under life, the universe, and everything. The longer you last, the surer the reckoning is. This is the whole point of the single-season show. Construct the world, present the world, and disengage. No ballast, no unredeemable promises. Russian Doll is, as of right now, a shimmering bit of restraint—though with the show reportedly plotted out for three seasons, nothing is guaranteed. If its creators (Leslye Headland and Amy Poehler, along with Lyonne herself) are willing to back away, they'll be leaving it in a near-flawless state: a journey through infinity. And infinity can only be bounded so tightly. Which brings us back to the finale, again. To me, it's satisfying. To me, it hangs together. And if you disagree, that's all the better. The show's success lies in its willingness to take on the Big Ideas and to do so with wit and nuance. Its creators built a world and showed us exactly what it was, with just enough mystery to keep you there. Sometimes, the questions are so big that not everyone likes the answers. 1 Ugh, sorry, I hate footnotes, just wanted to acknowledge that Atlanta, which premiered two weeks before The Good Place, overlaps, if narrowly, with this genre. It may not explicitly wrestle with karmic questions, but its woozy magical realism parks close enough to Russian Doll to scrape side mirrors. 2 Again, sorry, but this really bears mentioning: Reviewing the Lost finale for The Guardian, Charlie Brooker (yes, the creator of Black Mirror) wrote that it ""made less sense than a milk hammock.”",0.0
"Attacker in Nice is said to have radicalized ‘very rapidly’.   NICE, France  —   The man who plowed a truck down a crowded Nice thoroughfare and killed 84 people was a “soldier of the Islamic State,” the militant group said Saturday, as French authorities said the attacker was inspired by terrorist organizations.  It remained unclear whether the Islamic State had directed the attack, was taking responsibility for an assault it inspired or was simply seeking publicity from an event in which it had no direct hand. But no matter the exact connection to organized groups, investigators appear to believe that Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, was taking his cues from their message. The link underscores the difficulty of preventing the spread of extremist ideology in a world where even people like Bouhlel  —   whose family and neighbors portray him as a troubled loner  —   can be spurred to attack without training, resources or connections. “It seems that he radicalized his views very rapidly. These are the first elements that our investigation has come up with through interviews with his acquaintances,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Saturday, without offering details. Five people have been detained for questioning in the case. “We are now facing individuals who are responding positively to the messages issued by the Islamic State without having had any special training and without having access to weapons that allow them to commit mass murder,” Cazeneuve said.     A large truck rammed into a crowd, killing at least 84 people, French officials said. View Graphic     A large truck rammed into a crowd, killing at least 84 people, French officials said.   [Assailant in truck attack had record of petty crime and violence]  The Amaq news agency, which is linked to the Islamic State, cited an “insider source” in declaring that Bouhlel “was a soldier of the Islamic State. ” “He executed the operation in response to calls to target citizens of coalition nations that fight the Islamic State,” the news agency said.  Separately, the Islamic State’s   radio station said Bouhlel used “a new tactic” to wreak havoc. “The crusader countries know that no matter how much they enforce their security measures and procedures, it will not stop the mujahideen from striking,” the station said. But the oblique claim of responsibility left open the question of whether Bouhlel had acted alone or had any prior communication with the group, which has also claimed ties to the attacks that struck Paris twice last year and Brussels in March. French authorities have been scrambling to determine whether Bouhlel had a support network in Nice, where he appeared to have been living for at least six years.  Investigators on Saturday detained three people, including one person thought to have spoken to Bouhlel by phone minutes before he started his deadly journey down Nice’s Promenade des Anglais during Bastille Day celebrations. Another man was detained late Friday, according to the office of Paris prosecutor François Molins, and authorities detained Bouhlel’s   on Friday for questioning.  [What France thinks of multiculturalism and Islam]    The Washington Post’s Michael Birnbaum reports from Nice, France, a day after 84 people were killed when Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel drove a truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. (Michael Birnbaum, Jason   Washington Post)   One focus of the inquiry is Bouhlel’s cellphone, recovered in the cab of the white truck that the   resident of France used to kill 84 people and injure 202. The contacts and call records in the phone can be used to stitch together a portrait of those who may have spoken to Bouhlel in his final days and hours. He was killed by police during the attack. Nice, meanwhile, was trying to return to normal on Saturday by partially reopening the seaside Promenade des Anglais to traffic. Beaches also reopened, creating a jarring contrast between the tourists frolicking in the gentle Mediterranean surf and the   pavement above. Mourners dropped flowers on the spots where people had fallen, a route that stretched for more than a mile.  [Texas father and son among the dead]  In Paris, President François Hollande convened an emergency meeting of his top security advisers to discuss the investigation. “The ideologist of Daesh, Abu Muhammad   has for several weeks been repeating that it was necessary to attack directly, even individually, French people and Americans wherever they are and by whatever means,” said Defense Minister   Le Drian, using an Arabic name for the Islamic State. “Clearly, certain individuals, such as the driver of that truck, individually responded to this call for committing murder. ” “Even if Daesh doesn’t do the organizing, Daesh inspires a terrorist spirit against which we are organizing,” he said. The attack has put the deeply unpopular Hollande on the defensive.   opposition politicians have pressed hard over his handling of security and terrorism. Christian Estrosi, the   president of the regional council of    d’Azur, which includes Nice, wrote in an open letter Saturday that he had asked two weeks ago for additional security during the Bastille Day celebrations. National authorities had turned down the request, he said, because there was no “special alert. ” But Hollande and his allies have rejected any notion that they erred in their security assessments. “We are at a moment where there are temptations to divide our country,” said Hollande spokesman Stéphane Le Foll. Cazeneuve said authorities had foiled terror plots connected to the European soccer championships that concluded a week ago. Late Saturday, he urged “all French patriots” to join the national reserve, a measure of the sharp personnel need as French leaders scramble to get more security forces onto streets. As authorities worked to determine whether Bouhlel was connected to a wider extremist network, an emerging portrait of the killer on Saturday suggested that he was a troubled and isolated man, never fully at home in any of the places, communities and families he had known. Bouhlel had “psychological problems that caused a nervous breakdown,” his father told French television in comments broadcast Saturday. “He would become angry, shout, break everything around him,” Mohamed Mondher Lahouaiej Bouhlel said in the family home town of Msaken, about 75 miles south of Tunis. “We had to take him to the doctor. ” Bouhlel’s arrival in France in 2009 or 2010  —   his father could not recall the exact year  —   did not appear to have given him any peace or stability. He built a rap sheet for petty theft and assault. Although he married and had children, he allegedly beat his wife until she threw him out of their apartment in a   complex on the north side of Nice, according to neighbors. After the split with his wife, he found an apartment in Nice’s Abattoirs area, a   district named after the city’s former slaughterhouse. It was on an anonymous thoroughfare in a peeling building next to a string of empty storefronts and parking lots. Neighbors there said they were afraid of Bouhlel. Jasmin Corman, 38, said he had “fixed eyes” that terrified her and her two children, 14 and 7. “He was always alone,” she said. Standing in the doorway of her apartment on the building’s ground floor  —   directly below Bouhlel’s   apartment  —   she recounted on Saturday how he recently stood on the stairwell and silently stared at her as she was locking her door. “It’s horrifying to realize you were living beneath a murderer,” she said. Corman, a Muslim who observes Ramadan, said that throughout the Muslim month of fasting, Bouhlel smoked and drank, occasionally returning to the building smelling of alcohol. For Muslims, such behaviors are strictly taboo. She also noticed him outside the building with a young blonde on more than one occasion. “It was not his daughter. There were caresses,” she said. Rebab Bouhlel, his sister, said her brother rarely called home to Tunisia but had begun to do so more often recently. “Over the past month,” she told Reuters, “he was calling us every day and he sent us money. ” “He called several times a day,” she said. According to Tunisian media, one of those calls was made the day of the attack. Bouhlel reportedly called his brother to tell him about his troubles, mostly his divorce. Soon, he said, he planned to return to Tunisia.  Rick Noack and Annabell Van den Burghe in Nice and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed to this report.

"Netflix and Marvel’s Iron Fist is an ill-conceived, poorly written disaster.  On Friday, Marvel and Netflix unleashed 13 episodes of the first season of Iron Fist upon the world  —   and it is the single worst thing the superhero television factory has ever created.     This series takes everything good Marvel has done on a joy ride, then returns it scratched, bruised, and smelling like patchouli and broken promises. After the   slog, I’m not angry  —   I’m just disappointed.   Rating                                                  Disappointed, but not particularly surprised. After all, from concept to release, Iron Fist has been a challenge. Iron Fist isn’t really one of Marvel’s most compelling heroes. And the original source material is clunky and full of Asian stereotypes  —   dragons, Orientalist flourishes, and Fu Manchu facial hair. Prior to Iron Fist’s casting of Finn Jones as the title character, there was a fan movement to get Marvel to cast Danny Rand as an Asian or   man. But even if Marvel did that, and even if it managed to perfect the depictions of Asian people on this show, Iron Fist would still be awful.      Iron Fist’s biggest weakness is its writing The story of Iron Fist, a. k. a Danny Rand  —   a rich white man (and orphan) who learns   arts and returns home to fight evil  —   isn’t unlike that of Batman, Green Arrow, or Doctor Strange, putting the onus on the show to do something interesting with a   narrative. The show is also the last of Marvel’s core four Netflix solo series leading up to its     show The Defenders, meaning Iron Fist is tasked with a lot of   place setting for that series. And perhaps the biggest challenge facing Iron Fist in 2017 is that the source material, written in the ’70s, is rife with Orientalist stereotypes, making fans, especially those of Asian descent, wary of what Marvel would do with Iron Fist.     Thankfully, Netflix’s Iron Fist tones down the ’  stereotypes  —   though any writer working in television in 2017 should be able to recognize the comics’ racial hangups, so that’s not saying much. But there’s still the nagging problem that most of the people of color on the series, save Rosario Dawson’s Claire Temple, are affiliated with the bad guys.              The bigger challenge facing the show’s writers was taking the Iron Fist narrative and making it both digestible and distinct, which they’ve utterly failed to do. The most consistently disappointing and distracting Iron Fist element is its flat, repetitive writing. Here’s how a typical Iron Fist conversation goes:      CHARACTER 1: You did [insert something that the audience just saw happen]. CHARACTER 2: I did [the thing character 1 is talking about]. CHARACTER 1: That’s a bad idea that you [did that thing]. CHARACTER 2: I am this thing that did that thing. This is what I’m feeling right now.   Repeat that over and over, and you’ve basically got yourself one season of Iron Fist. On multiple occasions in any given episode, characters will just say plainly how they feel. Half of the first part of the season is Danny Rand saying, “I can explain,” over and over, to the point where it begins to feel like a threat.  The clunky dialogue often creates the sense that the show doesn’t trust its audience. After Danny gets into a fight at Rand HQ, the camera lingers on the head security guard. Later in the episode, the same security guard pursues Danny, and he exclaims, “Hey, you’re that security guard from earlier!” as if we’d somehow forgotten what’s happened in the last 20 minutes.    But perhaps that’s the thing: No character on this show seems to remember what just happened.  Joy Meachum (Jessica Stroup) is Danny’s childhood friend, and her position at Rand Enterprises makes her one of the series’ more intriguing characters. But her decisions never make sense for her character, whether she’s being happy that Danny Rand has returned, then promptly stuffing him into a mental institution, or distrusting and   her sinister family, and ultimately consulting the Hand. Joy is supposed to be a brittle ice queen, but like many of the characters on this show, she feels more like a collection of icy actions than an actual person.  Jessica Henwick’s Colleen Wing suffers from the same inconsistency. One minute she’s fully weighing the consequences of helping Rand. Later, we find out she’s been battling in underground cage matches while teaching teens the balance of restraint in martial arts. The next minute, she’s spouting off about the samurai way of life, and is really down with killing people. Iron Fist doesn’t really understand how to use Wing in a way that makes sense.  These actors aren’t bad  —   Stroup and Henwick are actually really good in this series  —   but they’re not in charge of writing their mangled characters. Maybe they should be.  The fight choreography is aggressively uninteresting When I first watched Daredevil’s first season, I was taken by how the show’s fight scenes had a language of their own. Each character fought differently: Matt Murdock, a. k. a. Daredevil, had an acrobatic precision to his style, which contrasted with Wilson Fisk’s brutish, raw power. In the second season, the series developed this language even further, with Elektra’s agile style and Punisher’s brutal violence. The series’ visual style reflected this dynamism, experimenting with heights and angles in fight scenes to great effect. Sadly, there’s absolutely none of that in Iron Fist.     Granted, there’s also a lack of great fight choreography in Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, the two Netflix solo series preceding Iron Fist, but those shows aren’t centered on martial arts and acrobatic fighting the way Iron Fist is. The fights here look generic, to the point where if you told me they were actually footage from the ’90s Power Rangers series, I would believe you.  Everyone fights the same, and no one looks interesting doing it.            Some of this can be attributed to Danny Rand’s lack of mask or bandana. Thanks to Daredevil’s costuming, a stunt person could step in for actor Charlie Cox, providing the show the freedom to visually experiment. Meanwhile, Iron Fist’s action sequences want to make clear that we’re actually seeing Finn Jones doing some of the punching. But the drawback to that verisimilitude is that the scenes feel choppy and redundant  —   a style Marvel should be long past at this point. A slapdash assassin tournament midway through the season makes it especially evident how the series uses its fight scenes like a cudgel instead of a paintbrush.  Iron Fist feels more like setup for the Hand than a show about a superhero  What makes Iron Fist feel like a conceptual failure is that it’s simply a piece of Marvel’s grand plan to assemble its Netflix shows into The Defenders series, rather than a show intended to showcase its hero. At its best in the comic books, the Iron Fist narrative is about the family Rand builds, the legacy of Iron Fists before him, and the destiny he can’t evade. But it’s hard to get at all those points in this series when there’s so much else it has to set up on the way to Defenders. There’s a set path for the Marvel’s solo Netflix shows to converge, bringing together a villain (the Hand) recurring characters (Jeri Hogarth and Claire Temple) and potential crossovers with existing characters (Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Jessica and Matt Murdock via Hogarth). By the time Iron Fist came around, it needed to be massaged and finessed to fit the missing pieces of this   puzzle. It was constructed backward.  Iron Fist is, for better or worse, handcuffed to the Hand in a way that Jessica Jones and Luke Cage weren’t. Those two series could have more freedom with their villains and storytelling. Iron Fist, by contrast, is chained to a story intended to establish the importance and complexity of the Hand, the villainous   organization from the second season of Daredevil (one of that series’ more successful concepts). Iron Fist reveals that the Hand is a   entity, whose tentacles (fingers?) reach into powerful places.     It’s also capable of a kind of brainwashing.  In the latter half of the season, we find out the Hand resurrected Harold Meachum (David Wenham) Danny’s father’s     shady business partner, through some kind of dark magic. When he returns, he’s more violent and aggressive, with a significant, dangerous debt owed to the Hand. We don’t know how many people aside from Harold and Elektra (who underwent a similar process at the end of Daredevil’s second season) have been resurrected in this manner, and it raises the question of just how many Hand replacements are currently installed in powerful places.  It’s a riveting reveal that sets up the inevitable Defenders showdown and expands on the Hand’s (and to some extent, the Meachums’) origin story of an ancient organization adapting and growing in power in modern times. The problem: It’s a better arc than the one afforded to Iron Fist’s titular hero.   Iron Fist is almost entirely without merit. Almost.  Watching the entire season of Iron Fist left me at the crossroads of fatigue and boredom. I went into this show a young, spry man. I left with arthritis and a pocket full of Werther’s Originals.  At multiple points, I yelled at my screen because another character told us something we just saw happen. And somewhere around episode eight, Jones’s moribund performance led me to Google “handsome actors martial arts training. ” (I then found myself on a Cam Gigandet Pinterest board.)             But within Iron Fist’s relentless mediocrity, there are a couple of lone bright spots. They go by the names of Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) and Jeri Hogarth (  Moss) both previously introduced into the   television universe in prior series. Here, they’re sardonic voices of reason, pragmatic figures to help Danny Rand understand the cynicism and the way the world around him (which he’s been removed from for 15 years) works.  A lot of my affection for these two comes from their constant undercutting of the people around them. Like a salty Greek chorus, Jeri and Claire repeatedly sharpen their faces and give Danny and Colleen a “you’ve got to be kidding me” stare that captures all the annoyance and frustration the viewer is feeling at their antics. Or, because this is a poorly written show, sometimes they give that stare and then actually say, “You’ve got to be kidding me!”     This might be the fatigue talking, but Marvel should really think about a spinoff for these two. It couldn’t be any worse than the 13 hours I just watched.  ",-1.0

"Verizon plans bid to buy Yahoo’s Web business, sources say.  Verizon Communications plans to make a   bid for Yahoo’s Web business next week and is willing to acquire the company’s Yahoo Japan stake to help sweeten the offer, according to people familiar with the matter. Google, the main division of Alphabet, is also considering bidding for Yahoo’s core business, a separate person said. Potential suitors AT&T and Comcast have decided against bidding, some of the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions aren’t public. Microsoft, which failed with a hostile bid for Yahoo in 2008, will not bid this time, another person said. Time Inc. is still evaluating a bid, while   funds Bain and TPG  —   among others  —   are also planning to make a run at the business, either alone or by backing a strategic acquirer, the people said. While the buyout firms haven’t yet paired themselves with a strategic buyer, they are open to the idea of doing so, the people said.   bids for the company’s main Web assets are due April 11, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. Yahoo shares fell about 1. 3 percent in regular trading on Thursday, but they rose in   trading. Verizon and its AOL subsidiary are working with at least three financial advisers on the Yahoo bid, said three of the people. Hiring so many banks is a sign that Verizon is serious about its takeover plans  —   it has said since late last year that it was interested in buying some or all of Yahoo. Verizon, which has a market value of about $213 billion, could give the Yahoo Japan stake to its shareholders or sell it, one of the people said. Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif. would prefer to sell its 35. 5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $8. 5 billion, along with the core business, Bloomberg News reported last month. The valuation of the combined assets would make it more difficult for   firms to finance a bid for both parts. Representatives of Yahoo, AT&T, Comcast, Time, TPG and Verizon declined to comment. Representatives of Bain and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Verizon values Yahoo’s core business at less than $8 billion, one of the people said. Verizon, as well as some   firms, met with Microsoft last month to talk about potential funding for a bid, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Microsoft has not committed any funding and is unlikely to provide anything more than a token investment to the winning bidder, one of the people said. A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment. Yahoo’s projected revenue will drop almost 15 percent and earnings by more than 20 percent for 2016, according to a slide deck it released to potential bidders,   reported Wednesday. Verizon would replace Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer with AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong and Marni Walden, Verizon’s executive vice president, who would run a combined Yahoo and AOL, two of the people said. Japan’s SoftBank Group has always had tepid interest in buying Yahoo, two of the people said. So far, discussions have centered around Yahoo Japan, in which SoftBank is the majority shareholder, paying a reduced licensing fee to Yahoo. The two sides are in active discussions to lower this fee, which stands at 3 percent of gross revenue, before any deal to sell Yahoo is announced. Yahoo Japan has argued the fee is too high because Yahoo hasn’t invested in technology the Asian company can use, causing the brand to suffer, one of the people said. A representative of SoftBank declined to comment. Yahoo said it would explore strategic alternatives, including selling its main Internet operations, earlier this year after scrapping a   plan to spin off its valuable Asian assets. The company’s stock has declined about 20 percent in the past 12 months as turnaround efforts led by Yahoo’s Mayer have stalled and sales have sagged, leaving the company vulnerable to activist investors. Last month, Chief Financial Officer Ken Goldman said the board committee working on a possible sale of the core operations is “more active than anyone can possibly believe. ” Activist Starboard Value, a longtime Yahoo critic, said in March it was fed up with the Web portal’s leadership and called for the board to be replaced. The activist fund, which recently increased its Yahoo holdings to 1. 7 percent, said the board has failed to deliver results. The current board cannot be trusted to weigh the options that will best serve investors, and it’s important for the activist fund to be involved to ensure a “full and fair sale process,” according to a letter from Starboard chief executive Jeffrey Smith. Smith has put his own name in as one of the hedge fund’s director nominees to the board.  —   Bloomberg News    ",-0.5
"The Global Hawk Drone Iran Shot Down Was a $220M Surveillance Monster. Early Thursday morning, Iran shot down a United States unmanned aerial vehicle over the Strait of Hormuz, which runs between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Iran identified the drone as an RQ-4A Global Hawk, a $220 million UAV that acts as a massive surveillance platform in the sky. The attack marks an escalation with tensions already running high between the US and Iran—particularly because of the value and technical sensitivity of the downed drone. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said on Thursday that the Northrup Grumman-made Global Hawk—part of a multibillion-dollar program that dates back to 2001—had entered Iranian airspace and crashed in Iranian waters; US Central Command confirmed the time and general location of the attack, but insists that the drone was flying in international airspace.

"New York’s leaders are still failing on ethics reform. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature’s leaders are oh so proud of their   state budget  —   yet there’s not a word in it about ethics reform. This as former legislative leaders Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos await sentencing after their landmark convictions for abuse of their offices. And after countless other lawmakers have headed off to prison in recent years. And after the Legislature failed to deliver on its No. 1 reform promise last year  —   to get the ball rolling on amending the state constitution to strip pensions from   like Silver and Skelos. Now comes a new Quinnipiac Poll showing that 86 percent of New Yorkers say corruption in Albany is a serious problem. So serious, in fact, that 48 percent said  current elected officials should be voted out of office so new officials can start with a clean slate. And 48 percent also see Cuomo as “part of the problem. ” Senate Republicans made one move on their own, setting term limits for the majority leader and committee chairs. As for anything larger, well: Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan say they’ll try to enact  before the session ends in June  —   but don’t hold your breath. Heastie, after all, failed to deliver on that constitutional amendment after the Senate did its part  —   and neither Flanagan nor Cuomo forced him to make good. Actually, the Legislature  address corruption in the budget  —   by quietly inserting an added $385 million in discretionary spending for unspecified projects. That’s basically a legislative slush fund  —   much like the one that was central to Silver’s kickback scheme. Back in January, Heastie assured New Yorkers he was “serious about ethics reform” and understood that “words are simply not enough. ” So far, though, words are all New York’s getting from any of its leaders.",1.0
"Abolish the National Endowment for the Arts.  Although the National Endowment for the Arts’ 2016 cost of $148 million was less than   of 1 percent of the federal budget, attempting to abolish the NEA is a fight worth having, never mind the certain futility of the fight.  Let’s pretend, counterfactually, that the NEA no longer funds the sort of rubbish that once immersed it in the culture wars, e. g. “Piss Christ” (a photograph depicting a crucifix immersed in a jar of the artist’s urine) and “Genital Wallpaper” (don’t ask). What, however, is art? We subsidize soybean production, but at least we can say what soybeans are. Are NEA enthusiasts serene about government stipulating, as it must, art’s public purposes that justify public funding? Or do they insist that public funds should be expended for no defined public purpose? Government breeds advocacy groups that lobby it to do what it wants to do anyway  —   expand what it is doing. The myriad entities with financial interests in preserving the NEA cloyingly call themselves the “arts community,” a clever branding that other grasping factions should emulate, e. g. the “  community. ” The “arts community” has its   down pat. The rhetorical cotton candy  —   sugary,   arts gush  —   asserts that the arts nurture “civically valuable dispositions” and a sense of “community and connectedness. ” And, of course, “diversity” and “ . ” Americans supposedly suffer from a scarcity of both. The NEA was created in 1965 as a filigree on the Great Society. In 1995, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives and said the NEA was a frill the federal government should be shorn of.   years later, it survives, having mastered adaptive evolution,  : It defines art democratically and circularly. Art is anything done by anyone calling himself or herself an artist, and an artist is anyone who produces art. An NEA report issued under President Bill Clinton said “art includes the expressive behaviors of ordinary people,” including “  arrangements” and “  designs. ” As Walt Whitman neglected to say, “I hear America singing, and everyone’s singing is above average. ” Populist pandering is nothing new in Washington. Neither is this utilitarian calculus: Policies are good that provide the greatest   for the greatest number.  David Marcus, artistic director of a   theater project and senior contributor to the Federalist, says the NEA produces “perverse market incentives” that explain why many arts institutions “are failing badly at reaching new audiences, and losing ground”: “Many theater companies, even the country’s most ‘successful,’ get barely 50 percent of their revenue from ticket sales. Much of the rest comes from   donations and direct government grants. This means that the real way to succeed as an arts organization is not to create a product that attracts new audiences, but to create a product that pleases those who dole out the free cash. The industry received more free money than it did a decade ago, and has fewer attendees. ” Furthermore, the NEA’s effects are regressive, funding programs that are, as Paul D. Ryan’s ( .) House Budget Committee said, “generally enjoyed by people of   levels, making them a wealth transfer from poorer to wealthier. ” A frequently cited study purporting to prove otherwise was meretricious: It stressed income levels of Zip codes where   institutions are, inferring that institutions located in   areas are serving   people.  Defense contractors spread weapons systems’ subcontracts across the nation like butter across toast; 50 states and perhaps all 435 congressional districts get NEA funds. And here is another reason for the immortality of government programs: If a program is a major expense, its spending generates so many dependent clients that legislators flinch from eliminating or even substantially trimming it. And if a program is, like the NEA, a minor expense, legislators wonder: Why take the trouble, and experience the pain (the NEA’s affluent clients fluently articulate their grievances and sense of entitlement) for a trivial gain? Americans’ voluntary contributions to arts organizations (“  ” institutions reaped $17 billion in 2015) dwarf the NEA’s subventions, which would be replaced if those who actually use the organizations  —   many of them supported by state and local government arts councils  —   were as enthusiastic about them as they claim to be. The idea that the arts will wither away if the NEA goes away is risible. Distilled to its essence, the argument for the NEA is: Art is a Good Thing, therefore a government subsidy for it is a Good Deed. To appreciate the non sequitur, substitute “macaroni and cheese” for “art. ”  Read more from George F. Will’s archive or follow him on Facebook.    Read more here:   George F.

"A charity’s radical experiment: giving 6,000 Kenyans enough money to escape poverty for a decade.  GiveDirectly, a charity that gives money directly to poor people in Kenya and Uganda, is launching a big new project: a basic income.    A basic income  —   also called a universal basic income (UBI) guaranteed minimum income, citizens’ dividend, demogrant, etc.  —   is a regular payment to a group of people just for being alive. Normally, basic income proposals call for the payments to be administered by the government, but there’s nothing in principle stopping a nonprofit like GiveDirectly from doing it. So it’s giving the policy a shot, and will give about 6, 000 people in Kenya a guaranteed flow of cash for the next 10 years or more. In doing so, GiveDirectly is testing out an idea that’s rapidly gaining interest in Finland, Silicon Valley, and Ontario, Canada, and could radically transform welfare policy in both rich and poor countries in the future. More than that, it’s creating what is perhaps the first true universal basic income in recorded history. There have been previous policies that are at least somewhat like this. But GiveDirectly’s introduction of a universal payment for whole villages over a long, long period, set at a level of basic subsistence, is truly historic.    How GiveDirectly plans to launch its basic income      GiveDirectly currently uses   and MTN,   payment systems popular in East Africa, to distribute big   payments to desperately poor people in Kenya and Uganda. So far, it’s gotten results: A randomized evaluation of the charity found that recipients ate more and experienced less hunger, invested in expensive but worthwhile assets like iron roofs and farm animals, and reported higher psychological  . They were less hungry, richer, and   happier.    For its basic income project, the group will randomly select dozens of villages in Kenya (it already has a specific region selected) with about 6, 000 people in them total and, starting at the end of this year, provide every current resident with a basic income for the next 10 years, potentially continuing even after that. The group is still finalizing details, but the payment is expected to be about $0. 70 to $1. 10 per person per day. It will likely vary from village to village to allow for more testing. More than 15, 000 people total will get some form of cash transfer from the project, including the 6, 000 getting a full UBI. While $250 to $400 a year is a pittance by US standards, it’s as much as or more than the recipients ordinarily make annually. ”These recipients are some of the most vulnerable people in the world, living on the U. S. equivalent of less than a dollar a day,” GiveDirectly   Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus write.    The group is planning to randomize which villages get the grant and which will serve as ”controls.” That lets the project double as an experiment generating scientifically valid results about what basic income policies do when implemented over the long run for entire villages. GiveDirectly is bringing in MIT economist Abhijit Banerjee, a   of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab ( ) and one of the   development economists in the world, to run the evaluation. Also involved is Albert Wenger, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures and an angel investor in companies like Etsy and Tumblr, who’s donating to the effort. GiveDirectly expects results well before the 10 years are up. Even within a year or two, consumption patterns and other behavior will likely change in the villages getting the UBI, in large part because participants know the payments will continue for the foreseeable future. That will likely lead to planning and work shifts that wouldn’t take place in a temporary trial. What makes the GiveDirectly experiment different GiveDirectly’s is one of at least five basic income studies happening at the moment. The Dutch city of Utrecht is currently giving some existing welfare recipients a basic income instead of their usual benefit package, Finland is planning a   trial testing of a variety of different basic income approaches, the Silicon Valley investment firm Y Combinator is funding an experiment, and the government of Ontario is doing a pilot too.    But the GiveDirectly study could prove to be the most important and informative of the bunch. Unlike every study to date, which lasted a few years at most, GiveDirectly’s basic income will be paid out for a decade or more. The plan is to raise $30 million in initial capital for the experiment. As this chart from GiveDirectly points out, the only   basic income —  like payout to be studied to date is a casino dividend paid by the Eastern Band of Cherokees, which is obviously a rather different situation; it also wasn’t a randomized experiment, limiting its power:              The trial is also unusual in being truly universal. The American basic income trials targeted existing welfare recipients; they weren’t available to everyone in the community. Same for the current trial in Utrecht. The Y Combinator trial sounds like it won’t target a certain geographic area but rather a set number of people chosen at random, which would similarly limit its ability to test the policy’s effects on an entire community. The GiveDirectly basic income would be truly universal, providing an opportunity to see   effects and macroeconomic changes. The GiveDirectly study also stands out for targeting a developing country. There’s been some studies on basic incomes in poor nations, notably a   effort in Namibia and a trial by veteran basic income advocate Guy Standing in India, but most past experiments were conducted in rich countries. That’s somewhat perverse, as the combination of a dramatically lower poverty line and the availability of   aid funds makes basic income more sustainable and affordable in developing countries than in rich ones. What GiveDirectly is hoping to learn      While basic income itself has not been studied much in poor countries, cash transfers in general definitely have. There’s a large empirical literature on cash transfer programs now, and the results are very positive, with various studies finding that just handing out money increases consumption, encourages investments in important assets like metal roofs, encourages more people to start working, boosts earnings, and doesn’t lead to more spending on things like alcohol or tobacco. This had led to a quiet cash revolution in development circles, as aid agencies, nonprofits, and the like have become considerably more sympathetic to cash as an intervention and new charities devoted to cash grants, like GiveDirectly, have gained ground. And it’s led to a proliferation of ”conditional cash transfer” programs in poor and   countries, which like basic incomes provide a steady stream of cash to poor households but unlike them require recipients to do certain beneficial activities (get vaccinated, send their kids to school, etc. ). So what’s the additional benefit of studying basic income, if we know so much about cash in general? One reason, Faye says, is the ”income” piece of things. So far, GiveDirectly has focused on doing   payments rather than recurring ones. This has some obvious disadvantages relative to the regular payments of a basic income, which allow recipients to spread out their spending, ease the mental strain of saving and budgeting, provide a safety net in case things go wrong, etc. There’s a reason people tend to prefer regular paychecks to one big check every year.    But   payments also have a lot going for them. For one thing, they’re less paternalistic. Regular basic income payments assume that recipients need the government to ration out access to money, that they can’t be trusted with a big, massive grant all at once, even if that grant is the same size as the total basic income checks they’d get. More importantly from GiveDirectly’s perspective,   transfers could be more effective at spurring actual development. The cash transfer research has tended to find that cash grants have high rates of return. That is, people getting the money also increase their income from business and agriculture, multiplying the money’s impact. GiveDirectly’s   grants, averaging $707, produced about $200 more in business and agriculture income, for a rate of return of 28 percent. A recent randomized study in Uganda got rates of return to cash of 30 to 49 percent. That raises the stakes on the     debate. If the rate of return on basic income is equal to, or lower than, the return for   payments, then that would seem to suggest you could generate more economic growth, faster, by just giving poor people all the money at once. If you give someone $5, 000 all at once rather than  $350 a year, then you’ll get more returns earlier. But you have to weigh that against the other benefits of paying as income: insurance against future poverty, lower mental stress, etc. The GiveDirectly study will enable Banerjee and the rest of the evaluation team to weigh those factors. Faye also says the experiment plans on giving at least some participants a choice between a   and regular payment, in part to gauge which they’d prefer. The results should provide a great lens into this particular question, and help clarify whether cash programs should aim to get as much money out as possible, as quickly as possible, or if regular payments are preferable.  Here’s a simple solution to poverty    ",-1.0
"Meet DxOMark, the Kingmaker of Smartphone Cameras. Before Mario Queiroz, Google’s VP of Product Management, stepped on stage to announce the Pixel 2 earlier this month, a video presented attendees with the question: “What if smartphones got smarter and simpler?” As he talked about the company’s flagship phone, it became clear the question didn't refer to the phone’s blazing fast processor, its crisp, high-resolution display, or the water-resistant design—all good smartphones today have all that. So instead, Queiroz and other Google execs spent much of their stage time talking about how they improved the Pixel 2’s camera. While phones like the iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, and Galaxy Note 8 pack dual-lens setups to do all sorts of funky stuff like depth-sensing and optical zoom, Google’s new phone uses machine learning to make pictures look great.

"Dirty attack ad could backfire in Georgia’s high-profile 6th District race.           The Atlanta   reports: Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel strongly condemned an attack ad that surfaced Sunday accusing the “unhinged left” of endorsing violence against Republicans days before the   race to represent Georgia’s 6th District is decided. The ad, funded by a   group called the Principled PAC, opens with sounds of gunshots and footage of U. S. Rep. Steve Scalise being wheeled away on a stretcher after he and other members of the Republican congressional baseball team were ambushed by a lone gunman while practicing in a Washington suburb. “The man is fighting for his life,” Ossoff said Sunday after a campaign stop. “I think it’s disgraceful to politicize it, and I think Secretary Handel should call for it to come down. ” For reasons that perplex many onlookers, a Handel spokeswoman did not call for the ad to be taken down, and merely called it “disturbing and disgusting. ” As a moral and political matter, this seems to be a poor move that underestimates public disgust with vitriol and the politicization of violence. Handel’s refusal to issue a   denunciation and demand for the ad to be taken down comes across as a   to the far right. In a district filled with upscale, highly educated voters whose rising discontent with President Trump has fueled Ossoff’s rise, Handel’s halfhearted approach may only remind voters that she willingly campaigned with Trump and has refused to repudiate his policies. Moreover, a final tweet from Trump backing her candidacy might do as much harm as good in the race. It’s not clear whether this final incident will make a difference in Tuesday’s highly anticipated special election, which has already beaten all spending records for a congressional district race and generated a stampede of early voters. Nevertheless, in a close race, as this is expected to be, virtually any event can tip the scales. Should Ossoff win, Republicans on the ballot in 2018 (or considering retirement) will get a jolt. If a congressional district that Tom Price won by 23 points in 2016 goes to a Democrat in a race with a candidate who failed to distance herself from Trump and his policies and didn’t do her utmost to repudiate egregious rhetoric, you can bet that there will be more congressmen and senators willing to rebuke Trump and distance themselves from his policies. In the   race, one poll shows more than 80 percent of voters consider health care the top issue; a loss for the GOP in that setting will set off a round of   about Trumpcare. Watch for the Republicans in competitive seats who decide to retire, a sure sign of flagging optimism about the party’s chances. Should Handel win, Democrats will try to reassure one another that this is a “9. ” Republican district  —   far more Republican than tens of districts that could be in play in 2018. Nevertheless, a loss here for Democrats would likely set off a new round of recriminations. Does the party need a stronger, affirmative message? Would it do better with candidates to the left of a centrist like Ossoff? In sum, the   won’t necessarily be predictive of 2018. However, in the short run, it’s likely to dominate the political discussion at exactly the same time the Senate is contemplating a secretive, rushed process on health care. If nothing else, it may determine just how many Republicans decide to hang it up before the next election.",-0.5

Saturday’s game was the first in eight contests that Thornwell, who missed a day of practice with a fever this week, did not lead his team in scoring after averaging 25. 8 points through the first four games of the tournament.   ✅ Advance to title game✅ Get drenched✅ Do handstand#FinalFour #UnitedWeZag pic. twitter.   —   NCAA March Madness (@marchmadness) April 2, 2017       comes out of Zags locker room screaming: ”They were saying we can’t shoot threes!

The Gamecocks’ top scorer, Sindarius Thornwell, went all but three minutes without a field goal and South Carolina shot just 37 percent from the floor to Gonzaga’s 58 percent, yet the Gamecocks kept things close for most of the half until Zach Collins’ jumper sparked the Bulldogs’ late run. Gonzaga’s leading scorer Nigel   leads all players with 12 points on    shooting from the floor, and did a remarkable job holding Thornwell, the SEC Player of the Year, without a basket for much of the half. The main drama came when Gonzaga’s Przemek Karnowski left the game after getting poked in the eye  —   no foul was called  —   and the Zags outscored the Gamecocks   while he was sidelined.

"Google Holds Its Big Pixel Event Tomorrow. Here's What's at Stake. You'd think having dominated search and email, created Chrome and YouTube, plus a self-driving car project, a handful of save-the-world enterprises, and the greatest advertising business in the history of the universe would be enough to keep Google busy. You certainly wouldn't think the folks in Mountain View would suddenly feel the urge to get into the smartphone game, a remarkably mature market where nobody but Samsung and Apple makes any money, and where Google's already ubiquitous thanks to Android. And yet, tomorrow, Google will reportedly launch the next generation of its smartphone with the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL. At the same time, the company will reportedly introduce a new Chrome OS-based laptop called the Pixelbook, a small smart speaker called the Google Home Mini, and new hardware for the Daydream VR platform. The announcements come on the heels of Google's $1.1 billion acqui-hire of 2,000 HTC engineers, who will help Google make more hardware, more quickly. Right or wrong, smart or stupid, Google's a hardware company now. Of course, Google's made hardware for a long time. The Nexus team built phones; the Pixel team worked on Chromebooks, tablets, and then also phones. The Ara team, within Google's ATAP division, built its own sort of phones. Another team worked on Chromecast, another on Google Wi-Fi, another on the Daydream View. Remember the Nexus Q set-top-box-doorstep thing? That was Google. All these products had the same goal: to show developers and users how good Google's software could be, running on the right hardware. But they were small-time, limited-run products that rarely led to market-wide innovation. In 2016, something finally clicked, and Google took its fate more firmly into its own hands. As they say, hardware is hard. It's a ruthless and low-margin business, but it's also an important one. Building gadgets in-house gives Google an opportunity to assert itself beyond what any of its partners can offer. More importantly, it gives Google a chance to control its destiny in an increasingly uncertain time. ""As new technologies spin out of mobile, Google wants to make sure its own high-end hardware highlights that—whether it’s Assistant or Daydream or Tango, even the Internet of Things,"" says Avi Greengart, a devices and platforms analyst for GlobalData. ""Google needs Samsung, it likes Samsung, but as the platform driver it doesn’t want to be entirely dependent on Samsung."" Depending on Samsung is a dangerous game. Galaxy products are the most popular Android phones by far, and the prime iPhone competition. But every year, you can feel Samsung leaning a little further away from Google. It built the Bixby assistant, which competes directly with Google Assistant, and gave Bixby prime placement on its phones. Samsung builds its own browser, email client, and messaging app, which seem utterly redundant unless Samsung's trying to wean its reliance on Google products. Samsung mostly eschews Daydream in favor of Gear VR, and has a home-grown smart-home platform competing directly with Nest, Android Things, and all the other Google connected-home products. Over the last few years, Samsung's been hammering away at Tizen, its own operating system, which already runs on the company's wearables. Save for the Play Store's un-replicable app selection, Samsung barely needs Android at all. Soon enough, Android's power might wane for everyone else as well. New platforms like Amazon's Alexa pose something of an existential threat to Google. Alexa can give you directions through Google Maps, or another mapping app. You can listen to Google Play Music, or Spotify. If you buy an Echo, you might someday never use Google, and you might not even notice. Google could go to the HTCs and LGs of the world, build phones and speakers with them, and try to grow competitors in the wild. Except that doesn't work—Google's been trying for years with the Nexus program to inspire and convince others to build better, cleaner, more powerful Android phones, but everybody just keeps buying Galaxies. So that's the danger in not making hardware. There's also opportunity in doing so. Just look at Apple, which spent the last decade taking the idea of vertical integration to its extreme. It doesn't just design and assemble its own phones, it's also responsible for many of the most important parts inside. By any measure, the latest crop of iPhones are the most powerful smartphones on the market, thanks to Apple's own A11 Bionic processor. As other companies converge on identical performance metrics, commoditizing a ""Good Phone,"" Apple's jumped to a whole different level. That's why its augmented-reality tech works so well, why its cameras are consistently the best on the market, and even enables minor-but-crucial things like rock-solid Bluetooth connection. As the next phase of tech comes into the market, that kind of power and control become even more important. ""Tiny EarPods, Smart Watches, Augmented Reality, Adaptive Acoustics require wrapping your arms around all parts of the problem,"" the analyst Horace Dediu wrote recently. ""The integration and control it demands are in contrast to the modular approach of assembling off-the-shelf components into a good-enough configuration."" Think about the next version of Google Glass (or whatever non-flashback-inducing new name Google gives its face-puter). Making that work will require highly specific work in batteries, processors, screens, cameras, and more. The off-the-shelf version looks like, well, Glass. The custom version, built in-house and in tandem with the software, firmware, and wireless teams at Google, could be much better. Right now, the company's making a smartphone for the same reason Andy Rubin's Essential started with a smartphone, the same reason anyone talks themselves into entering this preposterously huge market: It's the most important device anyone owns. Google seems to believe it's big and popular enough that it can wedge its foot in the door of the market, and at least take a piece of the high-end smartphone universe. But that's actually the easy part—the last Pixel was great, and HTC made it. The real reason to take everything internal is to be able to control and improve what comes after. Saying ""we're a hardware company!"" and actually becoming a successful one are two radically different enterprises, though. That HTC group Google just bought? They've made great phones for a decade, but thanks to some bad carrier-exclusivity decisions and a truly terrible marketing plan, its products stayed under the radar. (Meanwhile, Samsung's marketing department bought the radar and trained it to only recognize Samsung products.) The Pixel, which is a great phone, didn't exactly take the world by storm either. Google hasn't reported exact sales, but one estimate showed a million Pixels in the market; another said between three and five million. That's due in part to Google's total inability to keep the phone in stock—another downside of not managing your own hardware—but doesn't inspire much confidence. Either way, Greengart says, ""it certainly hasn’t been a dominant player in the high-end of the market. It doesn’t play at all in one of the biggest markets, China. I can’t see Huawei or Xiaomi or Oppo being worried."" Apple and Samsung haven't lost sleep either. But Google has to try. As we've learned time and again, the best products come from companies that make both hardware and software, each working to optimize and improve the other. Samsung knows it; Apple knows it. As we enter the next phase of tech, where smartphones give way to smart watches and smart speakers and smart lightbulbs and smart cars, there's no room for too-big parts or inefficient software. The winners will be the companies who figure out how to do everything right: hardware, software, marketing, everything. Apple nailed it with phones, and became the richest company in the world. There's another chance coming.",0.0
"Leave it to a Canadian ad campaign to deliver the most inspiring message of this U.S. election.          Oh, Canada. You’re making us blush. Our   neighbors to the north have watched from afar a U.

But Canadians are here to offer a sympathetic message to lift Americans’ spirits.

"For a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine’s hottest field.       Bald but beaming,    Eden Oyelola yanked the long rope to ring the “victory bell” at Children’s National Medical Center last September. She was finally done with her treatment for brain cancer  —   surgery followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy that made her terribly ill. At a “bell party” at her home in Upper Marlboro, Md. later that week, she gobbled down ice cream with friends and rode a pony around the back yard. Her parents exhaled in relief. “We thought she was in the clear,” her father said. The relief was  . In January, the little girl who loved gymnastics started having seizures and losing control of her left side. She frequently stumbled. “What’s wrong with my legs?” she asked. A second surgery followed after an MRI showed that the tumor had returned, forcing her doctors at Children’s to ask whether there was anything else that would give Eden a chance to survive.  The team ultimately turned to the hottest field in medicine and a new class of drugs that has had stunning success in some adults, including former president Jimmy Carter, with even    malignancies. Growing ranks of pediatric oncologists are considering immunotherapy and “checkpoint inhibitors” to try to save desperately ill children.  But young patients with cancer present a special challenge. Research can seem more dangerous because of their age, and drugs that work in adults may fail for the same reason. No one can yet say with certainty whether  —   or to what degree  —   these treatments hold equal promise for children. That allows for hope as well as, in Eden’s case, devastating disappointment. “It’s a new horizon that we need to explore and see if it can help these kids,” said Brian Rood, Eden’s  . “But we’re still learning how to use it. ”   [Immunotherapy shows promise in a growing list of cancers]   Immunotherapy, which one specialist calls “the fourth pillar of cancer treatment” after surgery, radiation and chemo, marshals the body’s immune system to fight a malignancy. As part of that approach, checkpoint inhibitors disrupt a cloaking device tumors wield to evade and suppress T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system. Once T cells can see the cancer, they attack it just as they would other foreign intruders such as bacteria.    Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for adults, but they are only now undergoing broader testing in children. The lag reflects the many significant hurdles of conducting clinical trials with this age group. Eden’s doctors set their hopes on a     clinical trial led by Children’s, a study testing a checkpoint inhibitor treatment in children who have aggressive brain tumors. The complex strategy has its own set of risks; the treatment often causes inflammation and swelling, a dangerous combination in the contained space of the brain. In describing the trial to Eden’s parents, Rood was cautious. Their daughter would need yet another surgery to reduce the size of her tumor, and there was no guarantee she would be eligible for the trial after that, or that the treatment would work. “About the best we can say,” Rood acknowledged, “is that we don’t know that it doesn’t work. ” “Eden will be a guinea pig,” thought Eden’s mother, Sara Amare. But like her husband, Toks Oyelola, she was eager to press ahead. Both knew that the study medication, Keytruda, also called pembrolizumab, was the same one that Carter received after advanced melanoma spread to his liver and brain. Last December, following surgery, radiation and the immunotherapy, the former president announced that his cancer had disappeared. “He was 91,” Amare said. “I thought, ‘Surely, this will work in a   .’ ”    As a child with cancer, Eden belongs to a relatively small group. An estimated 16, 000 children up to age 19 will be diagnosed with the disease in the United States this year, and it will kill fewer than 2, 000. By contrast, about 1. 6 million adults are expected to get a diagnosis, and more than 590, 000 will die of the disease. Pediatric oncologists complain that medicines for children are too few and too toxic, largely because drug companies focus their efforts on the adult market. Only one immunotherapy drug has been specifically approved for pediatric cancer. “Over the last 30 years, we have had very, very few new drugs in our clinics, and we still rely on radiation and chemo,” said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s. “When a drug is developed for prostate cancer or breast cancer or colon cancer, they will say, ‘Here, try this for kids with brain tumors.’ It really doesn’t help these underserved kids. ”       Eden likes drawing, ponies, and the toy babies and pets called Twozies. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Researchers have long known that children are not simply miniature adults; they are biologically different. They tend to get different cancers than adults  —   leukemia rather than lung cancer, for example  —   and even the same cancer can play out differently in their bodies. So, perhaps, may immunotherapy. Many adult tumors have mutations caused by cigarette smoke, sunlight and other environmental insults. Once unmasked by a checkpoint inhibitor, such mutations can be seen by the immune system as “foreign” and deserving of attack. Children’s cancers, however, generally have far fewer mutations and thus may offer fewer targets, according to one theory.   [Checkpoint inhibitor helps melanoma patients survive longer ]   Another kind of immunotherapy, called   cell therapy, is being widely tested in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common and once universally fatal childhood cancer. It has shown extraordinary effectiveness in treating recurrent disease.  By contrast, checkpoint inhibitors in children “may not be the home run they are in adults,” said Crystal Mackall, head of the cancer immunology and immunotherapy program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. “But it’s too early to know. ”  The Oyelola family lives in a comfortable house in a gated community in Prince George’s County, with a back yard big enough to accommodate pony rides on special occasions. Eden, who is obsessed with unicorns, has a    sister, Sade, and an    brother, Tobi. “He chases me, then I chase him,” Eden said on a recent afternoon as the children raced around. Dressed in a shirt decorated with lions, tigers and zebras, she showed little sign of being sick, other than a little puffiness in her face and slightly shorter hair where she had surgery.     Eden and her sister, Sade, 7, look at a picture book of animals and insects as they play in their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eden’s father is a consultant for Ernst & Young whose parents came from Nigeria decades ago. Her mother is a native of Ethi o pia who moved to the United States as a little girl. A wall of photographs in the family room shows a handsome and happy family. On Halloween 2014, Oyelola remembers, “a new normal” took hold. Amare was driving their daughters home from a school parade  —   Eden had been dressed up as the country of Russia. Suddenly, Sade cried from the back seat: “Mommy, Eden is shaking!” Saliva foamed on her lips. Doctors at Children’s diagnosed a febrile seizure, a   event in childhood. But several weeks later, another seizure followed. This time, Children’s did a scan. “We see a mass,” the doctors told Amare. Brain surgery was scheduled for Christmas Eve. Eden’s family decorated her   room with lights, wreaths and a tree. When she woke up on Christmas, she was amazed by the presents, sneaked in by nurses, and by a visit from Santa Claus himself. Those would be the only bright spots of the holiday. The ultimate diagnosis was that Eden had a “primitive, very rare, very unusual tumor,” Rood said, with many of the characteristics of glioblastoma. This deadly type of cancer arises from glia cells, which support brain function. Months of radiation and chemo followed, ending with the bell party in September 2015. Late last year, the    Foundation arranged for the family to go on an   scavenger hunt that culminated in a ride on a “unicorn” at Verizon Center. “Yes, it’s a real unicorn!” Eden declared, caressing the big white horse.  The tumor’s return in January was a crushing blow. Eden quickly had surgery and eventually entered a clinical study involving pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative that is thought to interfere with tumor growth. She began getting violent headaches. “She could wake up in the morning and be hysterical for two hours,” her father said. And she was having three to four seizures an hour.    Eden’s father, Toks Oyelola, wears a variety of inspirational wristbands. As her tumor grew, he pushed her doctors hard for treatment alternatives. (Michael S.   Washington Post)   The doctors took her off the medicine and talked to her parents about the immunotherapy trial and another operation. “It was ” Rood said. Yet they had no other options. In late May, Eden had her third surgery, which succeeded in sharply reducing the tumor and the swelling, and in easing her pain. A few days later, she celebrated her sixth birthday.  Not long after, she got a spot in the Children’s trial.  Brain and    tumors are the    type of childhood cancers, after leukemia. A patient’s prognosis depends on the type of malignancy, whether cancer cells remain after surgery and whether the tumor recurs.  Given the success seen with checkpoint inhibitors for some adult cancers, there is intense interest in trying them in brain tumors in patients of all ages. The hope is that the immune system will be effective at attacking the tumor and breaching the   barrier, a kind of security system that protects the brain yet also prevents many treatments from getting through. Several pediatric trials are underway or in development, including one trying a combination of checkpoint inhibitors that New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has set for next year.   [How cancer gets around the new immunotherapy drugs]   The    trial at Children’s and other institutions is   by the National Cancer Institute and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, a network of children’s hospitals and academic medical centers that conducts   studies of novel treatments. Up to 70 patients will be enrolled, ages 1 to 21, with participants given infusions of Keytruda for 30 minutes every three weeks. The treatments are slated to extend over two years.    Sara Amare has relied on her faith during the nearly two years since her daughter Eden was diagnosed with cancer. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eugene Hwang, a pediatric   at Children’s, and the other investigators are proceeding carefully because of the risks, frequently “pausing” the study to examine results and decide whether changes are needed. One of the toughest challenges in using checkpoint inhibitors or any immunotherapy for brain tumors, Hwang said, is figuring out how to produce the right level of immune response. Too weak and it won’t affect the tumor. But too strong and the swarm of T cells could trigger lethal swelling.  “I have desperation in my back yard, where kids are dying, and there’s hope the next yard over, where adults who have failed trial after trial are surviving,” said Hwang, the study chairman. “There is nothing that is going to dissuade me from trying something that has really revolutionized care for many adults. ”  Eden got her first dose of Keytruda on June 22, and everything seemed fine for the first two weeks. But shortly before her planned second dose, she again began having headaches, and numbness in her left arm. An MRI showed that the mass in her head had doubled in size in barely a month. That raised a critical issue for her physicians: Did the larger mass mean the drug had triggered the robust immune response they wanted? Or was the treatment failing and the cancer’s growth accelerating? Or some combination of both? It was impossible to tell from the scan. Yet the answer would determine whether Eden could continue in the trial. The doctors delayed the second dose and gave her steroids to reduce the brain swelling. That effectively negated the effects of the immunotherapy, but it was the only way to figure out what was happening as they chose how to proceed. Her family tried to carry on with life. They all took a vacation to the beach, making sure they visited Assateague Island to see the wild ponies. Eden seemed to be doing well, and her parents were increasingly sure she would soon get her second Keytruda dose. But on July 28, she awoke in intense pain and was rushed the 20 miles to Children’s. The tumor had gotten significantly bigger in just a few weeks and was starting to push the brain from the right side of her head toward the left. Blood and fluid also appeared to be leaking into the space between the brain and the skull. Doctors treated Eden with high levels of painkillers and higher levels of steroids. And they sat down with her parents. Rood told them that the tumor’s fast growth was making it impossible for Eden to stay on the trial. Take her home, Rood suggested, and make her as comfortable as possible. “I can’t accept that,” Amare said later, even as she talked about going “the God route. ” At her request, pastors from her Ethio pian Orthodox church have come to pray for her daughter.  Her husband is similarly torn. The doctors, he said, “don’t expect a miracle to happen. But I do. ” Eden still romps through the house and plays with her dogs, Winter and Summer. On a recent afternoon, bored for the moment, she climbed onto her father’s lap and whispered in his ear to take her to Target. She wanted to get more Twozies to add to her already sizable collection of the toy babies and pets. “Okay,” Oyelola said with a smile. “Let’s go. ” ",-0.5
"A thumb on the scale helped April’s jobs numbers. The nation’s job market recorded solid growth last month, which now gives economists, politicians and the Federal Reserve ample opportunity to say and do stupid things  —   again. As I predicted would happen   the job market showed good improvement in April. The Labor Department said there were 211, 000 new jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4. 4 percent. The experts were predicting a   in job creation to about 185, 000, so the actual 211, 000 number had some people giddy. “The labor market is back with a bang!” gushed one Wall Street economist who I won’t name because he doesn’t know what he is talking about. True, the 211, 000 jobs were much better than the 98, 000 new jobs first announced for March, which on Friday was revised down to just 79, 000.  But as I explained on Thursday, the Labor Department has its thumb on the scale in April because it uses something called the   Model to guess the number of jobs being created by newly “born” companies that the government somehow doesn’t know about. Using this murky model, it guessed that 255, 000 of these invisible jobs were created in April. Why the Labor Department thinks there are companies being created that it hasn’t yet officially identified in this day and age of instant communication, immediate tax filings and digital snooping is beyond me. But that’s what happens  —   the Labor Department makes a guess each month. This is the same optimism the Labor Department shows each spring  —   even when, like now, there are indications that the economy is flatlining. And every year it creates the sort of irrational optimism that causes foolish statements and misguided government policy. After yesterday’s announcement by the Labor Department, President Trump said  …     Nothing. At least not on Twitter where he is prone to make unfiltered, foolish statements. Nice restraint, Mr. President! The May number that’ll come out the first week of June will also be affected by this     phenomenon. The Labor Department makes generous assumptions for that month as well, so don’t be surprised if May’s job growth is also strong when it’s announced next month. Then the generous assumptions basically stop for the summer. That’s when the conditions of the job market may start to more accurately reflect the other weak economic data. So you can expect to hear the Republicans crowing about Trump’s job creation for another two months and then start making excuses when things slow down this summer.  The Democrats? They’ll probably continue to show off their childishness by coming up with some ridiculous chant. Maybe they will also start sticking out their tongues. As I’ve mentioned many times that even I’m bored, the Fed wants to raise interest rates and needs to raise them. So the April employment number was exactly what the Fed needed, coming as it did after a long series of horrible economic reports. The Fed has selective memory. Fed governors  —   who have the right to say anything they want, no matter how stupid  —   will spend the next month making the case for at least two more   hikes this year. The Fed will never mention the March number being revised down to 79, 000. But the Fed will probably skip a hike at its June meeting and wait until later in the year. And that could be a mistake. If I turn out to be correct, since the Labor Department’s thumb will be lighter on the scale by summer, the economy might not look strong enough for a rate hike. If you think I’m being harsh on the politicians, economists and members of the Fed you are probably right.  But after 10 years of a   economy and missed predictions of better times you would think these people wouldn’t still be fooled by what the economics profession calls “statistical noise”  —   numbers that bounce all over the place and give false readings of what is really going on. Seriously  —   they’ve had 10 years to figure this stuff out!",1.0
"Can You Spot the Idioms in These Photographs?. A picture is worth a thousand words, as the cliché goes, but not all words create the most precise pictures. A test your professor promises will be a “piece of cake” is great, unless you’re imagining something with buttercream. A mechanic who totes a “bag of tricks” might fix your car, but he can’t exactly perform magic. These expressions are idioms, meant to be interpreted figuratively. Photographer Gabriel Zimmer thinks it’s much more fun to do so literally. In his series Polysemantics, he takes the quirkiest English phrases at their word. “It makes you think about the way we use language,” he says. Not that Zimmer considers himself a wordsmith. Growing up in New York City, he turned to crayons and eventually cameras precisely because he isn’t one (nevermind that his work has appeared in The New Yorker). Art, he says, “fills in the gaps where language fails me.” He started Polysemantics in 2016, leaving no stone unturned in his hunt for peculiar idioms, phrases, and words. Turns out, they’re a dime a dozen, with an estimated 25,000 idioms alone in the English language. Many have origins in actual events or legends: History, for instance, is peppered with military leaders drawing actual “lines in the sand” for their bravest men to cross. But as vivid as they are, Zimmer learned not all idioms make for great photos. He tried “splitting hairs” with an ax and his own tresses, but the effect was more horrifying than humorous. A brain he sculpted from ground beef and stuck in his freezer (“brain freeze”) came out “looking, literally, like shit.” He photographed the best in his Brooklyn studio against jewel-toned seamlesses, illuminating them with two or three speedlights, each capped with a thin sheet of colored plastic for a dramatic gradating effect. The results are fun and pithy, sort of like emojis, and they highlight how people are always talking with images. Words and pictures don’t compete so much as keep each other company—like peas in a pod.",0.0
"Wildlife Detective Uses DNA to Link Stolen Ivory to Big Cartels. On June 5, 2014, Kenyan police entered a Fuji Motors car yard in the port city of Mombasa, where they found a two-ton stash of ivory. The discovery led them to a middle-aged Kenyan named Feisal Mohamed Ali, who two years later was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Conservationists hailed it as a major blow to the international poaching syndicates responsible for killing 40,000 endangered elephants in Africa every year. With only 400,000 animals left on the continent, these crime networks threaten to wipe out every last African elephant within the next two decades. Half a world away in Seattle, Sam Wasser read news of the verdict with growing elation. A conservation biologist at the University of Washington, Wasser had been analyzing the DNA of seized elephant tusks, comparing it with the DNA of other elephants he had studied, and sharing his findings with Kenyan authorities. His work had concluded that multiple ivory hauls had originated from a single cartel believed to be headed by Feisal. Even though Feisal was only tried for one count of possession, the length of the sentence sent a message. “At the time, it was the biggest positive thing that had happened in this whole long fight,” says Wasser.

"In Syria and Iraq, the Islamic State is in retreat on multiple fronts.   BEIRUT  —   As European governments scramble to contain the expanding terrorist threat posed by the Islamic State, on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria the group is a rapidly diminishing force. In the latest setbacks for the militants on Thursday, Syrian government troops entered the outskirts of the historic town of Palmyra after a   offensive aided by Russian and U. S. airstrikes helped Iraqi forces overrun a string of Islamic State villages in northern Iraq that had been threatening a U. S. base nearby. These are just two of the many fronts in both countries where the militants are being squeezed, stretched and pushed back. Nowhere are they on the attack. They have not embarked on a successful offensive in nearly nine months. Their leaders are dying in U. S. strikes at the rate of one every three days, inhibiting their ability to launch attacks, according to U. S. military officials.   commanders no longer speak of a scarily formidable foe but of defenses that crumble within days and fighters who flee at the first sign they are under attack. “They don’t fight. They just send car bombs and then run away. And when we surround them they either surrender or infiltrate themselves among the civilians,” said Lt. Gen.     commander of Iraq’s counterterrorism forces, who is overseeing the latest Iraqi offensive to capture the town of Hit in the province of Anbar.   On March 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would begin pulling its military from Syria, potentially winding down nearly six months of airstrikes. The alliance between Russia and the regime of Bashar   goes back decades. Here’s a bit of historical context that explains why Russia was fighting to prop up its closest ally in the Middle East. (Ishaan Tharoor and Jason   Washington Post)   “Their morale is shaken. We listen to them on their communications devices. Their leaders are begging them to fight, but they answer that it is a lost cause. They refuse to obey orders and run away. ”  [New ISIS recruits have deep criminal roots]  The group still controls big swaths of territory and could potentially prove as deadly in defeat as it was when it was on the offensive. Strikes in Belgium, Turkey and France may herald the tip of an iceberg of militant networks already infiltrated into Europe, law enforcement officials fear. Recent weeks have also seen a revival in Iraq as well as Syria of the suicide bombings and    assaults that do not gain ground but are deadly to people otherwise living beyond the militants’ reach. But U. S. military officials say they believe that after more than 18 months, the military campaign has found its stride. “As time goes on, as our systems mature, we’re becoming more effective,” said Col. Steve Warren, the U. S. military’s spokesman in Baghdad for the campaign. “We’ve become much better at spotting them. Anytime they try to move, we’re able to find and finish them. They can’t move, haven’t won any battles for a long time, and they’ve got difficulty leading because we’re hitting their leaders. ” It is not only the U. S.  effort that is gaining momentum. Russian airstrikes played a major part in facilitating the Syrian army’s entry into historic Palmyra, which was snatched by the Islamic State nearly a year ago during its last major burst of offensive activity. Syrian forces helped by Russian strikes also have made gains around the Islamic State stronghold of Bab, east of Aleppo, and are making some inroads on the southwestern outskirts of Raqqa province. It is unlikely, but not implausible, that the Syrian army will reach Raqqa before U. S.  forces do, U. S. officials say.  [How the battle against the Islamic State is redrawing the map of the Middle East]  Most of the advances, however, are being made by the assortment of loosely allied forces, backed to varying degrees by the United States, that are ranged along the vast perimeter of the Islamic State’s territories. They include the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, in northeastern Syria; the Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq; the Iraqi army, which has revived considerably since its disastrous collapse in 2014; and the Shiite militias, which are not directly aligned with the United States but are fighting on the same side. The U. S. military estimated earlier this year that the Islamic State had lost 40 percent of the territory it had controlled at its peak in 2014, a figure that excludes the most recent advances. In Anbar province, a newly regenerated Iraqi army is advancing along the Euphrates Valley toward the town of Hit and has captured more than 25 miles of territory in the past week. In eastern Syria, the seizure late last month of the town of Shadadi by the Kurdish YPG  —   aided by U. S. Special Forces  —   was accompanied by the capture of nearly 1, 000 square miles of territory. Though the town had not been headlined as an Islamic State stronghold, it has long been known in Syria as an epicenter of extremism and a major source of Syrian jihadist fighters against U. S. troops during the U. S. occupation of Iraq. Most recently, it had served as a key supply and staging area for battlefronts in both Syria and Iraq, and it was there that one of the most powerful and effective of the Islamic State’s leaders, Omar   was killed in a U. S. airstrike earlier this month.  [The Islamic State’s ‘emir of war’ dies of wounds suffered in U. S. airstrike]  The operation was planned to take place over weeks. Instead, the town fell within days, said a senior U. S. administration official who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly. “Shadadi was going to be a major   operation,” he said. “The ISIS guys had dug trenches and everything. Instead, they completely collapsed. They’re collapsing town by town. ” The biggest constraints on further military advances now are largely political, U. S. officials say. Progress on important fronts such as reconciliation in Iraq and diplomatic efforts to end the war in Syria are not keeping pace with the advances on the battlefield, stalling plans to take the fight to the Islamic State’s most vital strongholds. Plans for an operation to capture Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State’s   caliphate, are on hold because of tensions between Kurds and Arabs over who would participate and how to govern the city after it has been taken. The YPG has declared a breakaway federal region that does not include Raqqa, while U. S. plans to train and equip an Arab force to fight for the town are lagging. Likewise, preparations for an offensive for Mosul, the biggest city under Islamic State control, are being held up by disputes over who should take part and how to govern the northern Iraqi city after it falls. The powerful Shiite militias, credited with making many of the earliest gains, are insisting they be given a role, over objections from the U. S. military and the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga. “We could probably liberate Mosul tomorrow, but we would have a real mess on our hands if we did,” said Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “A lot of work needs to be done to ensure an orderly transition of power in Mosul. ” The Iraqi army described Thursday’s operation outside the northern Nineveh province town of Makhmour as the start of the Mosul offensive. U. S. and Kurdish officials, however, said it was a far more limited operation, to drive the Islamic State out of a string of villages that have been threatening U. S. Iraqi and Kurdish peshmerga troops based in the town. A U. S. Marine based in Makhmour died in rocket fire last Saturday. An Iraqi army officer in Makhmour, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said troops encountered little resistance, overrunning five mostly empty villages ahead of retreating militant fighters. The Islamic State continues to defend when it is attacked and shows no sign that it is losing cohesion in its core territories  —   but it is starting to become possible to foresee the group’s ultimate defeat, said Knights, who thinks that could come by the end of next year. “They are starting to fall apart,” he said. “They’re a small movement. If you bring them under pressure on half a dozen battlefields at the same time, they can’t do it. ”   Mustafa Salim in Baghdad contributed to this report.

"How Donald Trump responded to the death of Fidel Castro, ‘a brutal dictator’.   Fidel Castro is dead!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016   Donald Trump has weighed twice on the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The   offered up a   tweet shortly after 8 a. m. Saturday, saying simply: ”Fidel Castro is dead!” Trump followed that up a few hours later with a lengthier statement, in which he called Castro a ”brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades” and said he hoped Castro’s death gave Cuban Americans ”the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.” ”Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,” the statement said. ”While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.” Trump added: ”Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.” Shortly thereafter, Vice   Mike Pence chimed in on Twitter, saying: ”The tyrant #Castro is dead. New hope dawns.”   The tyrant #Castro is dead. New hope dawns. We will stand with the oppressed Cuban people for a free and democratic Cuba. Viva Cuba Libre!  —   Mike Pence (@mike_pence) November 26, 2016   Trump has been sounding off against Castro for decades  —   and battled criticism for reportedly exploring whether to open a casino in Cuba in the 1990s. Trump came under intense scrutiny in September following allegations that he knowingly violated the U. S. embargo on Cuba in the 1990s, news that threatened to sour Cuban Americans’ opinion of him. A Newsweek story said that Trump spent $68, 000 to send business consultants to Cuba despite the embargo. Trump Hotels reimbursed Seven Arrows Investment & Development Corp. an American consulting firm, shortly after Trump launched his bid for the White House, according to the article.         Trump vehemently denied those allegations on the campaign trail and, in 1999, wrote a lengthy opinion editorial for the Miami Herald saying why he would never do business in Castro’s Cuba.  In the   Trump wrote that ”it would be instructive to remember the role that Castro played in the struggle between  —   yes  —   good and evil.” ”He turned his island over to his Soviet patrons,” Trump continued. ”He was quite willing to have nuclear missiles, launched from Cuban soil, destroy American cities. He exported revolution to Central and South America. He abetted Libyan terrorism. He gave asylum to murderers. He posted troops in Africa. ”More important, he turned his nation into a   prison. His regime controls every aspect of human life   access to food, medical assistance, schools and employment. Castro has not mellowed with age. Terror continues to reign. The secret police are unrestrained. The disappearance and beatings of citizens are still tools of civilian control, as is the suppression of free speech. Castro’s ruthless domination of the Cuban people has not lessened even as his regime crumbles.” In his book, ”The America We Deserve,” Trump said Castro should be arrested and tried. “The first time Castro leaves Cuba for any nation we have extradition treaties with, he should be detained, arrested and extradited to the U. S. for indictment and trial on charges of murder and terrorism,” according to an excerpt in Townhall. com. As Trump ran for President, he said he was in favor of President Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, although he blasted Obama for a “  deal for Cuba,” according to The Washington Post’s Jose A. DelReal. Trump had vowed to reverse Obama’s efforts to open U. S. relations with Cuba if he was elected president, “unless the Castro regime meets our demands  —   not my demands, our demands. ”              Caption   Former Cuban political leader and communist revolutionary, Fidel Castro, dies at 90.  1958 Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro is shown in the study of the apartment in New York he occupied, when he inaugurated the 26th of July Movement and collected vast sums of money for the first “invasion” of Cuba on Dec. 2, 1956.

"How regulators can discourage a repeat of United’s overbooking fiasco.  United Airlines is getting a lot of negative press after videos showed security guards forcibly removing a paying customer from a flight scheduled to fly from Chicago to Louisville.      @United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here’s how they did it: pic. twitter.  —   Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017    The flight was overbooked, and United needed to find seats for four of its crew members so they could staff later flights taking off from Louisville. The airline offered passengers up to $800 to leave, but when no one volunteered, United selected four passengers at random and ordered them off the flight. The video shows one of the four, who said he was a doctor and needed to see patients the next morning. He refused to leave the flight, so security guards dragged him down the aisle. It was a shocking scene that highlights one of the more controversial aspects of American air travel.    Airlines routinely overbook their flights, and in theory that should be good for everyone. Seats on airline flights are a scarce commodity, and most flights have a few  . So if airlines never overbooked, there would be a few empty seats on almost every flight.    Instead, airlines typically sell a few more tickets than they have seats. Sometimes, there are enough   that everyone gets a seat. Otherwise, the airline offers passengers financial incentives to voluntarily give up their seat. Most of the time, there are at least a few people on any given flight that are willing to delay their flight for a few hours or a day in exchange for compensation. The problem, of course, comes if there are no   and no one willing to be bumped to a later flight. That’s what happened over the weekend, and it led to an ugly scene.    Some people have looked at this situation and blamed United for overbooking flights. But I think that’s the wrong response. If airlines stopped overbooking flights, there would be empty seats on most flights and ticket prices would be correspondingly higher. Rather, the problem was that United was too stingy in offering passengers compensation to voluntarily leave the airplane. Federal regulations give airlines a relatively easy out in situations like this: They can bump a passenger involuntarily if they pay four times the ticket price (up to $1, 350). According to news reports, United only went up to $800 per passenger  —   which wasn’t enough to convince anyone else on the flight to reorganize their plans. United could have kept raising its offer, and eventually it would have found someone willing to take a later flight.    Instead, United invoked the rules allowing them to bump passengers involuntarily. That might have saved the airline some money in the short term, but it also earned them a lot of bad publicity. United could and probably should have offered more, even if they wound up paying more than the federally mandated payment for involuntarily bumping, to avoid creating a PR nightmare. For their part, federal regulators could discourage airlines from behaving like this in the future by boosting the compensation required to customers who get bumped involuntarily. That would have given United a stronger incentive to find a volunteer rather than dragging passengers off the plane kicking and screaming. Update: United responds.

"This Year SpaceX Made Us All Believe in Reusable Rockets. At the beginning of 2018, Elon Musk predicted that SpaceX would pull off 30 launches.

"Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck ahead of first debate. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied in a   race for the White House as they head to a   debate at Hofstra University on Monday night  —   a highly anticipated showdown that may determine their political fates, according to a new poll. The GOP and Democratic nominees each get 46 percent of likely voters in a    race, while Trump gets 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent in a   race that includes Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein,  . A Quinnipiac national poll released Monday also found Clinton and Trump as close as could be  —   she’s leading 47 to 46 percent  —   in a    race. In a   contest, Clinton’s ahead 44 percent to 43 percent among likely voters, with 8 percent supporting Johnson and 2 percent backing Stein. The poll  —   which has a margin of error of 2. 9 percentage points  —   shows little change since Quinnipiac’s September survey, when Clinton led 41 percent to 39 percent in a   race. Races in key states were equally tight.  In Colorado, likely voters break 42 percent for Trump, 41 percent for Clinton, 13 percent for Johnson and 3 percent for Stein,  . And in Pennsylvania, likely voters split 45 percent for Clinton, 44 percent for Trump, 6 percent for Johnson and 3 percent for Stein. Those numbers are well within the   poll’s 3.  margin of error. Clinton fares better in   matchups in both battleground states, topping Trump 50 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in Pennsylvania, and 49 percent to 47 percent in Colorado. Clinton faces higher expectations when she and The Donald face a TV audience that is expected to get into 100   Super Bowl territory. About half, 49 percent, say they anticipate the former secretary of state will perform better, while 39 percent say that for the mogul, according to the Bloomberg poll. Ann Selzer, the   pollster who oversaw the poll, said there are indications that Clinton’s margins with women and young voters have eroded in the past three months, Bloomberg News reported. In August, she had a   advantage over Trump in the   race and a   advantage when the   candidates were included. In June, when Johnson was also included, she had a   edge on Trump. Clinton had a   lead among female likely voters in June, when both Trump and Johnson were included. She has a   advantage  —   52 percent to his 39 percent  —   when measured only against Trump, similar to her   lead in August. Among likely voters under age 35, Clinton gets 50 percent to Trump’s 40 percent, down from her   margin in August in the   race and from her   margin in June in the   race. The Bloomberg poll’s margin of error is plus or minus 3. 1 percentage points for   numbers. More than seven in 10 likely voters rate Clinton’s truthfulness as “just fair” or “poor,” while more than six in 10 say that of Trump. “It will be hard for either candidate to criticize the other too harshly on this form of integrity,” Selzer said. “They are the pot and the kettle. ” About   of likely voters, 69 percent, say Trump should release his tax returns. Trump is rated better on physical health than Clinton, with 61 percent calling his “excellent” or “good” compared to 36 percent who give Clinton good marks. Only 8 percent call Trump’s health “poor” compared to 31 percent for Clinton, the Bloomberg Politics Poll found. But half of likely voters say they aren’t bothered at all that Clinton didn’t immediately tell the public about her recent bout with pneumonia, a diagnosis she did not disclose until after she was seen collapsing during a   ceremony. After Trump recently acknowledged President Obama’s US birth,   of likely voters say Obama was born in the US, while 11 percent say he wasn’t and 14 percent aren’t sure. Among Trump’s supporters, 22 percent say they don’t believe Obama was born in the US  —   and therefore is ineligible for the presidency  —   and another 22 percent say they’re unsure. Trump’s supporters are a little more excited about their candidate, with 65 percent saying they’re fairly or very enthusiastic. Among Clinton backers, 61 percent say that. ‘It will be hard for either candidate to criticize the other too harshly on this form of integrity. They are the pot and the kettle.’ Among five potential voter concerns about Clinton  —   including her delayed pneumonia disclosure  —   the one that tests highest as bugging voters a lot, at 57 percent, is her use of private email as secretary of state, the Bloomberg poll found. For Trump, the   issues relate to his charitable foundation and to his controversial real estate program, the defunct Trump University. Each prompts 46 percent of likely voters to say they’re bothered a lot. The   poll reflects tight national polls and    results in several other key battleground states including Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio. In Pennsylvania and Colorado, Clinton holds significant advantages for handling foreign policy. She also tops Trump by eight points on handling immigration among voters in Colorado, a state where a Pew Research Center analysis has estimated that about a quarter of the state’s large Latino population is foreign born. In Pennsylvania, Clinton and Trump run about even on that issue. Clinton also is seen as having made an effective case that Trump does not have the temperament to be president. She is viewed as better suited for the White House by a nearly    margin in each state. Clinton holds smaller advantages as the better candidate to be   . But she continues to be behind Trump when voters are asked which of the two is more honest and trustworthy.",1.0

"Here are 6 plausible ways this election could go wildly off the rails.  Everyone expected Tuesday’s presidential election would be boring. Millions would cast votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. One candidate would win, the other would lose, and that would be that.     But given the closeness in the race right now, there’s at least a chance the final results could be much, much messier. Like: an Electoral College tie that has to get resolved by Congress. A disputed state. A pivotal elector going rogue. Chaos on the level of Bush versus Gore in 2000 or Tilden versus Hayes in 1876.* Thanks to our byzantine Electoral College system, all sorts of convoluted outcomes can happen, at least in principle. So here’s a guide to six wildest ways this election could end. None of these are guaranteed, mind you, but they’re all unnervingly plausible. 1) Clinton seemingly wins the Electoral College  —   but two electors in Washington throw the election to Trump             Keep in mind a key fact about US presidential elections: Voters don’t directly decide who becomes president. Instead, voters in each state vote for specific slates of “electors” who, in turn, convene in December to select the next president.    The vast majority of the time, these electors vote for the candidates they’ve previously pledged to support. So if a majority of voters in New York elect the Democratic slate of electors, those electors will almost certainly cast their 29 electoral votes for Clinton. In about half the states, electors are bound by law to keep these pledges.     But electors don’t absolutely have to follow through. If an elector wants to go rogue and vote for a different presidential candidate, there’s really nothing stopping him or her. And in a close race, like the scenario shown on the map above, a couple of “faithless” electors could conceivably swing the entire election. So consider: Right now, in Washington state, two electors on the Democratic slate have suggested that they won’t vote for Clinton. Here’s Robert Satiacum, a Democratic elector and a former Bernie Sanders supporter: “No, no, no on Hillary. Absolutely not. No way. ” A second elector, Bret Chiafalo, has also refused to say he’d back her. Under state law, they’d face criminal charges and a $1, 000 fine for defying the state’s election results, but they could do it.    If Clinton only won states worth 270 electoral votes, those two rogue electors could potentially tip the race to Trump. If they voted for Sanders, the final tally would be   and the race would get thrown to the   House (see below). True, in that situation, as Jeff Stein explained here, these Democratic electors would face enormous pressure from the rest of the party to cast a vote for Clinton. And it seems awfully unlikely that two progressive electors would hand the White House to Trump out of spite. But thanks to the Electoral College, this is all totally possible. 2) The Electoral College ends in a tie  —   and the House gives the election to Trump             Under the Electoral College, a candidate needs 270 out of 538 available electoral votes to become president. But the situation gets more complicated if neither candidate gets to 270. Which can definitely happen  —   just see the   electoral map above, where Trump wins Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Florida.  So what happens in the event of a tie? Well, assuming that the electors all voted as expected and certify the   vote, the presidential election would get thrown to   …     the House of Representatives.    On January 6, 2017, the newly elected House members would gather in Washington, DC, to select the next president. Each of the 50 state delegations would get one vote, and the delegations would have to choose among the top three electoral  . Whichever candidate gets the support of 26 state delegations becomes president.  There’s a good chance that at least 27 state delegations will be majority Republican come January (especially if the presidential race is so close). So the most likely scenario here is that they’d cast a vote for Donald Trump and he would become president of the United States. It’d be contentious as hell, but it would be perfectly constitutional: it worked for Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams, after all. 3) No candidate wins the Electoral College  —   and the House gives the presidency to   …     Evan McMullin?             The House wouldn’t have to give the election to Trump, however. The only rule, under the 12th Amendment, is that the state delegations have to vote for one of the top three finalists in the Electoral College. Enter Evan McMullin. The    former CIA officer is independently running for president, backed by a few establishment #NeverTrump types like Bill Kristol. And he’s doing remarkably well in Mormon Utah, well enough that he could conceivably win the state and be a top three finalist in the Electoral College. In that case, 26 Republican state delegations could in theory decide that they’d prefer an establishment guy over Trump and make McMullin president  —   even though he’d only won one state. It seems hard to fathom the House GOP would ever do this, since it’d make millions of Trump voters in their districts absolutely livid. But rules are rules, and this one can’t be ruled out. 4) The House makes Trump president  —   and the Senate makes Tim Kaine vice president             There’s one other important detail about a tie in the Electoral College. The House gets to choose the president. But the Senate gets to choose the vice president  —   with each senator getting one vote and being required to pick among the top two vice presidential   in the Electoral College.    It’s entirely plausible that come January 6, 2017, Democrats will have a thin majority in the Senate. So, yes, they could select Tim Kaine to serve alongside newly installed President Donald Trump. I’ll just leave that possibility here. 5) The election hinges on a tied state  —   and gets resolved by two balls in a jug             In the election scenario seen above, the race all comes down to New Hampshire. Whoever wins New Hampshire gets 270 electoral votes and goes on to the White House.  So let’s imagine New Hampshire is   …     tied. Literally tied. As in: 360, 212 people voted for Trump; 360, 212 people voted for Clinton.  What happens in that case? Most states have their own laws for what to do in the event of a tie. Some, like North Carolina, just redo the election. But others, like New Hampshire, decide the winner by “lot. ” As in, a coin toss or drawing straws. In the past, New Hampshire’s secretary of state has broken tie votes at the local level by gathering the two candidates, placing two numbered balls in a jug, shaking the jug, and then asking one of the candidates to call out a number, before picking out a ball.  The statistical odds of a tiebreaker in New Hampshire determining the election are spectacularly low. But sure: President Trump, brought to you by two balls in a jug. That’s a thing that could happen. 6) The Supreme Court has to resolve the election  —   but is deadlocked               If you consult your repressed memories, you may recall that the 2000 presidential election all came down to disputed vote counts in Florida. There were hanging chads. Al Gore wanted manual recounts. And, after weeks of disorder, the Supreme Court eventually resolved these questions in favor of George W. Bush, by a   vote that still triggers deep loathing to this day. It was bitter, it was divisive, it was not something anyone really wants to repeat again.    Here’s the bad news: if a similar dispute in Florida happened today, it would be so, so much worse. Because right now, the Supreme Court only has eight members  —   four liberals and four conservatives  —   thanks to Senate Republicans’ refusal to confirm Merrick Garland. Which means that we could easily see the current Supreme Court reach a   deadlock over some crucial recount questions. If that happened, any electoral disputes would ultimately get resolved by lower circuit courts or state supreme courts, depending on where the disputed elections occurred. As Darren Samuelsohn and Josh Gerstein explain for Politico, each of these courts has its own particular partisan bent, and litigants on both sides would try to steer any case toward a venue more favorable to their party.  It’d be the election that never ended. The legal wrangling and ensuing political circus would drag on for weeks. Eventually, some court somewhere would make a final decision. But it’d get incredibly ugly.  *Important Rutherford B. Hayes footnote I mentioned above that we could see chaos along the lines of the Samuel Tilden versus Rutherford B. Hayes election of 1876. On second thought, scratch that. That 1876 election was just far crazier (and far more appalling) than anything conceivable today.  In 1876, you had Southern states still under armed occupation   War. You had violent attacks by whites against   black voters. Three states  —   Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana  —   couldn’t even agree on which candidate had won. A   electoral commission split between the two parties in which the 15th appointee, a Supreme Court justice with a reputation for independence, just happened to get offered a Senate seat by Republicans in his home state, thereby giving the final   seat to the GOP. In the end, the Republican Hayes won the White House, but only after agreeing to withdraw the remaining federal troops from the South and put an end to Reconstruction  —   which was followed by decades of black disenfranchisement throughout the South.  Nothing this year really comes close.  Watch: The bad map we see every election     ",-1.0
"How Trump can keep Iran in check. There’s promise and danger in President Trump’s tough new tone on Iran. On Wednesday, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn popped up during the daily White House briefing and delivered a somewhat cryptic message: “As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice. ” Afterward, when three administration officials briefed reporters on Flynn’s warning, they declined to specify what the warning meant. On Thursday, the White House announced new sanctions on eight   and 17    Iranian entities,  . Flynn’s warning came before new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was sworn in. He’s still without a deputy. New Defense Department officials are struggling to locate the bathrooms at the Pentagon. I’m told the Middle East desk at Flynn’s own White House shop is just starting to fully staff up. The danger, therefore, is that an   administration is making idle warnings. President Obama illustrated the folly of such actions with his infamous “red line” that never materialized, thereby escalating the deadly Syrian war. But unlike Obama, Trump isn’t wedded to the nuclear deal, and so will be less willing to look the other way on Iranian violations. Since the deal was struck in 2015, Iran has made a habit of pushing the envelope of its terms. Tehran armed, trained and financed unsavory allies like Syria’s President Bashar   Lebanon’s Hezbollah and the Houthis of Yemen. And it launched at least 12 ballistic missiles, despite a UN Security Council resolution that “called upon” the mullahs to refrain from testing   missiles. Iran never actually signed the deal, and Obama didn’t bother getting Senate   by making it a treaty. So Security Council Resolution 2331, passed unanimously shortly after the deal was completed, is its only legally binding document. Yet the mullahs scoff at the resolution, including, notably, its polite request to halt missile testing. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said this week Tehran is fully within its rights to test “defensive” missiles. Other officials have grudgingly said they must follow the deal but don’t give much weight to the UN resolution. Oh, and the missile Iran tested Sunday was far from merely defensive. It’s modeled after a Russian KH55, designed to carry a small nuclear payload. The Iran deal, supposedly meant to prevent arming Iran with atomic bombs, overlooked delivery methods, addressing them in the UN resolution instead. So missile launches have been up till now handled by the Security Council’s sanctions committee, where Russia made sure nothing with any teeth got through. The mullahs got away with too much for too long. Putting Iran “on notice” is done by Trump’s favorite mode of operation: unpredictability. “Nothing is off the table,” Trump said Thursday when asked about a military option on Iran. Unpredictability may be dangerous but also has its advantages: Since November, Iranian militants mostly stopped harassing US ships in the Persian Gulf  —   where Revolutionary Guard boats occasionally buzzed US Navy assets, narrowly avoiding sparking a wider military confrontation. Beefing up the American military presence in the Gulf, including a display of US arms that can hit nuclear facilities and missile factories, would further boost Flynn’s “notice. ” So would new sanctions. Obama scoffed at them, warning such measures could undo the nuke deal. Now, “after years of unilateral concessions and flexibility by the previous administration, it’s time for the United States to push back,” Sen. Marco Rubio said this week. Along with two other colleagues, he introduced a new legislation mostly targeting Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps  —   sanctioning them and tracking their affiliated companies, which go to lengths to disguise their affiliation with the Guard. Will such measures collapse the Iran deal, and then lead to war, as some warn? “If Trump is resolute and serious, the Iranians will fold,” predicts the Israeli   broadcaster Menashe Amir. Once the mullahs realize American sanctions and military threats endanger the regime’s survival, which is their top concern, they’ll keep their end of Obama’s bargain, he says. So yes, Trump is yet to show he’s capable of designing an effective, not to mention nuanced, policy. But his chaotic style is reaping some benefits, and may yet produce even more. If smartly followed through, who knows  —   it may even make Obama’s Iran deal great again.",1.0
"This federal agency’s homepage just went dark. Really dark. Literally as black as coal.. It is a tale of two photographs, one light and airy, the other kind of, well, dark. On Wednesday, the feature photograph on the Bureau of Land Management’s homepage was an idyllic shot of what appears to be a sunrise over pretty green bluff, witnessed by a pair of backpackers.      But seemingly overnight, there was a noticeable change. Gone were the boy and man from the wild land that the BLM controls, and in its place was coal. A great wall of carbon literally blacked out the old sunny view.    Screen grab. (Bureau of Land Management, Department of Interior)  The photo speaks volumes about the way the Trump administration is prioritizing the land. The BLM, under the Interior Department, controls more than half a billion acres, including national monuments and wilderness areas that humans visit and where a variety of animals roam, but the feature image is all about coal. It follows President Trump’s campaign promise to bring back the coal industry and his recent executive order lifting a moratorium on new coal leases. It also follows the issuance of a lease to mine 56 million tons of coal in Utah. “The United States has more coal than any other nation on Earth,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, “and we are lucky to be at a time in our history that we have the technology available to responsibly mine coal and return our land to equal or better quality after. ” The United States also has an abundance of natural gas, which is surging in use as power plants that once generated electricity by burning coal switch to gas. The Energy Department spells out coal’s troubles clearly in a report released in January. “The amount of coal in the national energy generation mix (both Fuels and Electricity Generation) has declined by 53 percent since 2006. ” Meanwhile, electricity generation from natural gas has increased 33 percent.    The   Valley Generating Station in California’s San Fernando Valley on March 10. (David   Images)  At the signing ceremony for his executive order, Trump showed that he is a champion for the development of fossil fuels, even when one product is bashing the other. “We will unlock   natural gas, oil and shale energy. We will produce American coal to power American industry,” he said.     It was a puzzling ad lib, considering how nonpartisan industry analysts view the future of coal. “Too many companies are still mining too much coal for too few customers,” which is a fundamental problem for the industry, said the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As for Trump’s claim that mining more coal will employ more workers, the IEEFA isn’t so sure. Job losses will continue, “related in part to the coal industry’s   business model of producing more coal with fewer workers,” it said.  ",-0.5
"Democrats had a bold response to Trump’s speech. It was the Spanish version..  If you’re a young progressive, a racial justice activist, or someone who’s developed an affinity for the verb “resist” in the past several months, you probably watched the wrong Democratic response to President Trump’s joint session of Congress.    Unless you speak Spanish, that is. The   response, delivered by former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear in a diner that looked like a sitcom set, wasn’t for you. Instead, you should have listened to the   response, delivered by DREAMer and activist Astrid Silva (sporting sleek purple hair) on Telemundo and Univision. Beshear’s speech was for people who would like to see President Trump live up to some of the promises he made on the campaign trail. Silva’s speech was for those who are terrified that he might. Of course, many more people saw Beshear than Silva  —   including the people who would have been much more receptive to the latter. And that’s a problem for Democrats.    Right now, Democrats are trying to harness a wave of   energy and activism. The Democratic establishment is trying to convince activists that the Democratic Party is their ally and champion, not an    version of the Republican Party that needs to be challenged from within (à la Bernie Sanders) or without (à la Jill Stein).     But at the same time, Democrats are trying to extend an open hand to independents and Trump voters who might help them win back the Upper Midwest and Rust Belt states they lost in 2016. It’s not an impossible balancing act, but it’s going to be very hard  —   as last night’s dueling response speeches demonstrated.    The two Democratic responses were speaking totally different languages  —   figuratively as well as literally Doing a   response to the State of the Union, in addition to the minority party’s traditional English response, became standard during the Obama administration. In that case, of course, the party responding was the GOP.  Appealing to Latinos (during a time when they were fleeing the Republican Party in droves) wasn’t the easiest task for the Republican politicians assigned to give the   response. While there were variations, the two speeches typically used the same base text  —   although Republicans’   State of the Union responses often included issues that were absent from the standard response, such as immigration reform and Cuba.  The approach of offering the same basic ideas in different languages wouldn’t have been possible if the Republican Party were using its State of the Union responses solely to fire up the base. But the Republican responses to Obama’s State of the Union speeches were typically efforts to bridge the establishment and base of the party  —   selecting young politicians with Tea Party cred but upward aspirations, like Marco Rubio or Nikki Haley. So while there were things in the   speeches that might have surprised some Republican voters, there was little in the   responses that would have offended Latinos.    The Democrats, in their first response of the Trump era  —   Tuesday’s speech wasn’t technically a State of the Union, but it was treated as one  —   took a different approach. They wrote entirely separate speeches in English and Spanish. (If you don’t speak Spanish, you can read the official English translation of the speech here.)  Essentially, the Democratic Party was narrowcasting  —   using different language to demonstrate belonging in two different communities. Beshear’s speech was for moderate white   and   voters in the Rust Belt, Appalachia, and the Upper Midwest  —   the voters who voted for Obama in 2008, and maybe even 2012, but voted for Trump in 2016. Beshear was selected in part because he was a governor who made an Affordable Care Act exchange work in a red state  —   a perfect messenger for voters who are suddenly worried that the politicians they elected to “fix” the ACA might end up making the health care system worse. Silva’s speech, on the other hand, was by definition going to reach an audience whose biggest concern about Trump is that he will discriminate against them  —   immigrants, Latinos, people for whom English isn’t a first language:  In this country there is no space for discrimination, racial profiling, or persecution. But sadly, this is what the Trump Administration has brought forth for Latinos and immigrants. During his first weeks as President, Trump signed executive orders that endanger our entire community. He took actions that focus specifically on hurting immigrants and refugees. He is spending resources on targeting working immigrant families for deportation, he wants to spend billions of dollars to build an unnecessary border wall, and he’s looking for ways to deny entry to our Muslim brothers and sisters.  It was inevitable that Trump’s immigration policies would be the center point of Silva’s speech. But Democratic speechwriters made her condemnation of Trump broader  —   making it a cri de coeur for all people who feel more vulnerable in the US because of the man in the White House, and all people who’ve been “in the streets” since Trump’s win:     [It’s needed for] those of us who understand what’s at risk for women, for the LGBTQ community, for our environment, for workers, immigrants, young people, and refugees, [to] work together to protect our communities from deportation, violence, and discrimination. That’s the only way to safeguard the values that make our country great. Immigrants and refugees are the heart and soul, and the promise of this country. And we are not alone. Democrats have vowed to fight for us and for the middle class. They are our frontline against President Trump and Republicans’ harmful policies  —   in Congress, in the Senate, in the courts, and in the streets.  The speech wasn’t recorded in English. But it’s entirely likely that if it had been, it might have resonated with younger, more progressive Democrats  —   the ones who’ve been attending Women’s Marches or airport protests  —   far more than Beshear’s speech did. The Democratic split: hold Trump to his promises, or raise the alarm about them? The problem with tailoring your message like this is that it can too easily shade into double talk: promising two groups of people contradictory things, or saying something to one group that would alienate the other if they heard and understood it. The Democratic responses didn’t particularly diverge when it came to policy (although one assumes a Latino audience would have bristled at Beshear going out of his way to assure viewers that Democrats believe “we need to enforce our immigration laws”). But rhetorically, the attitudes toward Trump couldn’t have been more different.  Beshear’s speech asked President Trump to live up to the populist image he projected on the campaign trail: “Mr. President, as a candidate, you promised to be a champion for people struggling to make ends meet, and I hope you live up to that promise. ” When talking about health care, Beshear returned to the theme: “Folks here in Kentucky expect you to keep your word. Because this isn’t a game. It’s life or death for people. ” That message might resonate with an audience that voted for Trump, or at least found things in his candidacy to like, who have been disappointed with him mostly for (say) appointing so many Goldman Sachs executives to high administration positions. It wouldn’t resonate with an audience that was scared of Trump from the beginning  —   for whom “campaign promises” don’t mean his promise to replace Obamacare with something “terrific” but rather his early pledge to deport all 11 million unauthorized immigrants and ban all Muslims from entering the country.    Those are the people whom Silva’s speech addressed. She reminded viewers that Trump’s promises are threats:  He made it very clear during his presidential campaign that he wanted his supporters to believe that all immigrants are criminals and refugees are terrorists. . .. President Trump is taking us back to some of the darkest times in our history: criminalizing anyone who is different, pitting us against each other, and sending the wrong message to the rest of the world, helping to breed anger and hate from terrorist groups to our country.  Both Beshear and Silva criticized Trump’s attacks on the media for (in Beshear’s words) “eroding our democracy. ” But while Beshear did it in a       tone, Silva echoed the   slogan “This is not normal. ”  We are living in uncertain times that are completely abnormal, in which the administration constantly questions the media and tries to actively destroy their credibility.  We can’t let these actions become normalized.  It’s hard to imagine Beshear saying those words without provoking   among pundits over whether he might be alienating the white   voters Democrats lost in 2016. It’s equally hard to imagine Silva telling President Trump that “folks here expect you to keep your word. ” For   Americans, Trump keeping his word would be a terrifying prospect. Nationalized elections make code switching really, really hard Here’s the problem: Millions of people who might have really liked Silva’s speech saw Beshear’s instead. They hungered to hear a Democratic attack on Trump; instead, they heard a moderate white governor treat him like a potentially reasonable president with whom Democrats could work on some issues.    Democrats could have done a better job on this, logistically  —   there’s no reason they couldn’t have had Silva   the English translation of her speech and put that out on YouTube to reach a younger audience. (Of course, they couldn’t have prevented progressive activists from watching Beshear’s speech and wondering whether Democrats were really committed to resisting Trump after all.) Parties used to have a much easier time tailoring their messages and positions to the electorate of a particular jurisdiction  —   running socially conservative candidates in West Virginia and   hedge funders in New York. But it’s become clear over the past decade that that strategy has lost its effectiveness. Republicans who beat incumbent Democrats in 2010 and 2014 didn’t run against the incumbent Democrat; they ran against Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi.  And when a Democratic candidate tried to stake out a conservative position on a   issue with a local audience, the effort often got unwanted national attention. The Democrat who challenged Mitch McConnell in Kentucky in 2014, for example, made two separate attempts to run    ads on local radio without national progressives finding out, and ended up getting more attention from    progressives than she probably did from her own voters. The Trump era is still nascent; Democrats don’t have to figure out immediately whether, by the time the 2018 midterms roll around, their core message will be that Trump has been a disappointment or that he must be resisted. But they will have a very hard time delivering both messages simultaneously. Last night’s   experiment aside, the two groups Democrats want to reach aren’t neatly separated. The party has to figure out which one to talk to first. ",-1.0
"Muhammad Wilkerson has another $100M reason to stew. The chances of the Jets and Muhammad Wilkerson agreeing on a   deal were slim heading into this week. Now, they may be zero. The Eagles signed defensive lineman Fletcher Cox on Monday to a   $103 million extension with a possible $63 million guaranteed, making Cox the latest defensive lineman to cash in while Wilkerson waits. The Jets have shown no desire to reward Wilkerson with a big contract before, and now the price tag just went up. There is no way Wilkerson will settle for a penny less than was given to Cox, an inferior player to him. Wilkerson has sat out OTAs and is going to sit out this week’s minicamp. There is a strong possibility he does not show up to training camp on time either. Wilkerson’s protests may not do much, though, as the Jets seem set on not paying him while other teams around the NFL lock up their defensive line talent. There is no question that Wilkerson deserves to be paid like one of the best defensive linemen in the league. Here is a comparison between his first four years in the league ( ) and Cox’s first four years ( ) from Stats, LLC. Wilkerson’s monster 2015 season (12 sacks) is not even part of this comparison. Games: Wilkerson 61, Cox 63  Sacks: Wilkerson 24. 5, Cox 22  Tackles for Loss: Wilkerson 46, Cox 31  QB Hits: Wilkerson 57, Cox 55  Forced Fumbles: Wilkerson 7, Cox 5  Run Stuffs (tackles for negative yards): Wilkerson 27, Cox 15. 5  Impact Tackles (gains of 2 yards or less): Wilkerson 161, Cox 121  Total Tackles: Wilkerson 237, Cox 212 Wilkerson holds the edge in every major category. The Jets’ reluctance to pay him may be because they feel they don’t need him with Sheldon Richardson and Leonard Williams on the team. But, in my opinion, that’s a mistake. It appears the most likely outcome is Wilkerson will play this season under the $15. 7 million franchise tag and then leave as a free agent next year. It is clear NFL teams are willing to spend on elite defensive linemen. Well, teams other than the Jets. One Jets player not getting a lot of attention who is standing out this spring is   pick Jordan Jenkins. The outside linebacker is playing with the   defense and looks like he belongs. Jenkins does not get the hype of the team’s   pick, linebacker Darron Lee, or   pick, quarterback Christian Hackenberg, but Jenkins may wind up with a much bigger role than any of the other rookies this season.",1.0
"The monster deal that makes Giants and Odell Beckham happy. John Mara is on record saying he wants Odell Beckham Jr. to be a Giant For Life. I can only take that to mean the Giants   is not losing much or any sleep over his star player skipping voluntary OTAs, even if Ben McAdoo might be. Mara must not be terribly irked over Beckham failing to catch an opportunity to display a newfound maturity as a key McAdoo   lieutenant.  because it almost always is about the money, so it is more about common cents for Beckham than even common sense. Now, the inmates do not run the Big Blue asylum, and contracts are contracts for a reason. And there is this tiny matter known as the salary cap. There are, however, exceptions to the rule, and Beckham is one of them. The Giants should not even think about playing the   game with Beckham. They should commence negotiations on some kind of extension and show him the money. The only way to make him a Giant For Life is to make him a Wealthy Giant For Life. If Mara wants Beckham to be a Giant For Life, then it is difficult to comprehend that   than the Giants do for terrifying defensive coordinators and catching touchdown passes from Eli Manning. . It would be wrong for the Giants to let a player like this escape from New York. Wide receiver Mike Evans was the seventh player drafted in 2014. The Bucs recently picked up his   option at $14. 7 million. Beckham was the 12th pick that year. The Giants recently picked up his   option at $8. 4 million. The envelope, please: Beckham: 288 catches, 4, 122 yards, 35 TDs. Evans: 238 catches, 3, 578 yards, 27 TDs. Beckham is due to make a $1. 83 million base salary this season. There isn’t anyone who has outplayed his contract more. Does he need to grow up? Yes, he needs to grow up. But Mara is hardly the only Giants fan who wants Beckham to grow up a Giant. While the Patriots have proven you don’t necessarily need a star receiver to win a Super Bowl, Beckham is The Straw That Stirs The Giant Drink, and this is a passing league more than ever. Now, the Giants currently have only $7 million in cap space, and will have to find money for Justin Pugh and Weston Richburg as well, so the Beckham extension would begin in 2018. Antonio Brown has the highest AAV ($17 million). The salary cap, $167 million in 2017, has increased annually by more than $10 million for each of the past four years. A look at the first three years of the following careers: A. J. Green: 260 catches, 3, 833 yards, 29 TDs. Julio Jones: 174 catches, 2, 737 yards, 20 TDs. Brown: 151 catches, 2, 062 yards, 7 TDs. Green was awarded a   $60 million contract after his fourth season with $32. 75 million guaranteed. Jones was awarded a   $71. 25 million contract ($14. 25 million AAV) after his fourth season with $47. 5 million guaranteed. The   option on their   rookie contracts amounted to $10, 176, 000. Dez Bryant was awarded a   $70 million contract ($45M guaranteed, $14M AAV) after his fifth season). Demaryius Thomas was awarded a   $70 million contract ($43. 5M guaranteed, $14M AAV) after his fifth season. A look at their first three years: Bryant: 200 catches, 2, 871 yards, 27 TDs. Thomas: 148 catches, 2, 268 yards, 16 TDs.         Lawrence Taylor held out for three weeks in the 1983 training camp following two otherworldly seasons, and then again for 45 days prior to the 1990 season before the Giants made him the   defensive player ($1. 6 million salary) in the league. The Giants wanted LT, with all his baggage, to be a Giant For Life, and made certain he was. The verdict: Six years, $103 million, $47. 5 million guaranteed, making Beckham the   receiver in the game. Showtime on the field in No. 13. Show Him The Money Time for the Giants. And once they do, it should entail Show Up Time for next year’s OTAs if the head coach wants his star there.",1.0
"Sorry, Mr. Mayor: Oscar Lopez Rivera remains an unrepentant terrorist. Mayor de Blasio says he’ll march in the National Puerto Rican Day Parade despite its honoring of Oscar López Rivera, an unrepentant terrorist leader. The mayor’s trying to dodge that fact. On Wednesday, he spoke of OLR’s ties to the FALN, which “did things I don’t agree with, obviously, and they were illegal. ” But López Rivera wasn’t just affiliated with the FALN terrorists  —   he was a leader of their Chicago cell. And when the FBI arrested him all those years ago, it found dynamite, detonators and firearms in two of his homes. At trial, a witness testified that López Rivera trained him in making bombs. Why does de Blasio claim he has renounced terror? City Hall cites OLR’s words to the Guardian: “We realized other tactics to armed force could be more effective,” followed by “Morally, we came to see . . . that if we are advocating for a better world then there are things you cannot do,” plus, “We have transcended violence. ” None of which repudiates his past actions. And he still scorns the FALN’s victims. In a recent interview, he recalls his attitude toward surviving family members at his 2011 parole hearing: “If you don’t respect me, why should I reciprocate? I wasn’t there to tell them, ‘Hey, listen, I’m sorry.’ That’s not me. ” You see why the NYPD Hispanic Society   and why more sponsors may follow Goya Foods in withdrawing. De Blasio is mayor of a town targeted by the FALN then and by other terrorists now, a city that lost thousands on  . He skipped the St. Patrick’s Day Parade when he thought it sent the wrong message. He ought to do the same now.",1.0
"Behind closed doors, Republican lawmakers fret about how to repeal Obamacare.   PHILADELPHIA  —   Republican lawmakers aired sharp concerns about their party’s quick push to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a   meeting Thursday, according to a recording of the session obtained by The Washington Post. The recording reveals a GOP that appears to be filled with doubts about how to make good on a   promise to get rid of Obamacare without explicit guidance from President Trump or his administration. The thorny issues lawmakers grapple with on the tape  —   including who may end up either losing coverage or paying more under a revamped system  —   highlight the financial and political challenges that flow from upending the current law. Senators and House members expressed a range of concerns about the task ahead: how to prepare a replacement plan that can be ready to launch at the time of repeal; how to avoid deep damage to the health insurance market; how to keep premiums affordable for   families; even how to avoid the political consequences of defunding Planned Parenthood, the women’s   organization, as many Republicans hope to do with the repeal of the ACA.  [In private meeting, Pence vows ‘full’ probe into voter fraud claims]  “We’d better be sure that we’re prepared to live with the market we’ve created” with repeal, said Rep. Tom McClintock ( . ). “That’s going to be called Trumpcare. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we’ll be judged in the election less than two years away. ”      (Jayne   Washington Post)   Recordings of closed sessions at the Republican policy retreat in Philadelphia this week were sent late Thursday to The Post and several other news outlets from an anonymous email address. The remarks of all lawmakers quoted in this story were confirmed by their offices or by the lawmakers themselves. “Our goal, in my opinion, should be not a quick fix. We can do it rapidly  —   but not a quick fix,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( . ). “We want a   solution that lowers costs. ”  [Republicans attempt to hash out   plan]  Sen. Rob Portman ( ) warned his colleagues that the estimated budget savings from repealing Obamacare  —   which Republicans say could approach a   dollars  —   would be needed to fund the costs of setting up a replacement. “This is going to be what we’ll need to be able to move to that transition,” he said. Rep. Pete Sessions ( .) worried that one idea floated by Republicans  —   a refundable tax credit  —   would not work for   families that cannot afford to prepay their premiums and wait for a tax refund. Republicans have also discussed the idea of generating revenue for their plan by taking aim at deductions that allow most Americans to get health insurance through their employers without paying extra taxes on it. Sen. Bill Cassidy ( .) who has drafted his own bill to reform the Affordable Care Act, said in response, “It sounds like we are going to be raising taxes on the middle class in order to pay for these new credits. ” Rep. Kevin Brady ( .) who chairs a key   subcommittee, countered, “I don’t see it that way,” adding that there is “a tax break on   health care and nowhere else” equal to $3. 6 billion over 10 years. “Could you unlock just a small portion at the top to be able to give that freedom [to   Americans]? That is the question,” Brady said. Rep. John Faso ( . Y.) a freshman congressman from the Hudson Valley, warned strongly against using the repeal of the ACA to also defund Planned Parenthood. “We are just walking into a gigantic political trap if we go down this path of sticking Planned Parenthood in the health insurance bill,” he said. “If you want to do it somewhere else, I have no problem, but I think we are creating a political minefield for ourselves  —   House and Senate. ” The concerns of    lawmakers appeared to be at odds with key congressional leaders and Andrew Bremberg, a top domestic policy adviser to Trump, who have laid out plans to repeal the ACA using a   legislative process and executive actions from the administration. However, these leaders acknowledged in Thursday’s meeting, as they have before, that Obamacare cannot be fully undone  —   or replaced  —   without Democratic cooperation. That and other aspects of the unfinished GOP plan prompted several wary lawmakers to urge their leaders to move more deliberately  —   even as the Trump administration appears to be moving ahead with repeal. Thursday, the White House ordered federal health officials to immediately halt all advertising and other outreach activities for the critical final days in which Americans can sign up for 2017 health coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) dismissed the concerns aired in the meeting during an interview at a Politico event Friday. “We have a responsibility to work for the people that put us in office,” he said. “That’s the oath we take: to defend the Constitution, to fight for the people we represent, and this is a fiasco that needs to be fixed. ”    [White House stops ads, outreach for last days of 2017 ACA enrollment]  Of particular concern to some Republican lawmakers was a plan to use the budget reconciliation process  —   which requires only a simple majority vote  —   to repeal the existing law, while still needing a   vote of 60 in the Senate to enact a replacement. “The fact is, we cannot repeal Obamacare through reconciliation,” McClintock said. “We need to understand exactly: What does that reconciliation market look like? And I haven’t heard the answer yet. ” Several important policy areas appeared unsettled. While the chairmen of key committees sketched out various proposals, they did not have a clear plan for how to keep markets viable while requiring insurers to cover everyone who seeks insurance. At one point Cassidy, a physician who   a community health clinic in Baton Rouge to serve the uninsured, asked the panelists a “simple question”: Will states have the ability to maintain the expanded Medicaid rolls provided for under the ACA, which now provide coverage for more than 10 million Americans, and can other states do similar expansions?  “These are decisions we haven’t made yet,” said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden ( . ). Rep. Tom MacArthur ( . J.) worried that the plans under GOP consideration could eviscerate coverage for the roughly 20 million Americans now covered through state and federal marketplaces and the law’s Medicaid expansion: “We’re telling those people that we’re not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them. ” Republicans are also still wrestling with whether Obamacare’s taxes can be immediately repealed, a priority for many conservatives, or whether that revenue will be needed to fund a transition period. And there seems to be little consensus on whether to pursue a major overhaul of Medicaid  —   converting it from an   entitlement that costs federal and state governments $500 billion a year to a fixed block grant. Trump and his top aides, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, have publicly endorsed that idea. But doing so would mean that some   Americans would not be automatically covered by a program that currently covers 70 million Americans. Many of the concerns aired Thursday were more political than  . Faso’s remarks about Planned Parenthood generated tepid applause. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said this month that he expects the House to pursue the organization’s defunding in the reconciliation bill. Those expressing qualms included some of the top congressional leaders who are in line to draft the   legislation. Alexander, for one, is chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Ryan and other leaders have said they intend to pursue a piecemeal approach, following the reconciliation bill with smaller ones that address discrete aspects of reform. Bremberg, chairman of Trump’s domestic policy council, offered little detail in the session about particular executive actions the Trump administration intends to take or what legislative proposals the new president favors. Instead, he pointed to the executive order Trump signed last week, his first, as proof of his commitment to undoing Obamacare’s mandates and said his choice of Rep. Tom Price ( .) to be his health and human services secretary “should speak volumes to people trying to understand what he’s hoping to achieve. ” “This is not a technocrat,” Bremberg said. “This is an experienced, compassionate doctor who has experienced the   system firsthand and who has been a leader here in Washington trying to address the policy reforms that need to take place. Having both of those in a secretary is going to be very important and very powerful. ” Even as Bremberg offered few details about what the president plans to do, he emphasized that last week’s executive order “repeatedly” used phrases “such as ‘to the maximum extent permitted by law’ ” to enable his political appointees to start dismantling the ACA by executive authority. “I’m sure many of us have been very concerned about the interpretation of that phrase in the last six or so years,” Bremberg quipped, referring to the previous administration. “The president has now officially given direction [not only] to HHS, but to all of these agencies that have responsibility . . . to exercise all available discretion to begin helping the American people and to begin fixing our   system. ” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bremberg’s remarks. Faso warned that by defunding Planned Parenthood in the reconciliation bill, “we are arming our enemy in this debate. ” “To me, us taking retribution on Planned Parenthood is kind of morally akin to what Lois Lerner and Obama and the IRS did against tea party groups,” he said, a reference to accusations that the Internal Revenue Service improperly targeted conservative political groups for audits. Faso continued: “Health insurance is going to be tough enough for us to deal with without having millions of people on social media come to Planned Parenthood’s defense and sending hundreds of thousands of new donors to the Democratic Senate and Democratic congressional campaign committees. So I would just urge us to rethink this. ”  Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane contributed to this report. ",-0.5
"Trump shuts the door on men and women who have sacrificed for America.    Matt Zeller is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and the   and chief executive of No One Left Behind    With his latest executive order and immigration ban, President Trump has shut the door on thousands of foreign interpreters, our wartime allies, who have served alongside our military since 2001. As a combat veteran who has served in the U. S. Army, this action deeply disappoints and angers me. I shouldn’t be alive today. I am only here writing this piece because of my Afghan Muslim translator, Janis. He shot and killed two Taliban fighters who nearly ambushed me in a firefight in Afghanistan in 2008. The president’s actions on Friday are troubling for so many reasons. First, the sweeping ban doesn’t take into account that our allied military translators are quite possibly the most vetted individuals aligned with our military. The stringent background checks begin long before they are cleared to work alongside Americans in a combat zone. Then the process for granting the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) which allows them to resettle in the United States, is even more painstaking. To even apply for the SIV, one must meet ALL of the following criteria:  Be a national of Iraq or Afghanistan; and Have worked directly with U. S. armed forces or under Chief of Missions authority as an interpreter for at least 12 months; and Have obtained a favorable, written recommendation from a military or civilian member of the U. S. government.  All this to simply apply for the SIV. To be approved, the interpreter must clear these additional hurdles:• Receive the written nomination; • Prove he or she provided at least 12 to 24 months of honorable and valuable service to the United States war effort; • Prove he or she is under immediate duress due to that service;• And, lastly, pass the most extreme form of vetting the United States can muster  —   a comprehensive national security background investigation completed by every single component of the U. S. national security apparatus (the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency, etc. ). All agencies conduct separate investigations and do not coordinate  . The decision from the national security apparatus must be unanimous, meaning that all the agencies involved must approve the application package. If even one agency dissents on a visa approval, that applicant is barred from entry to the United States and placed on the   list  —   forever. These men and women have served our country honorably  —   in some cases, for more than a decade. A decade of combat service to America, fighting alongside Americans, wearing the same uniforms, bleeding their blood for our country. Is that not the most American thing one could do  —   fight for the ideals they believe in to better one’s country? These wartime allies are   Americans, though they were born half a world away.  Would we deny a man who was injured in multiple improvised explosive device (IED) attacks, repeatedly led U. S. service members through enemy territory safely and fostered local relations? Would we deny a man who is credited with saving five American soldiers lives, including mine? Remember, this man’s name is Janis, and if he were an   veteran, we’d pin medals to his chest and call him a hero.  This ban leaves thousands of our wartime allies to fend for themselves against the very enemies we asked them to fight. Veterans of the Vietnam War speak often of their   injury at having abandoned so many of our Vietnamese allies. Friday, the president cast the same injury upon our newest generation of American veterans and we didn’t get a say. Many of our wartime allies have already been waiting on their visas for years and some, with approved visa in hand, will simply not be able to make it to safety because of the president’s decision.  We are permanently harming the fabric of U. S. national security. Our credibility is forever tarnished if not eroded. Why would any potential ally trust the United States to keep its word again? It pains me to think how many U. S.   will die in future conflicts because we were unable to recruit the local,    support that is often the difference between life and death. These men and women have sacrificed so much for the United States. Friday’s order means the enemy wins, and we have turned our backs on our own ideals.

"Welcome to New Money.  The American economy in 2016 is full of contradictions.    On the one hand, we’re in an era of rapid technological progress. The internet has disrupted industries from retail to music. Emerging technologies like   cars and virtual reality promise to take the trend a step further, creating whole new industries while rendering many conventional jobs obsolete. At the same time, the current recovery has delivered the weakest GDP growth in many decades. Incomes and worker productivity have grown slowly. Despite   interest rates, business investment has been weak ever since the recession ended. So what’s really going on? It’s a question that’s far too big to answer in a single article. In fact, we think it’s big and important enough to be worth its own section at Vox.    We think it’s impossible to really understand the changing economy without a deep understanding of technology. The internet and smartphone have already upended a number of conventional industries. Advocates say a wave of new technologies  —   Bitcoin,   cars, the “internet of things,” and so forth  —   are poised to be even more disruptive. We’ll take a careful look at these emerging technologies, explaining how these technologies work and exploring what they can  —   and can’t  —   do.    And this works in reverse too: The technology sector is strongly affected by larger economic forces.   interest rates have helped fuel Silicon Valley’s investment boom. Crippling housing shortages in the San Francisco Bay Area have limited the growth of technology startups. Decisions made by government regulators will have a big impact on emerging technologies like drones and cryptocurrencies. And broader economic statistics often serve as a   reality check on the relentless hyping of new technologies.  So New Money will explain economics for people who love technology. And we’ll explain technology for people who are fascinated by economics.    Of course, we’ll also track and explain    business stories that have a bearing on these larger questions. This week, for example, I’ll have my eye on the problems at Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo and rumors of an impending sale of Twitter. We’ll cover Apple product introductions, Federal Reserve meetings, and everything in between. But our goal won’t be to break news or provide comprehensive coverage of these topics. Rather, the goal will be to help readers connect the dots between today’s business news and broader technology and economic trends. These are topics I’ve enjoyed writing about for a number of years, and I’m excited to focus on them full time. I hope you enjoy reading about them! You can read the first New Money article here.

"Judge Rejects Uber’s $100 Million Settlement with Drivers. A federal judge has rejected a proposed $100 million settlement between Uber and its drivers in a widely watched lawsuit intended to put the labor practices of the on-demand economy to the test. In an order handed down today in San Francisco, US District Judge Edward Chen said that, despite changes to its policies that Uber was ready to enact, the proposed settlement on the whole “is not fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Had it been approved, the agreement would have impacted about 385,000 Uber drivers California and Massachusetts involved in the class-action suit. At the heart of the case is whether Uber is right to classify its drivers as independent contractors or if the law requires the company to recognize them as true employees. The plaintiffs argued that Uber should classify them as employees, and as such they deserved mileage and tip reimbursement. As independent contractors, drivers today shoulder those expenses themselves. Reclassifying them threatened Uber’s business model by posing the possibility of significant added costs. The settlement amount agreed to by the parties represented a “substantial discount” far below the potential total damages Uber drivers could claim, Chen said. (The plaintiffs calculated the potential damages at more than $850 million.) Complicating matters, Uber had only agreed to guarantee $84 million as a settlement payment to its drivers, with the remaining $16 million contingent on the company’s value growing by one-and-a-half times within a year of its as-yet-unscheduled IPO. As a private startup, Uber is currently valued at $62.5 billion. Because Uber could not prove “a realistic likelihood” that it could achieve the multiple set in the agreement, Chen said he could only consider the $84 million amount in the proposed agreement. Nor was Judge Chen impressed by the policy changes Uber proposed as part of the settlement agreement. Uber had committed to a comprehensive written deactivation policy to address driver complaints that the company kicked drivers off the platform without explanation. Yet under the agreement, Uber would still retain the ability to “temporarily log a driver out of the app for a limited period of time” for any reason. And while Uber has agreed to “clarify” its tipping policy to let riders know they are now allowed to tip drivers, Chen said Uber has so actively discouraged tipping and asked riders to tip using cash—which many may not have on hand, given Uber’s emphasis on cashless payments. Uber, for its part, defended the proposed settlement. “The settlement, mutually agreed by both sides, was fair and reasonable,” Uber spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said in an emailed statement. “We’re disappointed in this decision and are taking a look at our options.” Shannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston attorney representing Uber drivers, has defended the settlement agreement in the past, saying drivers may have risked getting nothing if they were not ready to compromise. In an email to WIRED, she said the possibility of coming up with a new settlement has not yet been ruled out. “It is possible the parties could reach a revised agreement that satisfies the court’s concerns,” she wrote. “But if not, as I’ve said before, I will take the case to trial and fight my hardest for the Uber drivers.” Uber may still go to trial yet. But for now, the status of drivers in today’s 1099 economy remains far from settled. Update on 8:50 PM ET 07/18/2016: This article has been updated to include a response from Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer defending the Uber drivers in the suit.

 Uber has taken people for a lot of rides—two billion, that is, according to CEO Travis Kalanick in a Facebook post today. The milestone comes only six months after Uber said it reached 1 billion rides, an acceleration that highlights the company’s global ambitions, as well as its increasing dependence on the biggest prizein the ride-hailing wars: China. Kalanick said in his post that 147 Uber trips tied for the two billionth ride. These started simultaneously at 4:16 AM GMT in 16 different countries on five continents. The longest ride, a trip in Jakarta, Indonesia, lasted more than an hour, while the shortest was a three-minute trip in Changsha, China. “It took five years to reach our billionth trip, six months to reach the next billion … and we’ll hopefully reach our third even more quickly,” Kalanick wrote. That will depend on how effectively Uber competes in its biggest market, China. According to Reuters, 54 of the 147 trips tied for the two billionth ride took place in China. In fact, five of Uber’s 10 top cities by volume are in the country. Unfortunately for Uber, China is also where it’s embroiled in a fierce battle with homegrown Chinese rival Didi. In January, Didi said it was operating in more than 400 Chinese cities, where analysts estimate it’s captured about 87 percent of the private ride-hailing market. And, oh, Didi earlier this year said it had booked more than 1.4 billion rides in 2015 alone. (That’s not exactly a parallel comparison to Uber since Didi counts taxi rides, carpooling, buses, and corporate rides, among other services, as part of its tally). Both companies are raising an enormous amount of financing to stay ahead in China as they bleed money in operations costs. But even as Uber’s spending has reportedly far outpaced its net revenue, the company is at least clearly leading by a few measures. Uber now has more than $13 billion in its cash pile, and it’s valued at $62.5 billion, compared to Didi’s $25 billion valuation. Add 2 billion rides to that list, and Uber can boast it’s ahead in the numbers game. And for now, that’s the only game Uber is playing. In Silicon Valley-speak, “on demand” means requesting a service—laundry, a ride, a massage—right now. All you have to do is push that button. But of course you still have to wait for the ride to come; no one has figured out (yet) how to make it materialize out of thin air. Now Uber wants to approximate that feeling by letting you schedule your ride ahead of time. When you need it, goes the idea, your ride just appears. Starting today, business travelers in Seattle will be able to schedule rides 30 minutes to 30 days in advance. It’s the first step in what the company says will be a global rollout of the feature. “Even though we’re an on-demand company, we totally get it,” says Tom Fallows, Uber’s director of global experiences. “Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave.” After tapping on UberX in the Uber app, users will see a new option to schedule a ride to within a 15-minute window. You’ll set their pickup date, time, location, and destination, and you’ll be able to edit details up to 30 minutes before the pickup time. You can also cancel anytime without a penalty so long as your ride isn’t already on the way. Uber says it will send you reminders 24 hours ahead of your ride, and again 30 minutes before. Passengers will also get a notification after the ride is on the way that includes, among other information, whether or not surge pricing is in effect. Since surge pricing is a strictly real-time computation, Fallows says, users see only the base fare when they initially order a scheduled ride. But if you’re not willing to pay the surge pricing, you have a five-minute window to cancel without a penalty after the driver is on the way. Wait longer than five minutes and the standard cancellation fee applies. (The amount varies by city: It’s $5 in San Francisco and Seattle, for instance, and 5 euros in Paris.) Meanwhile, the process on the driver’s end remains exactly the same. “The most efficient way to do this by far is for us to send your ride request to the nearest driver at the right moment,” Fallows says. “So from their perspective, it’s a normal ride.” Uber does the technical heavy lifting to decide when to send the ride request out, says Fallows, which includes examining such signals as where all Uber drivers on the network are at that moment; where those drivers are headed and likely to be in the next few minutes; and how long it would take those drivers to arrive at your pickup location. Traffic is another factor, Fallows says, as is the likelihood of a driver accepting your request. Scheduled rides go live today in Seattle, with other “top business travel cities” following soon, according to Uber. At launch, the feature is available only to users who have a business profile set up on the service, and only on the UberX tier. The announcement comes shortly after Uber’s archrival, Lyft, said it was testing a similar feature among its own employees in San Francisco. Lyft said it would like to offer scheduled rides to regular customers but has no definite plan for releasing the feature. A company doesn’t grab the title of world’s most valuable startup by always playing nice. But Uber is eager to show it also has a public-minded side. The ride-hailing giant said today that it had reached a new milestone of recruiting more than 50,000 US veterans as drivers through its UberMILITARY initiative. The company also said it’s donating up to $1 million to organizations that support veterans and their families. “Uber uniquely can be this on-demand income generator,” says Emil Michael, senior vice president of business at Uber. “You can turn the app on and make money, and turn the app off when you have other things to do.” The company launched its UberMILITARY initiative in September 2014 as a way to reach out to veterans and their families. From 2009 to 2011, Michael served as a special assistant to the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, accompanying him to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and elsewhere. He says a central concern among veterans is re-integrating into their communities after leaving the service, and he saw a need for flexible work options—like driving for Uber—while they’re transitioning into more permanent employment.  For the near future, Michael says the company has several more priorities, including paying out as much as a half billion dollars to drivers who have worked or still work in the military by 2020; improving access to military bases; and coming up with a special perks program for veterans who drive on Uber. Robert Isaac Jr., a veteran who’s been driving for Uber in the San Francisco Bay Area for the past two years, said he’s been surprised to find how easy it is to casually talk with passengers about serving in the military—an otherwise difficult topic for him to bring up in other everyday settings.  “Anyone in the military is more than happy to talk about their experiences,” Isaac said during an interview at Uber’s San Francisco headquarters. “We know a kind of separation is there, and we want to close that. We’re just as normal as everyone else—we just did a different kind of job.” After first launching in, of all places, Toronto, the standalone UberEATS app has finally arrived elsewhere in the US. The standalone app has now officially launched in Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco, after it landed in Los Angeles earlier in March. Uber says it will be rolling out UberEATS in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Melbourne, New York, Paris, Seattle and Washington D.C. in the coming weeks. The company made the announcement with a blog post today. The standalone app works just like the Toronto version: You can opt to get regular delivery from a hundred or so restaurants in the area, with the full menu available for you to pick and choose from; UberEATS offers this service from morning until 10 p.m. everyday, and you can see how long it will take for Uber to get the food to your doorstep within the app (15-20 minutes, 20-30 minutes, etc). Or, if you want food delivered to you faster—Uber says as fast as 10 minutes or so—you can choose Instant Delivery, which features three to five daily dishes in every city, all displayed in big, clean photos in the app. Instant Delivery is only offered between 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. during weekdays. “We learned quickly that requesting a ride and ordering a meal are two very different experiences,” Chetan Narain, product manager of UberEATS, writes in the announcement post. “They each deserve their own home.” As we explained when the app first launched in Canada, Uber had to make sure a few things were in order, logistically, for UberEATS to work. Drivers can’t arrive at a restaurant too early and waste precious time hanging around while the food is still being prepared; they also can’t arrive too late, and risk the food being served cold. Uber says its map-routing algorithms help so that drivers get to the restaurant at the right time, hitting the sweet spot. There’s also a separate driver base handling UberEATS deliveries, which doesn’t overlap with the group of regular Uber drivers picking up people in their cars. (Drivers can choose to switch between modes freely, by logging into and out of the app.) According to Uber, the partnerships with Instant Delivery restaurants require special arrangements, including a scheduled pickup at the restaurant before 11 a.m. hits. Meanwhile, regular UberEATS delivery is done more ad hoc: orders come through the app, and drivers drive to the restaurants to pick up the food, then bring them to the customer. Uber declined to provide details on how it and participating restaurants split the revenue they bring in, but one can imagine how agreeing to be listed on Uber’s app wins these restaurants some high-tech local advertising. Update at 2PM ET 03/15/16: This story has been updated to clarify that UberEATS officially launched in several US cities today, after first coming to LA earlier in March. US ride-sharing company Uber is trying to succeed in unfamiliar countries, and it needs to make some local friends to help. Enter LetterOne, an international investment firm established by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, which just made a strategic $200 million investment in Uber, the world’s most valuable private startup. The move, announced  on Friday, is meant to help Uber wade even further into emerging markets. LetterOne, founded in 2013 and based in Luxembourg, has typically focused on the telecoms and energy sectors—areas that Fridman has historically invested in. But more recently, the company has been seeking to invest in “late-stage technology growth opportunities globally,” according to the company’s release. Uber fits in well with this vision, and benefits from the deal in other ways. While the ride-hailing giant dominates the market in the US, it has lagged behind other players abroad, coming in second to Didi Kuaidi in China, Ola in India, and Grab in Southeast Asia. And these players, along with Lyft, Uber’s biggest ride-hailing rival in the US, have already moved to form a global anti-Uber alliance. This partnership, the company says, will help Uber boost its local knowledge of many emerging markets. “Our goal is simple: reliable and affordable transportation everywhere, for everyone, at the push of a button,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in the announcement. In other words, if Uber truly wants to dominate globally, it must adapt to local climates and their unique quirks—something a local partner can help with tremendously, especially in emerging markets. In India and the Philippines, for example, Uber allows passengers to pay with cash because it works better with the culture. And yes, $200 million may not sound like much for a company reportedly valued at upwards of $60 billion. But in Uber’s greater quest for world domination, a strategic partner may have more value than the specific monetary value of the investment itself. Uber has agreed to settle two class-action lawsuits over its safety-related advertising.  The ride-hailing giant has agreed to pay $28.5 million to around 25 million US passengers who rode in Ubers from January 2013 to January 2016, according to a settlement agreement submitted for court approval today. Among the issues was how it advertised its one-dollar “Safe Rides Fee.” After attorney fees and administrative costs, passengers who qualify for the payout can expect to each receive a grand total of 82 cents or so. At issue is how company described driver background checks (“industry leading”) as well as how it implemented the fee beginning in April 2014. Because other kinds of background checks are actually more rigorous, the suits alleged, the language was misleading—and riders shouldn’t have to pay the fee. Uber said the fee was a way to recover some of its costs in running its background checks, as well as provide 24/7 support to its riders in the event of safety issues. In the settlement, however, the company has agreed to avoid using certain language to describe these operations. From now on, the company says, it will call the “Safe Rides Fee” a “Booking Fee” instead.  “Accidents and incidents do happen,” Uber wrote in a blog post detailing the settlement. “That’s why it’s important to ensure the language we use to describe safety at Uber is clear and precise.” A federal judge will still have to approve the settlement. To be clear, Uber is changing only the language around its fee, not getting rid of it. San Francisco-based Lyft, Uber’s closest rival in the US, has had similar issues (it now calls its “Trust and Safety Fee” a “Trust and Service Fee”). But the processes themselves that led to these complaints are still in place.  That’s because ridesharing, as with anytime you get into a car with a stranger, comes with a certain amount of inherent risk. Uber has faced its share of publicity over drivers with criminal records finding their way onto its platform. In settling the suit, Uber gets at least some litigation off its plate. But its lawyers still have plenty of work to do. French taxi unions and Uber are clashing again. Taxi drivers in France have once more gone on strike—shutting down roads, demonstrating across Paris, and blocking access to major airports and railway stations, according to French media reports. At least 2,000 drivers took part in the protests, and police have arrested 20 so far. The latest demonstrations coincided with a broader nationwide demonstration against France’s government, including a walkout by air traffic controllers that disrupted flights and a protest by teachers during the school day. But according to journalists on the ground, the taxi protests were by far the most volatile: Security forces reportedly fired teargas at crowds to try to maintain order, and television footage in western Paris showed demonstrators burning tires and blocking several lanes of traffic. Taxi unions say Uber and other ride-hailing apps create unfair competition and are not adequately policed. “Unfortunately, the governments are weak and as unemployment is pressuring them, they give in,” Karim Asnoun, head of the CGT taxi union, told The Guardian. “They think they are creating jobs, whereas for every created job there is one that’s destroyed.” Uber, meanwhile, reportedly emailed its French users, describing the strike as an attack on the market for ride-hailing apps in France and asked its users to lend their support to help ease regulations in the country. Uber France spokesman Thomas Meister told The Verge that, unlike previous strikes, today’s demonstration isn’t specifically aimed at Uber but rather targets “the general organization and structure of the industry.”  But as Uber well knows, its strategy to make its way in France—and other parts of the world—hasn’t gone over smoothly in the past. If the problem truly is cultural, as it increasingly appears to be, Uber would do well to figure out how to run its business on France’s terms—or risk facing a bumpier road than ever when it comes to trying to take over the world. Ride-hailing giant Uber says it’s using smartphone gyrometer data to double-check if drivers on its platform are speeding. At least, it does for a portion of its drivers on a new pilot program. Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer, explained that the tactic is meant to corroborate whether a low “star rating” from a passenger may have stemmed from how fast their Uber driver was going. “If the rating is low, we ask why,” Sullivan said. “We need to check what actually happened. Mostly it’s about talking to both sides. But increasingly technology can help get to the truth.” Sullivan says the measure is part of a mix of methods to address road safety. In North Carolina, the company has provided Bop It toys in the backs of drivers’ cars to keep drunk passengers entertained, according to the company—though some have pointed out that the strategy of treating passengers like children could come off as insulting.  Some drivers in Seattle, meanwhile, are using color-coded lights to help riders find the right car at night. In the future Sullivan says Uber could use gyrometer data to verify whether drivers were constantly messing with their phones and offer them smartphone mounts. There’s no doubt that safety is important. But to Uber’s critics, all that monitoring might seem to give Uber more control over its drivers than it ought to have, given the company’s stance that its drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Some drivers have already alleged that anything below a 4.6 average rating can get them deactivated from the system. Now, it seems, Uber is looking to have even greater oversight. In San Francisco, the birthplace of Uber, the largest traditional taxi company has filed for bankruptcy. But Yellow Cab Cooperative doesn’t call out the ride-hailing giant as the reason for its woes. Instead, the company said that lawsuits filed by passengers had finally forced it to restructure its business. Last year, The San Francisco Chronicle reported, a San Francisco Superior Court jury found that the company was liable for a crash allegedly caused by a Yellow Cab driver. The jury awarded $8 million to the injured passenger. Not that the Ubers of the world are immune from such pressures. In one tragic instance, an Uber driver on New Year’s Eve 2013 ran into a family in a San Francisco crosswalk, killing a 6-year-old girl and seriously injuring her mother and brother. In July, Uber reached a settlement with the family, the terms of which were kept confidential.  But ride-hailing services do have an advantage over traditional taxi companies, at least for now, in the form of billions of dollars in funding. Yellow Cab declined to comment on whether competitive pressures from app-based services like Uber were a factor in its filing. Uber wants you to believe it’s emerged as the global leader in the world of on-demand rides. To be sure, some signs do already point to that: it’s raised more than $10 billion in venture funding, and the company’s worth a reported $62.5 billion. Still, it would be shortsighted to assume Uber has the edge in every aspect of the fight, especially in one of the biggest battlegrounds for ride-hailing thus far: China. Last December, Uber announced a metric seemingly designed to let everyone know that it was absolutely killing it: it had hit 1 billion rides worldwide since the company launched in 2009. Not to be outdone, today Didi Kuaidi—Uber’s biggest rival in China—announced that it booked 1.43 billion rides—in 2015 alone. That figure, first reported by tech news blog Re/code, is certainly enormous. Didi Kuaidi further claims that it completed 200 million rides in December, and added that Uber’s billion rides came only after six years of maturation and an aggressive global expansion—while Didi Kuaidi operated only in China in 2015. On the other hand, though, Didi Kuaidi admits it tallied its rides from seven different services it offers, including private cars, taxis, carpooling, buses, and corporate services, among others. So it’s not quite fair to compare those reported numbers directly with Uber’s tally. But the announcement speaks to the overarching message Didi Kuaidi badly wants to project: that it’s far ahead of everyone else in China. Period. According to research from the China Internet Network Information Center, Didi Kuaidi holds 87.2 percent of the private car-hailing market in the world’s most populated country. Its user base in the country exceeds 250 million people. And it holds this majority in spite of the fact that five of Uber’s top 10 cities by ride volume are in China. Uber, for its part, has long made it clear that it considers the country to be a central piece of its strategy for growing its ride-hailing business globally. Just today The Wall Street Journal reported that the company poured fresh new funds into its China unit that would value it at $7 billion. Didi Kuaidi isn’t retreating from its ambitions to capture a meaningful share of the worldwide ride-hailing market, either. Last fall, the company announced a partnership with Lyft that would link the companies’ apps and let Didi users traveling to the US to hail rides on Lyft’s platform, and vice versa. In December, Didi Kuaidi and Lyft’s alliance expanded to include the ride-hailing leaders in India and Southeast Asia, Ola and GrabTaxi. Together, that global coalition will reach nearly 50 percent of the world’s population, according to the companies. Joint partner projects are scheduled to start rolling out in the first quarter of 2016. So yes, it’s true that Didi Kuaidi’s 1.43 billion rides is yet another boastful metric and an incremental development among many others as ride-hailing companies fight to come out on top all over the world. But with the winds of favor constantly shifting for these companies, one thing’s for sure: no one player can—or should—take its dominance in the market for granted. The global anti-Uber alliance is growing. Today US-based Lyft said it was allying itself with Asia-based ride-hailing companies Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi, and Ola. Together, the alliance will reach nearly 50 percent of the world’s population, Lyft said. “We’re excited to join with Didi, Grab, and Ola to make global travel simpler for passengers,” Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer said. “This isn’t solely a partnership of four companies, but also an opportunity to have a greater impact on the future of our cities worldwide.” The massive global coalition has been a long time coming. Back in September, Lyft and Didi Kuaidi, China’s biggest homegrown Uber rival, joined to allow Lyft users visiting China to book Didi drivers from the Lyft app, and vice versa. Now, users of any of these apps will be able to order rides where the other ride-hailing partners are based. (Each company will still handle mapping, routing, and payments in the countries in which they operate.) Ola is the leading ride-hail company in India. GrabTaxi, meanwhile, offers services in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand. Each of the companies says it receives more than a million booking requests a day. Together, they make a seemingly formidable force. Each provides the other an apparently easy way to make inroads in new countries where a preferred service already exists, and quickly achieve scale. In doing so, the alliance would also seem to help these startups go up against the global juggernaut that is Uber. The world’s largest ride-hailing company operates in 67 countries, and it’s still growing at a rapid clip thanks to billions in funding from optimistic investors. Though no financial details have been divulged in the announcement, the companies revealed their plan to leverage the partnership in other ways. Joint partner products—which might include courier services, food delivery, and other logistics services—will start rolling out in the first quarter of 2016, the group said. Bloomberg is reporting that Uber is attempting to raise as much as $2.1 billion in a financing round that would value the car company at $62.5 billion. It cites sources who shared paperwork filed privately in Delaware. If true, the move comes just months after a private funding round that valued the company at more than $50 billion, and it propels the company into the position of the world’s most valuable privately held startup. It will bring Uber’s total venture funding to $12 billion. In its final funding round, 17 months before going public, Facebook was valued at $50 billion. At the time, that figure was considered eye-popping. Despite the massive valuation, founder and CEO Travis Kalanick has no immediate plans for an initial public offering. Speaking at a tech conference in October, he said Uber was still in its “junior high” stage of development. He said talk of going public now is like “telling us to go to the prom.” A Florida state agency that had earlier ruled that an ex-Uber driver was an employee has reversed its decision after Uber appealed the case. In May, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity found that former Uber driver Darrin McGillis was an employee, not an independent contractor, when he drove for the ride-hailing company for seven months until April 2015. The state agency resolves claims on unemployment benefits, and in siding with McGillis, allowed him to claim them. Independent contractors don’t usually get such benefits—in exchange for the flexibility of choosing their own shifts, the independent classification means they don’t receive Social Security, Medicare, or workers’ compensation, along with unemployment insurance. Uber appealed the May decision; after a telephone hearing in August, the agency published a new 9-page finding in Uber’s favor. It’s worth noting that this is yet another isolated decision by a single state agency; it only applies to the claimant either way. Florida’s ruling in May was the first time a state agency sided with an ex-Uber driver, and others have followed suit in California. Agencies in nine other states, meanwhile, have sided with Uber that drivers were independent contractors, not employees. But none of these individual decisions carry the weight of court precedent. Uber’s more important battle is a federal class-action lawsuit currently under way in California, in which thousands of California Uber drivers are seeking recognition as employees of the company. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the labor lawyer who is representing the Uber drivers, has mentioned the state agency decisions in her arguments in court in the past, saying the rulings strengthen her side’s stance. But now it seems, there’s one less decision she’ll be able to cite. // <![CDATA[

 Uber is the world’s most valuable startup—now valued at close to $51 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal—and the undisputed king of the ride-hailing industry. At least at the moment. But outside the US, where Uber is most aggressively seeking growth, its overseas rivals are increasingly banding together in a bid to hamper its rapid expansion. On Monday, Reuters reported that Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Kuaidi had invested in Ola, the biggest ride-summoning app in India. The amount was not disclosed, though the Times of India, citing unnamed sources, previously reported that Didi Kuaidi’s stake in the company would be around $30 million. Ola confirmed the investment to WIRED but not the amount. Didi Kuaidi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Didi Kuaidi’s investment comes right on the heels of the announcement of its partnership with US-based Lyft. Earlier in the month in New York, the two companies revealed they would link their apps. Lyft users traveling in China could hail Didi Kuaidi drivers from their Lyft app, and vice versa. The feature is set to go live by early 2017. But the partnership appears to go beyond apps. Didi Kuaidi also reportedly invested $100 million in Lyft earlier this year. It has also invested in the Singapore-based ride-hailing company GrabTaxi. All of this cooperation among Uber’s rivals signals the emergence of consolidation as the key strategy for challenging the global juggernaut that is Uber. As Uber’s most formidable competitor in China—the company’s most coveted market—Didi Kuaidi is in a prime position to lead this charge, and it’s not shying away from the task. Consolidation is also in the interest of Uber rivals’ deep-pocketed investors. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, for instance, have a stake in Didi Kuaidi and Lyft, and Japan-based SoftBank has investments in Ola and Didi Kuaidi. Uber has made no secret of wanting to own the Chinese market, recently raising $1.2 billion in fresh funding to pour into its China operations. It has also expressed a special interest in India, now the world’s fastest growing major economy. But its rivals are determined to create at least a few bumps along Uber’s road to global dominance. The slew of worker misclassification lawsuits filed against on-demand companies just won’t stop. On Wednesday, class-action complaints were filed against on-demand food delivery companies DoorDash and GrubHub in California state court, alleging that the drivers should not be considered independent contractors, as their companies have deemed them, but official employees. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Boston-based labor lawyer, filed the suits against the two companies, seeking class action status. She also brought forward a complaint in arbitration against Caviar, a curated food delivery service owned by Jack Dorsey’s company Square. The Caviar complaint is a little different in that Liss-Riordan represents only one San Francisco driver. After filing a class action complaint against Caviar earlier this year, Liss-Riordan explains, the court ruled that the arbitration clause in Caviar’s written agreement was enforceable, requiring workers to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process, per complaint, rather than lumping the cases together in a class-action suit. “There’s a lot of commonality among these cases,” Liss-Riordan tells WIRED. “Companies basically hope to massively save on labor costs by classifying their workers as independent contractors rather than employees.” That brings the tally of companies Liss-Riordan has brought complaints against to 11, which includes on-demand ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, laundry service Washio, home services Homejoy and Handy, grocery delivery service Instacart, and on-demand delivery services Postmates and Shyp, in addition to DoorDash, GrubHub and Caviar. So far, only the case against Uber has been certified as a class action. Of these companies, a couple—Instacart and Shyp—have reclassified part of its workforce in what looks to be a reaction to pressure from these filings. One company, Homejoy, shut down, citing the suits as a “deciding factor” in the decision. The class-action suits against on-demand ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft are the furthest along in the process. On September 1, a federal judge in San Francisco granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by three Uber drivers against the on-demand ride company. (Uber is appealing that decision.) Lyft, meanwhile, faces a similar suit, with its class certification hearing in December. “All of these companies seem to be watching what other companies are doing,” Liss-Riordan says, “and thinking they can get away with it.” You can read the complaints filed against DoorDash, GrubHub and Caviar below. // <![CDATA[

Doordash Grubhub Caviar Complaints (PDF) Doordash Grubhub Caviar Complaints (Text)
 Uber on Tuesday filed to appeal a ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco to grant class-action status to a lawsuit brought by three Uber drivers against the on-demand ride company. On September 1, US District Judge Edward Chen decided that Uber drivers in California could join the case seeking mileage and tip reimbursement from the company. The drivers can also collectively challenge the company on the main issue of worker misclassification—whether they should be considered employees of Uber under the law, rather than independent contractors—which could have far-reaching implications for the on-demand economy’s basic business model. The lawsuit against Uber is the furthest along of a slew of recent cases against on-demand companies, including Lyft, Caviar, Postmates and Homejoy, among others. These startups employ freelance contractors, or 1099 contract workers, instead of employees, arguing that this can make the work more flexible than a structured, 9-to-5 job. But as of late, critics have been calling for better protection for these workers, who lack benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, and workers’ compensation. Others, meanwhile, also point out that companies who employ this business model stand to save on payroll taxes, undercutting other on-demand tech firms who do make an effort to classify their workers as employees. Uber has largely stuck to the same arguments it used in court. It is “manifestly erroneous” that the suit has been certified as a class, the company says, because there is no such thing as a typical Uber driver. That lumps the issues of thousands of drivers into a single suit, Uber argues, whereas there are substantial differences in how drivers use its platform. Beyond that, the company insists, converting Uber drivers to employees would cost the drivers the flexibility they love, because it upends Uber’s business model. The appeal (see below) is worth perusing in full. But in case you’d like to skip to the juiciest parts, we’ve added comments to the document for extra context.

2015 09 15 as Filed O’Connor Rule 23(F) Petition (Text) Ride-hailing giant Uber has lost another battle in the incendiary debate over whether or not its drivers should be considered employees. Officials at California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) recently determined that an ex-Uber driver qualified as an employee of the company, not an independent contractor, and as such was entitled to unemployment benefits. To be sure, it’s one decision by one state agency and only applies to one individual. But an administrative law judge backed the decision on appeal, and Uber ultimately decided not to fight further. “We disagreed with the decision, but since it only affects one person …we decided to focus on the bigger picture,” an Uber spokesperson tells WIRED. That bigger picture is a federal lawsuit filed against Uber that was granted class-action status earlier this month seeking to gain Uber drivers recognition as employees of the company, not independent contractors. This latest decision is not the first time a state agency has determined an Uber driver was an employee. In May, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity found that Uber driver Darrin McGillis was an Uber employee and thus eligible for unemployment insurance. In June, the California Labor Commission, which investigates wage claims, decided that ex-Uber driver Barbara Ann Berwick was entitled to unpaid wages and reimbursement for business expenses in the nine weeks she worked as an Uber driver last year. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston lawyer who is representing the Uber drivers in the class-action suit against the company, has cited the California Labor Commission’s decision in her arguments in court. She says this and other decisions by state agencies solidify her side’s stance. “This California decision supports our argument that when a fact-finder sits down to look at the facts, and applies California laws, Uber drivers are employees,” Liss-Riordan says. For its part, Uber says that other states have determined Uber drivers are independent contractors rather than employees of the company, including labor or unemployment boards in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Indiana, Texas, New York, Illinois, and California—where at least one decision, the company says, came from the EDD itself. Back in February, Uber announced a strategic partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s robotic research group: an initiative the ride-hailing service said was meant to help it develop driverless-car technology. Now, in an apparent move to deepen that alliance, Uber has just revealed that it is giving $5.5 million to the university to support a new robotics faculty chair as well as sponsor three graduate fellowships. “We’re pumped to be part of a growing innovation ecosystem in Pittsburgh that includes world leading research institutions and companies, as well as an increasing number of start-ups,” Travis Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, said in a blog post announcing the endowment. It’s an interesting move from Uber, the undisputed giant of ride-hailing apps, and a company that has gained notoriety for its obsession with growth. Even after five years, the company is still expanding rapidly; in spite of regulatory hurdles, it’s still muscling its way into new markets, both in the US and abroad. But another reason for Uber’s outpouring of generosity could be its, ahem, unique relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Not too long after the announcement of their partnership, according to several reports, Uber hired away dozen’s of CMU’s scientists, leaving one of the world’s top robotics institutions in a crisis. Some viewed Uber luring these researchers away as a good thing, certifying the academic institution as a place of opportunity. Indeed, Uber has provided desirable jobs to researchers from other, more unconventional sources in the past, including hiring the two hackers who wirelessly hijacked an Internet-connected Jeep. But others may see the move more as a way to make amends with Carnegie Mellon. And certainly, with competitors like Google bearing down on Uber’s as-yet-unattained dream “to make transportation as reliable as running water” (read: self-driving cars), the ride-hailing giant needs all the allies it can get. Uber may have finally found a friend in New York City’s government after all. Today, the city’s Comptroller, Scott Stringer, wrote in a post on Medium that the City Council should postpone its vote on a bill that would temporarily cap the number of new driver licenses available to companies like Uber and Lyft. An arbitrary cap on for-hire vehicles is not the answer – we need to think strategically about our transport networks http://t.co/QzSI8Q9yoW — Scott M. Stringer (@scottmstringer) July 21, 2015  The city’s plan calls for studying the impact of ride-hailing services on traffic congestion before approving new licenses. But Stringer says that approach gets it all backwards. The plan, he says, “seems to ignore the fact that so many other factors — from economic growth to street design — affect congestion.” Stringer said in a speech today he had met with David Plouffe, the political strategist who has been leading Uber’s campaign against the bill, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has fiercely defended. But the comptroller didn’t let Uber completely off the hook, writing that both Uber and the city need to come to the negotiating table. “We must take a close look at wage standards in the shared economy,” Stringer wrote, “and reexamine the City’s traditional cab drivers and their working conditions, which for decades have been defined by long hours, low wages, and few, if any benefits.” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wants you to know that Uber is great. So great, in fact, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio should abandon any effort to cap the company’s growth. The mayor has called for a limit to the number of licenses available to ride-sharing companies like Uber while the city studies the impact of the influx of car services on traffic. Uber is vociferously opposed to the idea—the company’s New York general manager even challenged de Blasio to a public live-streamed debate. (The mayor declined.) Now, Kalanick has taken to Twitter, a time-honored tactic in his company’s frequent battles with city governments. Once a singularly outspoken tweeter, Kalanick has quieted as Uber’s value has skyrocketed. But over the past week, via a storm of retweets, he’s made sure to call out the stories and anecdotes that appear to support Uber’s side (including at least one WIRED story).

According to one Uber-funded study released today, they do. Research group Botec Analysis found that summoning an UberX, the company’s budget tier, took less than half as long as calling for a taxi in several low-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles. What’s more, the trips themselves cost less than half as much. Calling for an UberX was more reliable and wait times were shorter, according to the study. “The answer was clear-cut, and consistent across neighborhoods and days,” writes study co-author Mark Kleiman. To gather data, pairs of riders called for a taxi and an Uber along pre-planned routes. The riders recorded the time between picking up the phone or opening an app and getting in a car. They also tracked how much each ride cost, then switched off. After each ride, whoever took a taxi last time took an Uber next time. Kleiman says the riders didn’t know Uber had funded the effort but acknowledged that Uber’s backing “makes some skepticism about our results natural and proper.” “We would be happy to share our data and methods with other research teams for re-analysis and replication,” he says. More independent study of the issue is a good idea. Kleiman acknowledges that his study didn’t address many of the most trenchant questions around transit: the ethnicity of riders; riders with disabilities; or the lack of access for riders who don’t have credit cards or smartphones. He says, “This study ought to be the beginning of the scientific effort rather than the end.” New York City’s Mayor Bill de Blasio is pushing a bill in the City Council that would put a cap on the number of driver’s licenses available to companies like Uber … and now Uber is lashing out at the Mayor in the best way it knows how: through the Uber app. Uber has added a fake “de Blasio” feature to its app, which is visible only to New York City Uber users. Cars are plentiful in UberPOOL and UberX mode, but on de Blasio mode, the map simply says “No cars available.” Users who click on that message are greeted with another: “This is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio’s Uber cap bill passes.”  The City Council is expected to vote on the bill, which the de Blasio administration argues would curb traffic congestion in the city, by next week. So it’s no surprise that Uber has also been buying up commercials on local television, with testimonies from hardworking drivers asking New Yorkers to protest the bill. Watch below:  During my last business trip, I skipped rental cars and cabs and took Ubers everywhere—they were just so cheap! Turns out I wasn’t the only one. Today, expense software company Certify released its lastest data on how business travelers are spending money. Their report found that for the first time, travelers used Uber more than traditional taxis. Uber accounted for 55 percent of ground transportation receipts submitted by employees versus 43 percent for taxis. (About 1 percent of receipts were for Lyft rides and another 1 percent for other ride-hailing services.) That’s a reversal from last quarter, when Uber had 46 percent of the receipts versus 53 percent for taxis. The spike in Uber use is also taking a chunk out of the rental car business, according to the report. In the second quarter of 2014, 55 percent of people rented a car while traveling on business; that figure dropped by 10 percent during the same period this year. The receipts don’t lie, Certify says: “Uber is fast evolving to become the preferred choice of business travelers for ground transportation.”",0.0
"How to put the Middle East back together.   SARI RASH, Iraq  This month marks the 100th anniversary of the   Agreement that formed Iraq, Syria and the other fragile nations of the modern Middle East. The past few weeks have provided dramatic new evidence, if more were needed, that the old colonial framework created by Britain and France isn’t working.  David Ignatius writes a    foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive   Facebook RSS   Iraq and Syria are coming apart: Iraq is effectively divided into three warring regions: a Sunni area ruled by the Islamic State, a Kurdish   that’s nearly autonomous, and a zone from the capital south that’s controlled by the   regime. A similar fragmented structure exists in Syria. Central government in both countries has vanished.  From his mountain headquarters here overlooking Irbil, Kurdish national security adviser Masrour Barzani offers a frank judgment in an interview: “For 100 years, a system has been in place in Iraq that has now failed. Iraq was never built on the right foundations. It was built to serve the interests of the great powers. A hundred years of failure is enough. We need to look at new options. ” A similar sense that Iraq and the region are at a crossroads is expressed by Barham Salih  a former prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government and former deputy prime minister of Iraq. We talked in Sulaymaniyah, 90 miles southeast of here, where he now runs the American University of  .   After months of tensions, the political crisis in Iraq escalated with   protesters storming into parliament. This is why they are protesting. (Claritza   Washington Post)   “This is not about a government reshuffle,” argues Salih. “The   political system put in place by the U. S. is unraveling. This is a new era. The choice is between a chaotic breakdown into warlordism or, possibly, a new constitutional arrangement that would create a more decentralized, confederal Iraq. ” During my visit to Iraq, I heard similar views from every Kurdish leader I met, and from some Sunnis, too. Iraq and Syria are at an inflection point, they argued. The immediate priority is to defeat the Islamic State. But the United States should be talking with its allies about a future political structure  —   an alternative to the “lines in the sand” drawn by Sir Mark Sykes and François   and to the United States’   misadventure in neocolonialism.  For a model of how the United States should think creatively about fixing this catastrophe, look at American policy in 1944. Victory in World War II was still a   year away. But President Franklin D. Roosevelt had the foresight to begin thinking carefully about the institutions that would maintain peace and prosperity after the war. By the end of that year, detailed planning had begun for the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations.  Here’s a challenge for the rest of President Obama’s term and the first months in office of the next president: Start building the foundations for a new order in the Middle East that can provide better security, governance and economic    —   for Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, and for the smaller minorities that are interwoven in the fabric of the region. Help the peoples of this shattered region build and maintain governance structures that work.  The Kurds may force the question soon, with a referendum that will ask their people whether they want an independent Iraqi Kurdistan. The United States should support such a process, but if  —   and only if  —   it’s created through a negotiated agreement with the central government in Baghdad. Many Sunni and Shiite leaders in Iraq have told me privately they favor a new constitution for a confederal Iraq that would include a Sunni regional government, as well as a Kurdish one. A similar negotiation for a loose federal or confederal Syria should be part of the political transition there, too.  Trying to hammer the pieces into unitary states just won’t work. America tried and failed in Iraq. Now, Iran, too, finds itself unable to maintain order there. That’s the lesson of last week’s mayhem in the   Iraqi parliament, which was largely an internal    quarrel. “The Iranians are making the same mistakes the U. S. did after 2003,” explains one prominent Iraqi. “They went in too heavy. They thought they could do it all. But the Shiite monolith is breaking down. ”  Fixing a shattered Middle East is the work of a generation. But it’s past time for the United States, Europe, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran to start thinking urgently with the people of Syria and Iraq about new structures that will finally cure the mistakes and injustices of a century ago.

"Why Rex Tillerson’s comments on the South China Sea have Chinese state media up in arms.  Anxiety in China has been mounting for some time over continued provocations from the incoming Trump administration. Now Chinese   media outlets have started sounding the alarm in response to comments by Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state, about taking unprecedented steps against China’s territorial claims in the hotly disputed South China Sea.     ”If Trump’s diplomatic team shapes future   ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash,” said one particularly belligerent editorial in the Chinese   Global Times newspaper. During his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, the former ExxonMobil CEO said China’s quest to dominate the South China Sea with an   naval presence and construction of artificial islands was “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea. ”  He also described taking bold and new steps to prevent China from accessing those islands, some of which have runways large enough for jumbo jets and now appear to have   guns and missile defense systems on them.    “We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops,” Tillerson said. “And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed. ”         Tillerson’s comments represent a dramatic break from current US policy, which is why they are causing serious anxiety in China.     Tillerson offered no clarity on how the US would deny China access to these islands, but it raises the real possibility of a blockade  —   something that is commonly regarded as an act of war. And China’s   media is making it clear that that is exactly how Beijing would see it.     ”Unless Washington plans to wage a   war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish,” said an editorial in the Global Times, a Chinese   publication. The   editorial was unabashed in discussing the possibility of a massive confrontation. ”Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,” it said.  Global Times is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper group of the ruling Communist Party. Its hawkish bravado doesn’t necessarily represent the party’s official line, but ultimately the publication is sanctioned by the state.      And Jessica Chen Weiss, a scholar of Chinese foreign relations and author of a book on Chinese nationalism, says we should take it seriously. “It’s not just the Global Times but a range of state media in China that are warning against what Tillerson implied, which is a blockade,” Weiss explains. “If the US tries to prevent China from accessing its outposts with a blockade, China is likely to respond with military force. ” There’s a lot at stake for China The government’s official response has been more restrained. In response to Tillerson’s comments, Lu Kang, spokesperson at China’s foreign ministry, said “China has full right to conduct all lawful activities within its own sovereign zone. ”  That’s a typical statement. But Kang refrained from speculating on what would happen if Tillerson were confirmed and successfully shifted US policy to set up some kind of actual blockade, saying he “cannot comment on Mr Tillerson’s personal comments or make a projection on China’s policies   …     we don’t answer hypothetical questions. ” But the South China Sea is of huge strategic importance to China. More than a third of global maritime traffic passes through it, it has proven oil reserves of 7 billion barrels, and it provides crucial outposts for projecting military power. The body of water has been a major hot spot for the countries that flank it for centuries, but in the last few years China’s hunger for territory there has grown considerably.  Washington has promised to continuing sending US Navy vessels through the South China Sea and to ignore Beijing’s     zone there. In practice, though, the US has taken no substantive steps to curtail Beijing’s aggressive land grab in the South China Sea and hasn’t helped enforce an international tribunal’s recent ruling that China’s territorial claims there are illegal.    So what would happen if the US did use ships to set up a blockade?  “At a minimum, China would try to defy the blockade, but it could actually use limited force if it felt sufficiently threatened and wanted to send a signal,” Weiss says. “It would all depend on the details on the water, which are hard to glean from one sentence in Tillerson’s remarks. ” Tillerson hasn’t yet been confirmed, nor is it clear that if he were to be confirmed, he would continue to advocate for that exact policy once he takes the post. But it’s worth noting that he does seem to have a bit of a history of pushing China’s buttons. Under his watch, ExxonMobil was unusually bold when it went exploring for new business in the South China Sea. As the Financial Times reports:  “When Mr Tillerson was chief executive of ExxonMobil, it was one of the few large international oil and gas groups willing to explore alongside Vietnam in waters also claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea. Others pulled out of possible collaborations with the Vietnamese in these contested waters, after coming under pressure from Beijing. ” That kind of background may make Tillerson more willing to challenge China than would someone with no experience testing Beijing.  But the Chinese government has little reason to back down in such a  . For them, it’s not just about foreign policy matter  —   but also a question of domestic survival.    “Even regular US Freedom of Navigation patrols near the artificial islands exposed the Chinese government to popular criticism for not defending Chinese interests staunchly enough,” Weiss says. “A blockade would likely be seen as a more serious challenge to Chinese sovereignty, likely putting nationalist pressure on Xi Jinping from the public. ” The Chinese Communist Party needs to make sure it looks tough in order to ward off the possibility of major discontent  —   or even unrest  —   at home. It would suffer political losses for appearing to cave to a bully. If the Trump administration continues to engage in   expect China to continue to come back just as hard. ",-1.0
"The toughest place to smoke weed in NYC. It’s the toughest place to toke in New York City. A cluster of neighborhoods on the   border have received the most pot summonses in the Big Apple for nine of the past 10 years, NYPD records show. And it’s thanks largely to Lt. Michael Lauterborn  —   the boss of the narcotics and   teams for the last nine years at the 105th Precinct  —   who’s been offering incentives to ticket   and other    scofflaws, sources told The Post. It’s clearly working. Cops in the 105th Precinct  —   which covers parts of Queens Village, Cambria Heights, Laurelton, Rosedale, and Springfield Gardens  —   wrote 1, 851 tickets for pot possession last year, the most among the city’s 77 precincts and a hefty 9 percent of the citywide total. “They force these guys to go out and write summonses  —   that’s how they get their Saturdays off and get easy overtime handed their way,” said one source. A detective who once worked under Lauterborn called him “smart and dedicated” and praised his methods. “He expected us to be aggressive in enforcing the law, especially around the trouble spots, resulting in crime suppression or   …     capturing those perps who were problematic for the community,” he said. “And he wanted us to use whatever enforcement tools we had to do so. ” The   ticket blitz has sparked a fiery debate, with residents saying they’re being unfairly targeted, and cops insisting they’re simply maintaining the quality of life in the sprawling precinct. “They’re coming out here looking for kids who smoke. They’re trying to fill quotas,” said Dion, 17, who griped that cops hunt for offenders outside Springfield Gardens H. S. complex. And it’s not hard for cops to sniff out the weedheads. “Some people just blatantly do it. They park, smoke, and blast music, they feel it’s eventually going to be legal,” said Laton Campbell, 20. The stack of summonses is growing, with 70 percent more pot tickets in the 105th last year compared to 2015, records show. One out of every four summonses in the Southeast Queens precinct is for marijuana possession. The 105th recorded 64 percent more tickets than the No. 2   precinct, the 75th in East New York, Brooklyn.   summonses surged 55 percent while weed arrests fell 31 percent citywide over the past two years, according to NYPD and state criminal justice records. The city changed its pot enforcement policy in November 2014, so that violators caught carrying less than 25 grams of pot receive a ticket rather than handcuffs. Violators face a $100 to $250 fine and a court appearance instead of an arrest. The 105th recorded 64 percent more tickets than the No. 2   precinct John Jay College Professor Peter Moskos, a former cop, said cops target pot and other    violations to prevent larger crimes. “It’s about the proactive policing that discovers marijuana and it’s about curbing other behavior,” he said. “It’s about   …     keeping people in line, and summonses are a tool they use. ” But Councilman Donovan Richards said quality of life is smoke and mirrors, accusing the precinct of having a ticket “quota system. ” “Until that is fixed we will continue to see these kinds of [summons] numbers,” he said. “I refuse to believe that Southeast Queens has more marijuana smokers than anywhere else in the city. ” Police spokesman Peter Donald said the department is “not focused on enforcement for its own sake. ” “We utilize the most precise tools available to reduce crime and respond to residents’ quality of life concerns where they exist,” he said. “This precision in 2016 led to fewer arrests, fewer summonses, and the safest year in New York City history. ”",1.0
"Legal Sea Foods boss’s ‘cold fish’ Clinton ad draws outrage. The boss of Legal Sea Foods has raised a stink for referring to Hillary Clinton as “cold fish” in a provocative ad. “We have a term for cold fish,” reads the caption under a portrait of smirking Clinton in the ad. “Sushi. ” Along the bottom of the    ad is a photo of the chain’s CEO, Roger Berkowitz, the words “Berkowitz for President” and #feeltheberk  —   a riff on Bernie Sanders’ “Feel the Bern” slogan. Legal Sea Foods ran the   ad in Monday’s edition of The Boston Globe. Berkowitz blew off the carping as a load of pollocks. “Our ads tend to be a little bit provocative to begin with,”  “This one was kind of interesting, because the blowback  —   in terms of people saying there was misogyny, there was racism, there was sexism  —   it was such a bizarre,   reaction. ” “Cold fish” usually means an emotionless person  —   but also can be used to describe an unresponsive sexual partner. Legal Sea Foods, whose ad about Berkowitz’s fictional run for president was developed by New   ad agency   has raised hackles before. In 2008, it offered a mocking mea culpa for ads comparing the appearance of Boston’s transit system to halibut, the Boston Globe reported. Three years later, the chain poked fun at conservationists and wildlife activists, the paper reported. “Save the crab,” began one spot. “Save it to show that every creature is sacred, no matter how small. Or, just save it so we can chop it up into tasty little crab cakes. ” And this year, it was assailed for its ads targeting Mexicans (“If we build a wall on the border, who will eat our delicious fish tacos? ”) and the LGBT community (“I support the gay community. That’s why we serve rainbow trout. ”). Most recently, Legal Sea Foods ran an ad before the Republican National Convention mocking Donald Trump and former candidate Marco Rubio’s comments about the candidate’s “small hands. ” “I can assure you, it’s not the size of your hands that are important,” the caption read. “But rather, the size of your shrimp. ” Berkowitz told Fox News that Clinton is not known for being particularly warm, but he wanted to cut bait with the sexism controversy. “If you go online and look at the definition of cold fish, more often than not it’s used on men,” Berkowitz told the Globe. “I think it’s  . ”",1.0
"Under Armour stock tumbles after tepid forecast. The shares of three large sneaker makers got shredded on Tuesday. Nike, Adidas and Under Armour saw their values sliced by about $3. 6 billion after investors got spooked when Under Armour forecast slower growth into 2017 and 2018.   Under Armour, the upstart among the trio, which had posted 12 straight quarters of 25   revenue growth, said Tuesday that sales in the third quarter rose 22. 2 percent. Plus, the company forecast that revenue in 2017 and 2018 would grow in the   percent range, testing Chairman and Chief Executive Kevin Plank’s pitch to Wall Street that Under Armour is a growth stock. With the air coming out of its sales gains, investors punished the stock, sending it down 13 percent, to $32. 89. Nike, which last month reported that futures orders failed to meet expectations, got caught in the downdraft, falling 1. 6 percent, to $51. 05. The ADRs of Germany’s Adidas slipped 1. 4 percent, to $83. 31. For Under Armour, the decline is its worst in more than seven years. “The growth is still there, and it requires significant investment,” Plank said on a call with investors. “It is time for us to invest. ” In the third quarter, profits at Under Armour, whose marquee endorser Stephen Curry began his   season with the Golden State Warriors Tuesday night, rose 27 percent to $128. 2 million, or 29 cents a share. Analysts had projected 25 cents. Revenue climbed to $1. 47 billion in the period as sales of Curry’s signature shoe helped produce a total just barely ahead of estimates of $1. 45 billion. But it was not enough for Under Armour to overcome the deflating feeling caused by its weak forecast over the next two years.",1.0

"Trump's Chief Strategist Steve Bannon Ran a Massive Climate Experiment. Before Steve Bannon was Donald Trump’s campaign advisor, a right-wing media mogul, or a conservative Hollywood documentarian, he helped a group of climate scientists steer a controversial experiment in the Arizona desert back from financial chaos. Twenty-five years ago, a New Agey-experiment called Biosphere 2 set out to recreate life on another planet with eight people locked in a giant glass habitat. But it ended bitterly with allegations of financial fraud, scientific goof-ups, and a power struggle outside the dome. Now some of the scientists who worked on Biosphere 2 hope that Bannon—who has been dogged by allegations of ties to the white nationalist alt-right movement—might steer Trump back from the edge of climate denial, and perhaps forge a better deal between the US and other nations intent on reducing heat-trapping greenhouses gases. That might seem far-fetched for someone whose website, Breitbart News, calls climate change a hoax and those who study it corrupt. But these scientists point to Bannon’s time as a successful turn-around manager of Biosphere 2 in the mid-1990s as proof that he understands climate science—and may not be as much of a climate denial zealot as the folks who write for his website.

"Israel intensifies battle with U.S. over U.N. resolution on settlements.   The Israeli government stepped up its running battle with the Obama administration on Tuesday, saying it had proof that the United States had orchestrated a U. N. Security Council resolution condemning settlement activity. “We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage,”  David Keyes, a spokesman for  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters. “We’re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night. ” State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied that the administration had “precooked” the resolution. But the U. S. explanation did little to quell fears in Israel that another Security Council censure may be forthcoming, even though U. S. officials insisted that no more U. N. resolutions are expected. Toner said the United States had abstained, allowing passage of the resolution, because it was “balanced”  —   it also condemns Palestinian incitement to violence and terrorism  —   and because there was growing concern that increased settlement activity was imperiling a   solution. “This was a resolution that we could not in good conscience veto, because it condemns violence. It condemned incitement,” Toner said. “It reiterates what has long been the overwhelming consensus internationally [on settlements] and it calls for the parties to take constructive steps to advance a   solution on the ground. There was nothing in there that would prompt us to veto that kind of resolution. ”      (Reuters)    The Israeli allegation of U. S. collusion in the resolution appears to be linked to meetings Secretary of State John F. Kerry had in recent months with Palestinian and Egyptian diplomats and officials from resolution   New Zealand, where Kerry stopped last month en route to Antarctica. State Department officials said no specific language was discussed. “There is no truth to the notion that we discussed the text of any resolution or that we previewed any position we might take on a hypothetical resolution in those meetings,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to comment on the private meetings. Amid acrid bitterness in Israel over what is seen as the United States’ failure to protect Israel in not using its veto, Kerry is returning to Washington from vacation to give a speech Wednesday  morning outlining his vision for resolving the conflict between the  Israelis and Palestinians.  There will be an     undertone to his remarks. With less than a month left before President Obama leaves office,   Donald Trump has vowed that the U. S.  relationship will be markedly different.  But there appeared to be little chance that the Israeli government would heed the “  call” Toner said he hoped the U. N. resolution would sound for Israel and curtail settlement activity. Israeli officials pressed ahead, preparing to approve construction permits Wednesday to build 600 new homes in East Jerusalem, which came under Israeli control after the 1967 war. Since Friday’s vote, Netanyahu has summoned diplomats from countries that voted for the resolution and recalled Israel’s ambassadors in New Zealand and Senegal, two of the four countries that sponsored the resolution. Some   members of Netanyahu’s coalition have called on him to ramp up settlement construction and have said Israel should annex parts of the West Bank. Meanwhile, new details started to emerge about the    diplomatic scramble that preceded the resolution  —    approved by a vote of 14 to 0  —   declaring that Israel’s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have “no legal validity” and are a “flagrant violation under international law. ” It calls the settlements an obstacle to achieving a   solution and peace with the Palestinians. A diplomat from a Security Council nation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, largely backed up the Obama administration’s account that it played no role in bringing the resolution to a vote. It had been discussed among Security Council members for months, but the U. S. position was well known. The United States never told anyone how it would vote, not even in a consultation room where the 15 members of the Security Council gathered before they filed in to vote, according to the diplomat. The U. S. officials in attendance said they were still in “consultations” over the resolution, the diplomat said. In Israel, the newspaper Haaretz reported that Britain, not the United States, appears to have been the driving force behind the resolution after Egypt, which had initially sponsored the resolution, withdrew. It described Netanyahu being sharp and caustic in a phone call to New Zealand’s foreign minister, Murray McCully, calling the resolution “a declaration of war. ” Haaretz said that Netanyahu vowed to recall Israel’s ambassador to New Zealand but that McCully rebuffed the threat. The report said that after Egypt backed down, Palestinian and Arab Persian Gulf diplomats urged the four   nations to move on with the resolution anyway. The message was driven home by Britain, which had worked directly with the Palestinians on drafting the language. A   glitch came up when Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, proposed postponing the vote until after Christmas, according to an interview the deputy Russian ambassador to Israel gave on Israel Army Radio. This reportedly followed a phone call between Netanyahu and Russian President Vladi mir Putin. The other Security Council ambassadors refused to wait, however.       Eglash reported from Jerusalem.

"Cognitive science suggests Trump makes us more accepting of the morally outrageous.  In October 2015, a college student named Lauren Batchelder stood up at a campaign forum in Manchester, New Hampshire, and challenged Donald Trump’s record on women’s issues. “Maybe I’m wrong,” she said, “maybe you can prove me wrong, but I don’t think you’re a friend to women. ”    So far, this might sound like a perfectly ordinary case of campaign confrontation, but things soon took a more surprising turn. Trump attacked Batchelder personally on Twitter, describing her as ”nasty” and an ”arrogant young woman,” and even suggesting she was secretly working for Jeb Bush’s campaign. (She wasn’t.) Soon, Batchelder was receiving online rape threats from Trump supporters. Five days before the election, she got a Facebook message from someone threatening to ”stomp your head on the curb and urinate in your bloodied mouth. ” Incidents like this one have provoked a distinctive form of condemnation. Commentators have not simply described Trump’s behavior as bad or wrong; they have insisted it is not normal. More strikingly, they have suggested it is deeply important that such behavior not be “normalized. ” The suggestion seems to be that there is something of value, something worth fighting to preserve, in our shared understanding that certain conduct is not a normal part of the way American politics works. But what does that mean, exactly? Why is it so very important to hold on to our understanding that these sorts of things are abnormal? What would be lost if we stopped seeing them as abnormal and started seeing them, instead, as simply “bad” or “wrong”?     To get a better understanding of these issues, we can turn to research in cognitive science. Recent studies have taught us a lot about what happens when people classify events as normal or abnormal. The findings have real potential to help us understand what would actually occur if behavior like Trump’s were to be gradually normalized.    Our minds use the   distinction to rule out many options in advance At the core of this research is a very simple idea: When people are reasoning, they tend to think only about a relatively narrow range of possibilities. You are sitting there in a restaurant, trying to decide what to order. Almost immediately, you determine that you are going to get either the chocolate cake or the cheese plate. You then start to consider the merits and drawbacks of each option. ”Should I get the chocolate cake? Nah, too many carbs. Better get the cheese plate.” One important question about human cognition is how people end up choosing one option over the other in a case like this. But there is another question here that is even more fundamental  —   so fundamental that it’s easy to overlook. How did you pick out those two options in the first place? After all, there’s an enormous range of other options that would, at least in principle, have been possible. You could have stormed into the kitchen and started eating directly out of the chef’s saucepan. You could have reached under the table and started trying to eat your own shoe. Yet somehow you manage to reject all of these possibilities before the reasoning process even begins. It’s not as though you think, ”Should I try to eat my shoe? No, it’s not very tasty, or even edible.” Rather, possibilities like this one never even enter your reasoning at all.    This is where the notion of normality plays its most essential role. Of all the zillions of things that might be possible in principle, your mind is able to zero in on just a few specific possibilities, completely ignoring all the others. One aim of recent research has been to figure out how people do this. Though the research itself has been quite complex, the key conclusion is surprisingly straightforward: People show an impressive systematic tendency to completely ignore the possibilities they see as abnormal. We make use of the   distinction when thinking about causality Although researchers have developed numerous methods for studying the way people think about possibilities, one of the most popular is just to look in detail at the way they use the word “cause. ” This sort of research might at first seem a bit far removed from any question of real importance, but it actually serves as a valuable indirect method for figuring out which possibilities people consider and which they ignore. People consider the range of causes for an occurrence much as they weigh the dining options at a restaurant: with a   selectivity. For example, suppose a person lights a match and carelessly drops it on the ground, and a forest fire begins. Now take the sentence, “The lit match caused the forest fire. ” If you are like most people, you will think this sentence sounds about right (even if it doesn’t tell the whole story).     Of course, the sentence does not itself mention any alternative possibilities, but most researchers think it gives us an important clue about which possibilities people are considering. In particular, it suggests that people are thinking something along the lines of: If the person hadn’t carelessly dropped the lit match, the forest fire would not have occurred.  Okay, now consider a different case. Start with the same story. Person drops match, forest fire starts. But this time, take a different sentence: “The presence of oxygen in the atmosphere caused the fire. ” If you are like most people, you will think this sentence sounds very wrong. But why? On some level, the two cases are completely parallel. After all, you would surely agree on reflection that If there hadn’t been any oxygen in the atmosphere, the forest fire would not have occurred.  Yet there is a deeper respect in which this second case is completely different. The difference is that most people would never consider possibilities in which there is literally no oxygen in the atmosphere. These possibilities seem outlandish, preposterous, not even worth entertaining. In short, just by looking at the fact that people agree with certain sentences, we can get valuable clues about which possibilities they are considering. There have now been a whole slew of different studies using this method, and although some controversy remains about how to interpret the results, the overall pattern seems to be pointing toward an important and very general conclusion: People appear to have a systematic tendency to focus on the possibilities they see as normal and to ignore the ones they see as abnormal.  So, for example, a situation in which there is no oxygen in the atmosphere is seen as “abnormal,” and for the sake of cognitive efficiency, the mind gives it zero consideration. (My   Thomas Icard and Jonathan Kominsky, and I review some of the experimental evidence for this claim in a recent technical paper.) Once an option is recategorized as “normal,” people are more likely to choose it There is a corollary to this finding: If people’s ideas about what is normal and abnormal change, that can cause changes in the possibilities they consider  —   and even the actions they take.    For an especially striking example, consider a   problem that arose in Arizona’s Petrified Forest National Park. Tourists were stealing bark from the trees, and the park as a whole was gradually being destroyed. What could be done to stop this theft? The staff of the park decided in the end to put up a sign: ‘‘Your heritage is being vandalized every day by theft losses of petrified wood of 14 tons a year, mostly a small piece at a time. ’’ The goal was to raise awareness of the problem, making people see more clearly what was so bad about stealing from the park.  Perhaps the sign did succeed in raising awareness, but it also had another, more surprising effect. By drawing attention to the fact that people often steal, it made people see theft as normal. Many of the park visitors might have seen theft as something that wasn’t even worth considering (like trying to eat your shoe) but the sign helped to switch them over to seeing it as something that might be bad but was still among the normal options (like eating chocolate cake). A systematic study examined the impact of this sign. The key result: Putting up this sign actually led to an increase in the total amount of theft.  Trump’s rhetoric may be shifting the boundaries of what the American polity will consider This framework now makes it possible to understand the difference between seeing Trump’s behavior as bad and seeing it as abnormal. When we see something as bad, we feel there are specific reasons not to move forward with it. This is the attitude that liberals typically take toward tax cuts. They think people should think critically about fiscal policy, see what is bad or wrong about tax cuts, and then fight to resist them.  But this does not seem to be an appropriate response to the sorts of things Trump has been doing. When a candidate faces a challenge from a college student, we do not want the candidate to be thinking: ”Should I start tweeting out insults about her? No, that would be bad because. ..” On the contrary, if we get to the point where candidates are thinking about whether behavior like this would be good or bad, things have already gone too far. This is the sort of possibility that should be ruled out before the process of considering different options has even begun.  And it’s not just a matter of a few inappropriate tweets.   policies, such as new laws to constrain the press, or a federal registry of Muslims, are now being placed in the category of the “thinkable. ” Of course, many people still believe these policies are deeply wrong, but all the same, it can hardly be denied that people are considering them. These are policies that would at one time have been regarded as completely outside the sphere of possibility. It has become something of a cliché to blame the media for these developments. The usual suggestion is that if only the press had been more strident in its condemnation, Trump’s behavior could never have been fully “normalized. ” This cliché gets everything wrong. The sign in the park included a vigorous denunciation of theft, but it nonetheless served to normalize the very behavior it was denouncing. Likewise, no matter how frequently and loudly we insist that what Trump is doing is wrong, we normalize his behavior just by letting people know about it.    The park found a simple solution to its problem. It removed the sign and thereby stopped informing people about the prevalence of theft. The trouble is that there is no hope at all of adopting an analogous solution in the case of Trump’s behavior. Trump is our   and there is no real way we can refrain from informing people about the things he does. Whatever else we might decide to do, we can’t just agree to stop talking about him.  So then, what is to be done? I wish I could say that cognitive scientists have settled on a different but equally effective solution and that all we need to do now is go out and implement it. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case. Research in cognitive science has done a lot to give us a deeper understanding of the problem we now face, but it has not yet furnished us with a workable way of addressing it.

"How to Reduce Gun Violence: Ask Some Scientists. President Trump doesn’t often ask scientists for help, but on Monday he seemed to be breaking from tradition. In a speech Monday about the deadly mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso last week, the president pitched a couple ideas for policies that might reduce the horrifying ubiquity of violent men with guns in public places. The president and other national leaders might take both literally and seriously the spontaneous chant that erupted from the crowd when Ohio governor Mike DeWine appeared at a vigil for the dead in Dayton: Do something. This is where the science should come in. A straight-up restriction on gun ownership would work, yes, but that’s politically—constitutionally—untenable, at least as the current Supreme Court would have it. But other, more subtle options and interventions are out there. Work on reducing deaths in car crashes doesn’t demand banning all cars; requiring seat belts made a huge difference. So what’s the gun policy equivalent of a seat belt? To answer that, you need data, hypotheses, experiments. And that’s a problem. Many basic statistics about gun violence stubbornly fail to exist. The science of how many, how often, and how bad hasn’t been done. The studies of what causes people to become violent and use firearms, of who those people are, of how to find them and stop them—they haven’t been done. The deeper problem here is that in 1996 Congress made it illegal to put federal money toward gun control and cut the gun violence research budget at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Republicans argued that such research was actually political, and designed to restrict gun ownership. (The rule is called the Dickey Amendment, and it was the result of lobbying by the National Rifle Association.) In 2018 Congress lifted the de facto ban, but didn’t fund any research. Other sources of funding exist, but research in gun violence consistently gets less money and attention than any comparable cause of death. That was mostly intentional; if you censor the explanations, then violence becomes inexplicable—senseless, or “evil.” Politicians can shake their heads and deploy thoughts and prayers instead of policy. In some ways the science of gun violence hasn’t really advanced since the Macarena was at the top of the charts. One thing it’d be good to know: How bad is the problem? In his Monday speech, the president went on to say that since the mass murder at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, “one mass shooting has followed another, over and over again, decade after decade.” Yet even that simple matter of fact—whether they’ve become more frequent—is the source of debate. At least one researcher says the overall rate has been steady for decades, as the president claims; other public health researchers assert that the pace tripled in 2011, and that the first guy was overcounting by including targeted, multiple-victim homicides alongside the more randomized, mass-shooting horrors like Gilroy’s Garlic Festival or the El Paso-Juarez Walmart. The CDC doesn’t collect data on gun deaths in a way that’d make it easy to answer this question. When the president says—as he did on Monday—“we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” the lack of research again dooms his ambition to failure. “We must reform our mental health laws,” the president said, and “we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms.” But nobody’s completely sure what those warning signs are, except in broad strokes. The president has a hypothesis. “We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly videogames that are now commonplace,” the president said. This is an old trope. Jeff Sessions, President Trump’s first attorney general, was a US senator from Alabama at the time of the Columbine massacre, which he blamed on “liberalism,” “relativism,” internet chat rooms, violent videogames, and the movie Natural Born Killers. Comparative evidence suggests that’s a red herring—lots of countries have violent videogames; only the United States has three mass casualty shootings in one week. Research on violent videogames often suggests that frequent players show increased aggression (though at least one major study did not). But that doesn’t necessarily connect to violent or criminal behavior. The studies haven’t been done. And meanwhile the questions have stacked up. In 2013 the Institute of Medicine set out a research agenda to figure out why people buy guns, and what subpopulations own them. The institute asked about the risks of having guns in homes, and of minors having access to them, as well as whether some locations were at higher risk than others of gun violence … along with what policies or technologies could make guns safer. Oh, and the IOM suggested studying videogames and other violent media influences. In 2017, a committee of emergency medicine physicians set out their own firearms research agenda. It’s extensive, so I won’t list every question, but the known unknowns include: How is gun violence prevention different from other kinds of violence prevention? What kind of data reporting would help? What is the epidemiology of firearm suicide? Does social media make assault with guns worse? Do certain locations attract gun violence, like bars, or parks? What are the signs in someone about to commit mass gun violence? What kinds of security and infrastructure prevent a mass shooting? What kinds of characteristics, like buying guns or high-capacity magazines, correlate with mass shootings? These seem like good things to know. In 2018, an editorial in the International Journal of Epidemiology proposed that epidemiologists, too, could play an important role in reducing gun violence in the US, if they could simply get at the data. After all, the authors pointed out, just owning a gun is strongly associated with injury and death by firearm—suicide, homicide, and accident. The US, the editorial goes on to say, had the highest number of firearm homicides of any wealthy nation in 2015—ten times the number of the next four countries on the list combined. Why? Dunno. No data. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the 1996 Macarena-freeze didn’t put an end to gun violence work completely. It continued. And it learned a few things. Just as when the scientific community took on automotive deaths or sepsis in hospitals or any number of other preventable public health problems, science has already come up with some answers. So as the public policy researcher Philip Cook says in a 2018 review of firearms control policy and history in the journal Criminology and Public Policy, it is indeed possible to know facts about guns and how to reduce their violent use. For one thing: Guns are more deadly than other weapons. “Duh,” you are thinking, but consider why that’s important. In crimes of passion, or inebriation, the choice of weapon is secondary to intent. If someone impulsively determines to commit violence, the relative deadliness of their weapon of convenience matters—to the outcome and to the legal response. So it makes sense to try to reduce gun access in general. For two: The same goes for assault and suicide. If people have access to guns, they’re more likely to use them when they attempt to harm others or themselves. One survey of inmates in state prisons who’d used guns in their crimes asked where they’d gotten them; barely one in 10 had bought their own. The rest had begged, borrowed, or stolen them. If they hadn’t been able to get a gun, they wouldn’t have used it in the crime. And here’s a really cool part. Three specific policies, when implemented in states, reduced gun homicide rates. Simple moves here showed marked decreases: Restricting the right to carry a concealed weapon, implementing waiting periods on the purchase of firearms (a “cooling-off period”), and denying gun ownership to people convicted of domestic violence. People who are violent to partners or family members often go on to be violent to strangers. In fact, a domestic-violence ban and background checks that take mental health into account have seen bipartisan support in the past, even in the face of NRA lobbying. And they might again. After the horror of last week’s multiple shootings, Republican leadership led by Senator Mitch McConnell has claimed to be ready to look at some of these options—perhaps in the form of so-called red flag laws. What’s important here, though, is that this presidential administration has consistently treated science and data as a nuisance, as something to ignore or mischaracterize in pursuit of policies that serve corporate or cultural interests. It’s an approach with murderous outcomes. As is the case with climate change, with vaccines, and—despite Texas Senator John Cornyn’s tweet to the contrary—homelessness and gun violence, scientists have been presenting policymakers with viable solutions for years. But the problem hasn’t budged. It’s big. It’s squishy. It’s political. And no, scientists don’t have all the answers. But they have some. Maybe now, maybe this time, people in power will finally, excuse the expression, pull the trigger.",0.0
"Too many supplements contain hidden and illegal drugs. Weight loss pills are the worst offenders..  Dietary supplements are barely regulated in the United States. The makers of these pills  —   which are commonly sold at pharmacies, natural health stores, and gyms  —   don’t need to prove their products are safe or even effective before putting them on store shelves.    It was that fact that prompted Soo Oh and me to comb through government databases, court documents, and scientific studies to find out what dubious ingredients have been found to lurk in popular supplements.           Click here to search for your favorite supplement We uncovered more than 850 products that have contained illegal   hidden ingredients  —   including banned drugs, pharmaceuticals like antidepressants, and other synthetic chemicals that have never been tested on humans. Weight loss supplements are the most likely to have problems One striking revelation: More than half of the offending supplements that have been found to contain illegal or hidden ingredients were marketed for weight loss (431 in all). The second most popular category was sexual enhancement supplements, followed by muscle builders. Some weight loss supplements contained appetite suppressants like sibutramine. The government removed sibutramine from the market in 2010 for safety reasons: It can increase blood pressure and pulse rate, causing coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and even death.    Other weight loss pills contained antidepressants like Prozac, or hidden laxatives, including the drug phenolphthalein. Phenolphthalein was banned by the FDA after it was found to increase the risk of irregular heartbeat and cause cancer with   use. Some products, such as Slim Xtreme, actually contained both phenolphthalein and sibutramine. Note: This supplement was marketed as ”100% natural.” You can search our database for your favorite supplement and learn more about supplement regulation here.

"The Air Force's New Rescue Chopper Flies Farther Than Ever. Compared to many a warbird, the US Air Force’s newest helicopter seems positively peaceful. It carries no Hydra rockets or Hellfire missiles, just a pair of .50-caliber machine guns—you can’t float about totally unarmed, after all. That’s because this chopper prioritizes saving lives over taking them. Sikorsky’s HH-60W is a flying ambulance, a medical evacuation aircraft designed to dip into combat zones, pick up the injured, and whisk them to safety. Instead of using precious lifting capability for missiles and rockets, it hauls extra fuel, configurable stretchers, and a hoist to pluck wounded fighting men and women out of areas the chopper can’t land in. The new Combat Rescue Helicopter, as the Air Force dubbed it, comes with a suite of improvements over the HH-60 Pave Hawk it’s replacing, some of them long needed. It will be able to fly farther and protect itself better. It contains new mission-planning hardware that allows crews to better coordinate their efforts and more efficiently search for injured comrades. Its mission-planning hardware provides multifunction displays not just for the pilots but for the crews in back, who help coordinate and execute rescue missions. “A lot of times the flight engineer in the back wants to know altitude, airspeed, direction, and other data, or look at the infrared displays, but requesting that information from the pilots takes precious seconds away from their ability to safely fly,” says program director Greg Hames. Now, the folks in back can take on some of that workload. The crew in the rear also get newly configured seats that swivel to face either those multifunction displays, inside toward patients on stretchers, or outside to fire the window-mounted machine guns. The seats can also be collapsed and stowed up at the ceiling in seconds, to create more room. Stretchers can be stacked and configured to carry more or otherwise optimize their position for the rescue crews working on the patients. A typical crew would include two pilots up front, a flight engineer and a paramedic in back, and room for several litters. The Air Force found deficiencies in the aircraft last year, but Sikorsky says it has solved the problems. The HH-60W has roughly twice the fuel capacity as its predecessor, thanks to a new tank positioned behind the cabin that replaces the Pave Hawk’s bulky auxiliary tanks, which took up interior space. That will double flight time from about two and a half hours to five, without impacting the helicopter’s balance. The extra range means it can fly into combat zones the Pave Hawks can’t reach, an important factor in light of how combat is potentially shifting from the guerrilla tactics of Afghanistan and Iraq to more modernized forces in Iran and Syria, as detailed by Breaking Defense. The new helicopter also comes equipped with a Tactical Mission Kit that includes more advanced detection and defensive systems; hardening against cyberattack; improved connectivity with other networks, vehicles, and troops in the area; new optical and infrared cameras; and missile- and rocket-detection capabilities. It has improved weapon mounts, ammunition storage, and armor plating. New seats should better withstand ground impacts. The Combat Rescue Helicopter made its first flight in May, after starting development in 2012. The Air Force awarded Sikorsky and parent company Lockheed Martin a $1.3 billion contract to develop the aircraft. At the moment, two models are undergoing flight tests in West Palm Beach. Although the Air Force last year found multiple deficiencies in the aircraft’s systems, and Sikorsky has fallen behind on development by several months, the company says it it has solved the problems and expects to meet a September deadline that should allow it to begin production. The helicopter could enter service as soon as next year, and the Air Force expects to order 112 in total by 2029. Still, the rapid evolution of opposition to the American military means that even as the new chopper swings into action, new challenges will arise. According to a report in Aviation Week, Air Force and industry engineers worry that even with reduced vulnerability, no conventional helicopter will be able to ensure success in battlefield rescues in the face of new enemy tactics and more advanced weaponry. As a result, the Air Force is contemplating augmenting the HH-60W with electric air vehicles that can be dropped in seconds with a paramedic on board, and then autonomously fly both patient and paramedic out of immediate danger. That’s still a long way off, but any service members stranded in danger before then can still count on an improved chance of rescue, thanks to this new spin doctor.",0.0
"Hillary Clinton is proposing a policy to tackle deep poverty.  On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton unveiled what is arguably among the most important policies she’s announced during her entire presidential campaign. It is an ambitious but politically attainable plan that will lift huge numbers of families with children out of poverty. It is targeted exclusively at the poor, and the extreme poor in particular, with no money spent on the middle class or rich.    Specifically, Clinton is calling for a change in the refundability threshold of the child tax credit. That sounds like a technical change, but it has tremendous ramifications. Currently, the poorest American families can’t claim the credit, which is a mainstay of the tax returns of most   families. That’s because households that make less than $3, 000 a year  —   the truly, desperately poor  —   are excluded entirely, and households making under $9, 666. 67 can’t get the full credit. Clinton would change the law so that families start getting the credit with the first dollar they earn. That would effectively increase the tax refunds of the poorest families with children. In addition, Clinton would double the credit for children 4 and under, something that helps both poor and   families with young kids, and she’d make the credit phase in much faster for families with kids in that age range. An analysis by Chuck Marr and Chloe Cho of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that Clinton’s plan will lift 1. 5 million people above the poverty line, and bring another 9. 4 million closer to the poverty line. It would increase the incomes of 5. 2 million people living in deep poverty.    The plan is not a complete answer to the increase in extreme poverty that’s occurred over the past two decades, but it’s a very good start. And it takes the US closer to the system most other rich countries use of simply giving every family a child allowance of a few thousand dollars per kid every year, no strings attached.    How the child tax credit works  —   and how Clinton would improve it             To understand why what Clinton’s proposing is a big deal, you need to know a bit about how the child tax credit works. Originally, the credit didn’t fight poverty at all. It was first enacted in 1997, as a $500 nonrefundable credit. That meant that only families with a positive income tax burden (which almost always excludes poor families, who don’t earn enough to pay income taxes) benefited. The Bush tax cuts of 2001 doubled the credit to $1, 000, where it remains today, and made it refundable for the first time  —   but only partly. The refundable part phased in for families that earned at least $10, 000 a year. For each dollar they earned above that, they could get 15 cents of the credit, up to a max of $1, 000. That let poor families benefit from the credit for the first time, but very poor families were still shut out.    The Obama stimulus package of 2009 lowered the $10, 000 threshold to $3, 000, and didn’t index it to inflation. That greatly expanded the number of poor families eligible for the credit. This was initially a temporary measure, but in 2015 the administration succeeded in making the measure permanent as part of a tax deal with congressional Republicans. That’s great news. But one thing we’ve learned in recent years is that the 1996 welfare reform substantially increased the number of people living in desperate poverty. The University of Michigan’s Luke Shaefer and Johns Hopkins’ Kathryn Edin have found that the share of families living on less than $2 per day in cash income per person more than doubled from 1996 to 2011. That suggests that more and more families are living on less than $3, 000 a year in taxable earnings, and are thus excluded from the child tax credit. The simplest way to fix this would be to simply make the tax credit fully refundable: Everyone below the phaseout level ($75, 000 for singles, $110, 000 for married couples) just gets a check for $1, 000 in the mail every year for each kid they have (or $83. 33 every month, etc. ). Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( ) has proposed something along these lines: a fully refundable $1, 500 credit for kids under 3, with no  .    The problem with this idea is mostly political. So long as there’s an earnings   backers of the child tax credit can say it only goes to people who work. You need earnings to get it. It isn’t welfare. That’s a potent argument, and one that’s helped sustain and expand both the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit over the years. So Clinton and other policymakers looking to expand the child credit, like Sen. Michael Bennet ( ) have tended to instead move the   threshold to $0, and increase the   for families with young kids. Both Clinton and Bennet would increase the   from 15 percent to 45 percent for families with young children, meaning the poorest families are considerably likelier to get the full credit. And because Clinton is also proposing doubling the credit for young kids, the full credit will be twice as valuable to boot. It’s not clear how expensive the whole plan is. Last year, the Tax Policy Center’s Elaine Maag estimated that reducing the refundability threshold to $0 would cost about $16. 5 billion more over 10 years than merely keeping it at $3, 000. That’s a relative pittance for a policy that, in Maag’s words, ”would target additional CTC benefits on very low income families: just over   of families with children in the lowest income quintile and about a quarter of those in the second quintile would receive larger credits.” Back in 2011, the Tax Policy Center estimated the average tax break that poor people affected by the change would get to be $372 a year  —   not a lot to   families, but a very significant sum for families in desperate poverty. What it means that Hillary Clinton is announcing this             This is a somewhat odd policy for Clinton to be touting in the last month of the presidential election. It does help families with young children, which includes a lot of voters she’s courting, but changing the refundability threshold and the   rate are only changes that help people who are much poorer than the average American family. To see a benefit from these changes, your household income has to be less than $10, 000 a year. That’s not a closing argument to win a general election. But it is an effort to address one of the ideological left’s main criticisms of Hillary Clinton’s policy legacy, and an important signpost to congressional Democrats about the possible direction of a governing agenda.    While Bernie Sanders did not make it a signature issue himself, Hillary Clinton’s support of the 1996 welfare reforms became a major point of controversy among     writers and intellectuals backing Sanders during the primary debate. It was the clearest case they could make that Clinton was willing to gut the safety net, to participate in a disastrous reform effort that resulted, according to multiple studies, in a rise in extreme poverty. She backed a policy that is literally making children go hungry. Clinton, who worked for the Children’s Defense Fund early in her career and was the driving force behind the Children’s Health Insurance Program, naturally does not think of herself as someone willing to let children starve in the streets. Nor do her staffers, many of whom are veterans of Clinton and Obama administration fights to expand refundable tax credits. Crafting a policy specifically designed to give more money to people in extreme poverty is a compelling way to signal that this really is a matter she takes seriously, and that she understands something needs to be done to account for the failures of welfare reform. Just as importantly, the proposal functions as a statement of priorities to Democrats in Congress. Given Donald Trump’s ongoing implosion, and polls suggesting Clinton could win by   it looks at least conceivable that Clinton could take office with a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate. That is not really a situation anyone had planned for. The party has spent the past five years proposing policies  —   the Buffett rule, universal   etc.  —   that essentially functioned as cheap talk. They’re good campaign issues, but they were crafted with the assumption they’d never pass because of the   House. It’s not clear how moderate Democrats in   districts would vote in a scenario where the Democratic agenda of the past few years could actually become law. And it’s not clear which of these bills Democrats would want to go first. Clinton has been pretty consistent in signaling she wants to do immigration reform and infrastructure spending first. But both of those are issues that could probably be done with a Republican Congress, too. So she might want to   things that can pass with a Democratic Congress, operating under the assumption that she’d lose the House again in 2018, as occurs in most midterms. This proposal signals to House Democrats that expanding the child tax credit, and more generally doing tax breaks for poor and   families, is something Clinton wants to prioritize in that scenario. It’s hard to imagine this stuff passing with Paul Ryan still in office as House speaker. But if Nancy Pelosi gets the job, it becomes possible.  We know how to end poverty. So why don’t we?

"The Lego Batman Movie is a terrifically fun, playful addition to the Batman canon.  If a bunch of    who’d obsessively watched every Batman movie were equipped with a ridiculously excellent, eclectic Lego set, the result might be The Lego Batman Movie.     It’s everything you could want from a Batman movie and, in some respects, from any movie: goofy,   very funny, imaginative, and packing a sincere message that has both personal and political implications. There are explosions and parties and dinosaurs and chases. And it’s both nostalgic and contemporary  —   both Lego and Batman have entertained kids for generations  —   which means it’s a movie for pretty much everyone. But the best thing about Lego Batman is its explosive, unabashed joy  —   joy of the kind that’s rooted in both a great sense of humor and a sensibility I can only describe as “playing pretend. ” The same spirit of improvisation and recklessness that leads us to dump boxes of Lego bricks onto the carpet and then pair rocket ships with   sets is in full force here  —   and it’s even more fun when strung onto the spine of a Batman story.

The Lego Batman Movie takes a typical   path, but with a twist Our hero (voiced by Will Arnett)  —   who is, as you might recall, both costumed superhero Batman and ordinary superrich guy Bruce Wayne  —   appears on the scene as he’s saving Gotham (once again) from the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) and his henchmen, which includes everyone from the Riddler (Conan O’Brien) to Bane (Doug Benson). He succeeds, as he always does, but in the process he hurts Joker’s feelings: When the villain mocks Batman by remarking that their mutual antagonism is what keeps them both going, Batman negs him hard.     Because Batman? He doesn’t care about Joker. He doesn’t even think about Joker except when absolutely necessary. He doesn’t need anybody.             This, of course, drives Joker to new levels of supervillainy that involve emptying out not just Arkham Asylum, but also a shadowy   in the heavens known as the Phantom Zone. (The Zone is guarded by a simple   brick named Phyllis, voiced by Ellie Kemper.)     But before that, Batman returns home to Wayne Manor, alone on its island, where he lives with only his faithful butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) and his     computer ’Puter (which is credited to “Siri”) for company. He wanders around alone at night, looking at old family pictures  —   alone. He sits in his   home movie theater and watches Jerry Maguire and eats ice cream  —   alone. He microwaves and eats his lobster thermidor  —   alone. Batman (and Bruce Wayne, by default) works alone, lives alone, and, presumably, will die alone, if he has his way. Fate has other plans. Batman  —   excuse me, Bruce Wayne  —   puts on a tux and attends the retirement party of Commissioner Gordon (Hector Elizondo) where he also meets and is vaguely smitten with the new police commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson) his old friend’s daughter. Bruce’s steps are dogged by a   orphan named Dick (Michael Cera)  —   our future Robin, of course  —   who thinks Bruce Wayne is the coolest person on the planet next to Batman. Bruce accidentally adopts Dick (you’ll see) who moves into Wayne Manor and is there for a week before   Bruce notices. Then Joker  —   aided by faithful sidekick Harley Quinn (Jenny Slate) and all the usual suspects  —   stages an assault to end all assaults on Gotham. And it’s up to Batman, Barbara, Dick, and Alfred to save the city.             From there, of course, the narrative arc is rather conventionally set: It’s a Batman movie, Batman’s gonna Batman. But along the way, he learns a valuable lesson about going it alone, being overly   and the importance of a “village” for crime fighting. You can save Gotham much more effectively if you let people help you  —   and even more effectively if you acknowledge your archrival as your sworn frenemy.     The Lego Batman Movie suggests that relearning childhood joy of playing is good for adults, too Perhaps the most fun thing about The Lego Batman Movie is that it’s making a play to be part of the Batman canon. Alfred acknowledges Batman’s history by slyly referring (several times) to the history of Batman films and eras, through which he has patiently assisted. (Now he gets to be one of the heroes.) So we get throwbacks to the manic   Joel Schumacher age and the moody Dark Knight era, and costume references that go all the way back to the early days. That throwback to Batman’s history is certainly fan service, but it’s something else, too: a winking reference to the audience’s old loves. People will bring their children to this movie (and their children will love it) but it’s perfectly suited to   too  —   usually a marker of a great animated film. If you remember Batman all the way back to the 1940s, this movie remembers you.  That Lego first hit the market in 1949, six years after the first Batman serial and the same year as the Batman and Robin serial, can’t be totally coincidental. Both Batman and Lego have been with us for a long time, captivating kids’ (and adults’) imaginations and giving them free space to play and invent their own stories. Combining the two in Lego Batman doubles the nostalgic appeal, while also doubling the creativity. What kid hasn’t imagined himself as the Caped Crusader  —   and what kid hasn’t dumped that box of plastic bricks onto the living room carpet and seen what happened next?             But while Lego Batman takes a raucous romp through the Batman movies (and the comics and an assortment of other influences) it doesn’t exclude more recent influences, either. There are winking nods to Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The Phantom Zone houses not only villains both familiar and obscure from the DC Comics Universe, but also assorted other villains: Godzilla, King Kong, vampires, ghouls, Voldemort, the Eye of Sauron. There are vintage Lego villains calculated to delight every child of the 1980s, even those who aren’t particularly enamored of Batman himself. Indeed, the key to Lego Batman’s humor is its eagerness to manically pile on every reference it can come up with  —   this is a movie that will reward a rewatch  —   while staying true to the rules of its   universe. Namely: Batman must win, justice must prevail, and, ultimately, Lego blocks lock if you push them together.     Which is what makes it also a   movie for our divided times. It’s impossible to ignore The Lego Batman Movie’s gentle rebuke to those who would misguidedly save the world without the benefit of friends and wise companions. And that’s fine.  But along with its exhortation to embrace your friends and family  —   and maybe even your sworn enemies, since you never know when you might need them  —   when you’re out fighting crime, Lego Batman also nudges us to let loose and use our imaginations again. Maybe some intractable problems have solutions, if we can only regain our sense of play. The Lego Batman Movie releases in movie theaters on February 10. ",-1.0
"Trump called the press ‘the enemy.’ Reince Priebus says he meant it..          Blasting stories that cite anonymous sources, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that President Trump meant it when he condemned the media as the “enemy” of the people. “I think you should take it seriously,” Priebus said of Trump’s statement. “I think the problem we’ve got is that we’re talking about bogus stories.   …     And I think the media needs to, in some cases, not every case   …     but in some cases, really needs to get its act together. ” During an interview with CBS’s John Dickerson that aired Sunday, Priebus cited two recent stories that he described as “grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown” and “total garbage. ”   [Two explosive reports on Trump and Russia. Zero    sources.]   One is a New York Times report that says phone records and intercepted calls show Trump’s aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. CNN also has published a similar story. The other is a Wall Street Journal article about U. S. intelligence officials withholding sensitive information from the president because of fears that it could be leaked. The stories relied on revelations by current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose classified information. That’s a problem, Priebus said. “I think that we’ve gotten to a place, John, where the media is willing to run with unnamed sources, apparently false leaked documents,” the chief of staff said. “We deal with one after the next. I think the media should stop with this   stuff. Put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren’t willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn’t be listed, period. ” Over the past several weeks, media outlets, including The Washington Post, have published damning stories that portray an administration in disarray, some of which have resulted in investigations. Many, if not all, cited anonymous sources.   [‘That’s how dictators get started’: McCain criticizes Trump for calling media ‘the enemy’]   One example is a recent Post report that revealed that former national security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U. S. sanctions against Russia with the country’s ambassador before the inauguration and mischaracterized that conversation to Vice President Pence. Flynn resigned shortly after. Priebus defended Flynn on “Face the Nation. ” “There’s nothing wrong with having a conversation about sanctions, and there’s nothing wrong with having conversations about the fact that the Obama administration put further sanctions in place and expelled some folks out of the United States,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with that topic coming up in a conversation. ” Whether Flynn didn’t tell Pence the truth or whether he forgot the details of the conversation is “a totally separate issue,” Priebus said. Trump has used the reliance on unnamed sources to attack the credibility of news organizations, dismissing their stories as “fake news” and “conspiracy theories. ” In a tweet Friday, he called the media, specifically mentioning the New York Times, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN, “the enemy of the American People. ”   The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017     Don’t believe the main stream (fake news) media. The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017     The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017   Priebus echoed his boss’s criticisms, dismissing recent media stories as “stupidity” and reporting based on information that didn’t come from the heads of intelligence agencies. “And we’re sitting here talking about it,” he said. “And it’s a shame. And it needs to end. ” Dickerson then asked whether the administration’s strategy in dealing with backlash from explosive stories is simply to blame the media. “I mean, you’re talking about people that you’re not naming, and whether or not some things need to be improved, and what would you say to people that say some things. I mean, what things? What people? What are you referring to?” Priebus responded. “Give me a specific question with a specific purpose  —   accusation, and I’ll answer the question. ”   [Trump called the news media an ‘enemy of the American People.’ Here’s a history of the term.]   Sen. John McCain ( .) a vocal Trump critic, defended the free press in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” Suppressing the media, McCain said, is “how dictators get started. ”      White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and lawmakers of both political parties weigh in on President Trump’s Feb. 17 tweet calling several news outlets ”the enemy of the American People.” (Bastien   Washington Post)   The Trump administration’s aversion toward anonymous leaks to the media isn’t new. As Dickerson pointed out, it was a “familiar complaint” from previous White House occupants. Trump also isn’t the only president to wage a war against the media. And he isn’t the first one to use the word “enemy” to describe the media. “The press is your enemy,” President Richard Nixon said during a February 1971 meeting. “Enemies. Understand that?   …     Now, never act that way   …     give them a drink, you know, treat them nice, you just love it, you’re trying to be helpful. But don’t help the bastards. Ever. Because they’re trying to stick the knife right in our groin. ” The differences are the recipients of the message and the circumstances in which the words were uttered. Nixon was talking to one person: Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump was addressing the public  —   specifically, his more than 25 million Twitter followers.

"Dear Donald Trump: I’m an OB-GYN. There are no 9-month abortions..  At the final presidential debate, Donald Trump said doctors do abortions in the “ninth month” of pregnancy, that they “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. And that’s not acceptable. ”    I’m a doctor who was trained to do   abortions. I did them for five years in residency and for 10 years in practice and I have no idea what Trump is talking about. I have even practiced in states with no gestational age limit for abortions. So while I no longer perform abortions, I know much more about this subject than Donald Trump or any of his advisers can ever hope to know. Focusing on   abortions is always an interesting strategy. And certainly, if one really wanted to reduce abortion, it is the wrong strategy, as only 1. 3 percent of abortions happen at or after 21 weeks. We know this because the Centers for Disease Control (something you and I pay for with our federal tax dollars) conducts annual abortion surveillance. The majority of abortions, 91 percent in fact, happen before 13 weeks, and we know how to prevent most of them: easily accessible, free,   reversible contraception.  Since we can’t and shouldn’t count on Trump for facts about abortion, let’s set the record straight on   abortions, meaning those at or after 21 weeks. There are three reasons women seek   abortions: health of the mother, personal reasons, and fetal anomalies (birth defects).       abortions are rare  —   and women tend to seek them for three reasons Abortions for the health of the mother only happen before 24 weeks, which is the generally accepted   for fetal viability. After 24 weeks, if a pregnant person is sick enough that she needs to deliver for her health, obstetricians either induce labor or perform a   and the baby is attended by the neonatal intensive care unit.     Trump would apparently have you believe, and perhaps he believes himself, that in these situations doctors do a delivery and then commit infanticide. Health of the mother abortions absolutely do happen  —   in circumstances of ruptured membranes with an infection or deteriorating heart disease, for example  —   but they happen before 24 weeks. No   is doing   abortions for the health of the mother. We simply just practice obstetrics and deliver the baby by the most appropriate method.  A small percentage of   abortions (i. e. at or after 21 weeks) are for personal reasons. These procedures also don’t happen in the “ninth month” or one or two days from delivery. When a woman presents for an abortion and she is past 24 weeks, she is told that she is too far along for the procedure. There is even a medical term for this   —   turnaways. It has been studied, so we know exactly why women present too late: difficulty finding a provider; difficulty getting to the provider, especially given that some states require multiple visits; and difficulty affording the procedure.     Only nine states and the District of Columbia allow abortions after 24 weeks without restrictions. Is it possible one or two women may have an abortion at 24 or 25 weeks in these states and it not be for the health of mother? Technically yes, but honestly I’ve never heard of it happening. People seem to forget when they talk about these theoretical   week abortions for personal reasons that a pregnant person would need $15, 000 or more in cash.  So, considering the cost of abortions, the fact that fewer than 0. 3 percent occur at or after 21 weeks for   reasons, that most abortions will be before 24 weeks, and the expense of the procedure, it is simply ludicrous to insinuate that this happens regularly  —   never mind at all. And a “  abortion” of an otherwise healthy fetus? That is just untrue.   The only type of abortion that happens anywhere near nine months is for fetal anomalies The only type of abortion that does happen after 24 weeks is for fetal anomalies. Most abortions for fetal anomalies happen before 24 weeks, but a very small percentage happen later than that. The abortions that take place later do so because it takes time to do the ultrasounds and genetic testing. Sometimes a fetal MRI may even be needed.     Sadly, some women are lied to by   doctors in states with gestational age limits and get their genetic testing done on the late side because the doctor wants to try to take the possibility of an abortion off the table. I have personally heard of this happening.  However, even with the most      it can still be a race to get all the information and give a pregnant person time to think it over before 24 weeks. Sometimes the drastic nature of the problem isn’t fully realized until the pregnancy progresses. Other times a woman is carrying a fetus incompatible with life and thought she would go to term and let nature take its course, but then she realizes she just can’t. Who among us should judge those women?  When these procedures do happen, they could be an induction of labor, or some highly skilled providers can perform dilation and extraction procedures past 24 weeks. The closer to term (40 weeks) the more likely the procedure will be an induction of labor. So at 36 or 37 weeks, in most situations, the doctor will simply induce labor and after delivery not resuscitate the baby. However, there are rare medical situations where that might not be advisable, so the option of a dilation and extraction allows women in these situations to avoid a  .  The facts are that 98. 6 percent of abortions happen before 21 weeks. Most of the terminations at or after 21 weeks are very wanted pregnancies with serious fetal anomalies. Some are for the health of the mother and a very small percentage are for personal reasons. Almost all women who have later abortions for personal reason would have had the procedure sooner if they could have, so the very laws proposed by politicians who aim to restrict abortion (mostly under the false pretense of safety) actually lead to delays.  Donald Trump doesn’t understand women and abortion, at all I’ve counseled women about later term abortions. I’ve met with them, listened to their heartbreak, and used every ounce of my being to hold back my tears. I’ve comforted women and their partners sobbing about the fact their baby has no brain or can never breathe as their lungs have not developed. I’ve helped women figure out how to get the body of what had been a wanted pregnancy back home for burial. I’ve cared for women ravaged with infection at 22 or 23 weeks and sat worried by their bedside in the intensive care unit hoping that I did the abortion in time to save their life.  If Donald Trump has spent any time learning the facts and hearing the stories of women, he would know what I do: There is no “ ” abortion. It’s cruel to women who have walked the path of   abortion and it’s insulting.     Jennifer Gunter is an   and a pain medicine physician.

"Gunman in Orlando workplace rampage was Army vet. An Army veteran brandishing a handgun and a hunting knife unleashed a bloodbath at his former workplace in Orlando, Fla. on Monday,   authorities said. “Disgruntled’’ worker John Robert Neumann Jr. 45, “singled out” his victims as he opened fire at around 8 a. m. at the   company Fiamma Inc. said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings.  The carnage left three men and one woman dead at the scene. A fourth man died at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. “He had a plan of action, and he executed that plan today,’’ Demings said of Neumann, a loner who killed himself minutes later on Hanging Moss Road. The victims were identified by police as: Robert Snyder, 69; Brenda   44; Kevin Clark, 53; and Jeffrey Roberts, 57, and Kevin Lawson, 46.  Neumann Jr. who was honorably discharged from the Army in 1999 and lived alone in the area, had been fired from Fiamma in April, Demings said. The sheriff said the killer been involved in another incident at the business in June 2014 in which he “allegedly battered” a  . No charges resulted from that incident, and the   did not appear to be one of the victims who were slain, Demings said. But the gunman, who reloaded his semiautomatic pistol at least once during the shooting spree, had a “negative relationship” with at least one of the workers he shot, according to Demings. A surviving witness told police that Neumann Jr. “pointed a gun at her and told her to get out of there” as he continued firing off rounds. “He was certainly singling out the individuals he shot,” said Demings, who added that most of the victims were shot in the head. Eight people survived the attack.  The shooter had a criminal history involving “minor” offenses, including possession of marijuana, DUI and a misdemeanor battery charge, said Demings. A woman, Shelley Adams, told reporters that her sister, Sheila McIntyre, was in the bathroom of Fiamma, where McIntyre works, when the shots rang out. “She just heard a bang, and when she came out, she saw one person on the floor,” said Adams, who talked to her sister on the phone after the shooting. “She just kept saying, ‘I’m OK. My boss is dead! My boss is dead!’ Very, very upset,” Adams said. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was on the scene within two minutes of receiving the 911 call.  Officials from the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force also responded to the scene. The incident was later categorized as “workplace violence. ”",1.0
"5 ways the census income report misleads us about the real state of the economy.  I come not to praise Tuesday’s census report but to bury it. Or at least question its methodologies.    The Census Bureau’s annual report was almost NSFW reading for econ wonks. It showed that 2015 was the best year on record for household income growth, with the median American household’s income leaping 5. 2 percent in   terms, and both poverty and inequality falling. The news had the Obama administration’s economic team popping champagne corks, and sympathetic pundits like Jonathan Chait saying it will cement Obama’s legacy as a successful and transformative president.  And all that may be true. But the census income report is a deeply flawed data set, offering a confusing and somewhat inaccurate picture of the American economy.  This doesn’t necessarily undermine the celebrations. The ways in which the census’s data sets are flawed suggests the underlying reality might be even better than Tuesday’s rosy report suggested. But the uncertainty here should be acknowledged when we discuss the report.     Here’s a look at the five main issues: 1) The census definition of income leaves out a lot  If your boss took away your health insurance plan and gave you a nickel raise in exchange, you would probably be unhappy. Conversely, if the government raised taxes on the rich and used the revenue to give free health care to the poor, you would probably say inequality had gone down.    But the census definition of income looks pretty strictly at cash  —   including wages and salaries, Social Security benefits, and bonuses  —   and excludes taxes paid, earned income tax credit benefits received, and all kinds of noncash benefits. If you get something from the government that’s not cash  —   Medicare or Medicaid or SNAP, for example  —   that’s not income. And if you get something from your job that’s not cash  —   health insurance, a pension, free M&Ms, whatever  —   that’s not income either.  The upside to excluding noncash forms of income is that these can be difficult to value precisely.    The downside to excluding them is that while one can debate the exact value of   health insurance, the value clearly isn’t zero. This basic problem has become   to consumers of wonkish journalism as a problem with the Census Bureau’s official measurement of poverty, but the problems with the poverty threshold are largely a   consequence of the overall problem with the definition of income itself.  This has a few salient consequences:  The Obama administration’s main efforts to curb inequality by raising taxes on the rich and subsidizing health care for poor and   people are invisible to the census.  As health care grows as a share of what people consume, the Census Bureau records this as income stagnation because much of health care is consumed via   health benefits rather than intermediated by household cash. As the population ages and a larger share of people get Medicare, the value of those benefits is hidden.    The bottom line is that income growth has been stronger than the census reflects, especially for the elderly and for   households living in Medicaid expansion states, but rich people are paying higher taxes. 2) The census’s inflation measure is too pessimistic The Census Bureau adjusts for inflation using the consumer price index rather than either of the two main “chained” price indexes that economists generally regard as more accurate, and which tend to grow less year to year. (If you are interested in the details, read here.)      The reason the bureau still uses CPI is political. Some people want to use a shift to chained CPI and its lower estimation of inflation to reduce Social Security’s cost of living adjustments. Many people do not want to cut Social Security, and therefore resist this change, which in turn prevents a change in the census’s methodology.  In principle, it would be possible (and, in my opinion, desirable) to switch to chained CPI and then reinvest the money in making Social Security more generous to the poorest and oldest seniors. But that kind of political deal is very difficult to pull off in practice, so the easiest way to block Social Security cuts is to block a switch to chained CPI.  The census household data is collateral damage of this fundamentally unrelated political fight.  If the census used the more accurate chained CPI (or the Federal Reserve’s personal consumption expenditure deflator) it would show slightly lower inflation and slightly higher real income growth each year.    Median U. S. income has gone up, still below where it was in 1999 https:  .  #FightFor15 pic. twitter.  —   Fight For 15 (@fightfor15) September 14, 2016    The quantities involved here are relatively small, but it makes a big difference to political rhetoric. Both Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and many   groups are making a big deal out of the fact that, adjusted for inflation, median household income is still below its 1999 level. Using a chained inflation measure would show that income is higher today than it was back then. It’s a small dollar difference, but it’s the distinction between two fundamentally different stories:  “The American middle class is richer than it’s been at any previous point in history. ”  “The American middle class hasn’t gotten a raise in more than 15 years. ”   The choice of an inflation index is the difference between them. The first story is correct, and the second story is a   consequence of an important but fundamentally unrelated fight about Social Security spending.    3) Demographic effects make comparisons of median incomes tricky Baby boomers and millennials ruin everything, including census reports. Compared with 1999, the current American population contains a greater share of retired people and a greater share of people in their early 20s because the millennial and baby boom generations contain more people than the Silent Generation and Generation X cohorts. (This is, indeed, the meaning of the phrase “baby boom. ”)  The flip side is that in 1999, experienced   workers made up a larger share of our population. Both retired people and inexperienced workers earn less than veteran workers. Consequently, the demographic shift from millennials being small children to millennials being young workers pushes median household income down. The demographic shift from older boomers being experienced workers to being retirees also pushes median household income down.  This is not an error on the Census Bureau’s part in any way, but ignoring demographics gives you an excessively rosy view of the late ’90s and an excessively pessimistic view of the  . Individuals who become adults or enter retirement age are not typically experiencing actual economic hardship; they are just showing up in the numbers differently.  4) Household size is shrinking If your husband or wife leaves you, you will probably be sad (or maybe not; it’s not my business) and you might even be poorer in some sense, but you likely haven’t lost any of your personal income. Nevertheless, your household income might fall because you are now a   household with one income, whereas your household probably previously contained two people who earned income.     Depending on the details of your life (child support, housing arrangements, tax status, etc.) your actual disposable income may go up or down. But the census doesn’t care about disposable income; it’s very simplistically looking at household money income. When household size declines, so does household income.  Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute has a neat chart showing that even using the census income concept and sticking with the bad inflation index, income per household member hit an   high in 2015:         He also took a look specifically at household income for households that feature two working spouses, and you can see that it’s clearly at an   high:         One might say that declining household size is itself a problem  —   that Americans should be marrying and having kids at higher rates than they are. But when looking at census data, it’s important to keep in mind that you are seeing growth in income per person that is outpacing growth in income per household.  5) Survey data is hot garbage, and we keep using it even though there’s a better option Because I am not a criminal, I hand over detailed information about my income to the IRS on an annual basis. You probably do this too. Which means that the government, in the form of the IRS, has really detailed information about every American’s income. That is what’s known as “administrative data”  —   data derived from the actual functioning of a government program, in this case a big   apparatus.  The census report is survey data  —   basically a big poll. Polls are great when you don’t have better information.     But using a survey to assess Americans’ income in 2015 is a little like running a poll to figure out who won the 2012 election when you could count the votes instead. The problem here is federal privacy laws generally prohibit government statistical agencies from relying on administrative data to produce national economic statistics. The same applies, of course, to government social programs. Instead of running a poll on how many people get federal housing assistance, we could look at housing agencies’ records. When Bruce Meyer and Nikolas Mittag got access to New York state administrative data, they found massive undercounting in the surveys of the number of people who were getting useful stuff from the government. They found that more than a third of people getting housing assistance, 40 percent of people getting food stamps, and 60 percent of people getting TANF or   general assistance didn’t say so when surveyed. And even people who said they got assistance underestimated how much they were getting. In total, the administrative data showed that the poverty rate was about 2. 5 percentage points lower than the surveys showed.  We don’t really know what a comprehensive nationwide look at administrative data would show about the overall national income and poverty picture, but directionally the phenomenon of people underreporting government assistance is probably consistent.  America is pretty great The bottom line of all of this is that as good as the 2015 census report was, the reality is probably even better.  Properly measured, the typical household enjoys a higher income than ever before, even though the typical household also contains fewer people and a    share of the population is retired. Those retirees are better off than the income data reflects, because Medicare benefits are increasingly valuable as health care technology improves.   families, similarly, are better off due to their possession of   insurance.       households are also benefiting in ways the census doesn’t count from social assistance programs, including a Medicaid expansion that has pushed the uninsured rate to a record low. Even the main measures we have that do count the use of social aid programs are undercounting how many people they help and how much they are helped by. None of this is to deny that the United States continues to suffer from any number of social ills that could be improved. But social problems have always been with us. The data shows pretty clearly that despite those problems, we are currently living through the best of times.  ",-1.0
"Trump is cultivating a state of panic.   CLEVELAND  The notions that Donald Trump would make a typical presidential pivot, and that his divisive form of politics was merely a pose, lie dead on the convention floor in Cleveland. And it is now necessary to confront his unmasked contempt for American institutions.  Far from being confused or opportunistic, Trump has a consistent,   view of the universe and his (prominent) place within it. The world is in chaos. Our country is being infiltrated by   illegal immigrants and “massive . . . flows” of disloyal, unscreened refugees. American communities are overwhelmed by violence, impoverished by unfair trade and betrayed by politicians who refuse to “put America first. ” The institutions that are supposed to defend us are dominated by special interests and rigged by elites.  These claims are wrong, exaggerated or   in nearly every respect. But the message resonates. A majority of Americans regard their country as being on the “wrong track ” and have for some time. Conservative media and “breaking news”  cable networks reinforce this sense of decline and crisis.  And our institutional challenges are not imaginary: A     recession (to which Republicans have offered little practical response). Educational mediocrity concentrated in   communities. Congressional dysfunction. A Supreme Court that seems overly political and outcome driven. Everyone can find some reason for disillusionment.  But there are two possible responses to such failures. The first is the institutionalist answer: To rebuild with existing materials. To reform, repair, reclaim and renew our patrimony. The second alternative is the promise of deliverance by a man on horseback  —   a single leader claiming to embody the interests of “the people. ”  In Cleveland, Trump offered the second option with more forthright clarity than any politician in my lifetime. The speech contained almost no serious discussion of public policy or ideological argumentation. Instead, Trump said: “I am your voice. ” “I am not able to look the other way. ” “I know the time for action has come. ” “I can be your champion. ” “I will fight for you, and I will win for you. ”  As someone involved in GOP politics during a previous professional life, the moment was surreal, then emotional. A party with a distinguished history, generally led by men and women of public spirit and decency, has embraced a demagogue who may be a genuine threat to American democracy. Trump is cultivating a state of panic to increase public tolerance for political risk  —   in this case, the risk of a candidate who is untested, unprepared, unstable and unfit. And the requisite sense of emergency is being created by populating American nightmares with migrants, refugees and Muslims. Standing on the convention floor, I could see what the face of American authoritarianism might look like.  If Trump is elected president, he can justly claim a mandate to pursue the enemies of the people, foreign and domestic. If he tests the limits of executive power to punish rivals and intimidate opponents, he has hidden none of his intentions.  The Caesarian option  —   rolling the dice with a populist authoritarian, using democratic majorities to undermine democratic structures  —   is common in history. Any Latin American or African can tell you what strongmen or “big men” are like.  But Trump’s version of “Americanism” is not, in fact, very American. Our constitutional system was designed to make personal rule both impossible and unnecessary. The idea that political salvation might be found simply by replacing one leader at the top of government would have been regarded as perverse by the Founders. The United States has benefited from skilled leaders  —   a Lincoln or an FDR  —   at moments of genuine national crisis. But this is not such a time. And this is not such a leader.  Does institutionalism still have defenders in American public life? Certainly there are members of the Senate and House who would resist and balance the ambitions of a President Trump. But history has often shown that unscrupulous executive power can run circles around a divided legislature.  It is also hard for me to regard Hillary Clinton  —   whatever her other virtues  —   as the savior of institutional integrity. While she would be preferable, on this score, to Trump, she has her own history of disregard for the rules and procedures that govern other mortals.  However quixotic the attempt may currently seem, the country needs a committed institutionalist in the presidential race. Those distinguished Americans who have taken a pass on running as a   candidate should watch Trump’s Cleveland speech once again, and weigh the very real risk to the republic.

"A Harrowing Journey Up the World's Fifth Highest Mountain. Makalu is the world's fifth highest mountain, soaring to 27,765 feet. Makalu is known for its pyramid shape, with four steep ridges leading to a sharp peak. Photographer Tim Taylor joined an expedition to Makalu with the British Armed Forces in September 2014. He captured this image at 23,000 feet. The team included eight climbers from the UK, plus Sherpas, cooks, and support staff. The expedition scaled the mountain via its southeast ridge, which is incredibly sharp and dangerous. After establishing base camp, the team attacked the mountain ""siege"" style, slowly pitching a small series of camps higher and higher up the mountain. This image was taken above camp two at 23,000 feet. A treacherous storm rolled in mid-October, forcing those on the expedition to retreat. After that, they made one last push to reach 26,247 feet but didn't scale the summit. Taylor doesn't see it as a defeat. He was there for the photos—which are incredible. Taylor shot the images in color with a Canon 5D MKIII camera, converting to black and white later in post-production. The final prints can be as wide as nine feet, creating a window into nature. This image depicts Mount Tutse, as seen from above base camp on Makalu .""There's a stark, elemental beauty to the high mountain landscape, an almost alien world,"" Taylor says. The black and white tones emphasize the contrasting quality of light and shadow on the mountain, with white snow so thick it looks dragged from an artist's palette knife, and rocks so steep and jagged that they abstract into inky blackness. This image was taken at 21,000 feet on Makalu's southeast ridge. ""I see a photograph as a question posed, rather than an answer or a statement,"" Taylor says. ""These voyages into nature with a camera have been as much an inward journey as an outward one."" ""As a photographer, and a human being, I'm interested in the transformative power of these landscapes that allow us to see ourselves in a different perspective and call into question our modern relationship to nature,"" Taylor says. Makalu is the world's fifth highest mountain—an icy giant 14 miles west of Everest that straddles the border of northeastern Nepal and Tibet. Its four sharp ridges ascend almost vertically toward a 27,765-foot summit that's formidable to even the most experienced climbers. Since 1955, there have been fewer than 300 recorded attempts to scale it, roughly a third of how many were made at its more famous neighbor last year alone. Tim Taylor had never climbed anything so big or challenging before he joined an expedition to reach Makalu's summit five years ago. Actually, Taylor hadn't even heard of Makalu before an email from his mountaineering club arrived in his inbox, announcing that the British Armed Forces was seeking a photographer to document the trek. But he was ready for an adventure. ""It completely captured my imagination,"" he says. ",0.0
"John Kasich is the establishment’s last best hope against Trump.  Donald Trump’s march to the nomination is up against a roadblock in Ohio: Kasichmentum.    Gov. John Kasich, who barely registered in national polls for most of the primary, just beat Trump in his home state of Ohio, a    state worth 66 delegates. It still puts Kasich behind Ted Cruz in the delegate count, which doesn’t make for an easy path to victory.  But winning the nomination at this point is not Kasich’s primary goal. Rather, he is positioning himself to strip as many delegates away from Trump as possible  —   and he’s gambling that if he plays his cards right, he might be the person to prevail in the ensuing chaos. The Republican establishment is hoping Trump will arrive at the convention with only a plurality of delegates, rather than the majority needed to win the nomination outright. That could potentially let them block him through a contested convention. But to have a decent chance, they need someone to beat Trump in at least one big state on Tuesday. Now that Marco Rubio was blown out in Florida, that leaves Kasich as the establishment’s last best hope.    Kasich has positioned himself as the   Throughout the primary season, Kasich has deliberately campaigned as the only ”nice guy” in the field, declining to take swipes at his opponents for incremental political gains.    He has sought to make his pragmatism a point of contrast between himself and Trump, particularly after bouts of violence broke out at Trump rallies over the weekend, incited by Trump’s rhetoric. ”Ohio is going to send a message that we don’t accept those kinds of tactics,” he said at a rally this weekend. ”That’s why I’m going to win in this state, that’s why it’ll be a whole new ballgame.”    But even earlier in the campaign, when Kasich was seeking to make himself competitive in New Hampshire, he softened what were often described as ”brusque” or ”cranky” edges. On the trail, he referred to himself as ”the prince of light and hope”  —   an obvious allusion to Trump’s insults and rage. To be fair, though numerous reports rebut his ”nice guy” persona, Kasich has seemed to display more of a concern for the poor and disadvantaged, even before he decided to run for president. In 2013, he became one of the few Republicans to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and vetoed Republican legislators’ efforts to undo that expansion. (That action alone has fueled many of the claims that Kasich is a ”moderate. ”) He has also been known to increase spending on   welfare programs, a fact that has not won him many friends among Republican politicians.    And those efforts, combined with an optimistic tone on the trail, seem to be paying off for Kasich in states that have large proportions of voters looking for a more pragmatic Trump alternative. In New Hampshire, for example, exit polling shows that voters looking for a clear Trump alternative turned to Kasich. Voters who said they were ”dissatisfied” (rather than ”angry”) with Washington overwhelmingly voted for Kasich. Republicans with a college degree picked Kasich, while Trump drew a groundswell of support from voters with only a high school education. And Kasich was the top choice of Republicans saying they’d like to elect a president with previous experience in government, even beating out Marco Rubio in New Hampshire. Kasich is an orthodox Republican who knows how to work across the aisle In contrast to the frontrunners  —   who have adopted extreme, arguably unachievable positions such as deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants  —   Kasich has been wrongly cast as a moderate. Kasich is no moderate. More precisely, he is an orthodox Republican on fiscal and social issues, with an occasional independent streak. The Ohio Republican got his start in politics with an election to the state Senate in 1976. Kasich, who ousted a sitting Democrat, was only 26 at the time and became the youngest state senator in Ohio’s history. He went on to serve in the House from 1983 to 2001, developing his reputation as a devout fiscal conservative. He targeted programs for cuts across the board, including programs supported by both Democrats and fellow Republicans. He teamed up with an unlikely ally, Ralph Nader, to cut down on corporate tax loopholes, and elsewhere took repeated aim at wasteful defense spending.    During his career in the House, Kasich is perhaps best known for chairing the Budget Committee in the latter half of Bill Clinton’s presidency. Under his leadership, Congress balanced the federal budget for the first time in nearly 30 years, partly by   Medicare. He also shepherded passage of the   welfare reform bill of 1996, which made welfare benefits more temporary. Kasich also talks about his time in the House to demonstrate his willingness to cross the aisle. Though that was occasionally true  —   he famously voted in favor of the 1994 assault weapons ban, a fact he’s not likely to publicize now  —   he mostly stuck to his fiscally conservative agenda. As governor of Ohio, a position he gained in 2010, Kasich has furthered this record as an unmistakable conservative. One of his first acts in public office was an attempt to restrict the power of public employee unions, similar to the type of reform that his northern neighbor, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, achieved. He signed a law that prohibited all public employees from striking and restricted their ability to negotiate health care and pension benefits. But the law received swift backlash. In 2011, a repeal measure was placed on the Ohio ballot, and the law was struck down by a 61 to 39 percent margin. Following that defeat, Kasich dropped further efforts to curb collective bargaining. But he has forged ahead on other issues. He has opposed regulating coal in his state, a major industry there, despite being one of the few Republicans in his party to acknowledge human involvement in climate change. He opposed any efforts to legalize recreational or medical marijuana in his state, though when asked whether he would enforce federal drug laws against states who have legalized the substance, he wavered.    And on the issue of abortion, Kasich’s loyalties are unequivocal: He signed no fewer than 16 new   provisions into Ohio law, including one barring abortion providers from seeking admitting privileges with public hospitals. (Abortion providers are required to have such admitting privileges at a hospital to remain open.) He also stripped about $1. 4 million in funding from Planned Parenthood, sending chunks of the money instead to crisis pregnancy centers, which do not provide abortion referrals. Overall, he maintains a favorable rating in the high 70s among Ohio Republicans, a sign he’s kept his party pleased. The fact that Trump has nevertheless made Ohio a competitive primary state, against a hugely popular sitting governor, is a real testament to how much Trump has upended the race. Kasich can’t win the nomination, but that’s not the point Over the past few weeks, Kasich remained   on winning Ohio, barnstorming up and down the state with a fiercely optimistic and   message. His campaign organization, in coordination with the state Republican Party, has laid out a formidable ground game that his team is betting will win him the state. From here, they’re hoping his win will propel him to the sort of name recognition needed to win Northeastern states, where the primary calendar will soon turn. But the delegate math is daunting. Ohio, one of the first    states, carries 66 delegates. That more than doubles Kasich’s present total, at 63. Still, his current standing makes it essentially impossible for him to reach the 1, 237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, even if he does begin racking up wins in more states as the race progresses. (That proposition in itself is daunting, given Trump’s successes in states like New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts.)    Trump, who currently holds 464 delegates, is much closer to reaching the magic number  —   which was why Kasich wanted to snatch Ohio away from him. Kasich is no longer pretending that the reality is any different, openly acknowledging that his strategy involves forcing a contested convention. ”No one is going to have the numbers,” he said on ABC last week. Commentators have therefore included Kasich in a larger   strategy, framing the stakes in Ohio as more of a blow to Trump than a personal victory for the Ohio governor. Mitt Romney, who has implored the Republican Party to do what it can to stop Trump, recorded robocalls supporting Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in Florida. Even Rubio’s campaign, in a   stop Trump effort, urged voters in Ohio to pick Kasich over him in that contest.    But Kasich, ever the optimist, has his own ideas. His campaign rejected Rubio’s support and did not instruct Kasich voters in Florida to flock to Rubio, as some Republicans might have hoped. In refusing to cooperate in a coordinated Trump takedown strategy, Kasich may be inadvertently helping the frontrunner by continuing to split votes. But in his estimation, the move was necessary to force Rubio out of the race, leaving him as the last establishment Republican standing. It worked. ",-1.0
"Read leaked drafts of 4 White House executive orders on Muslim ban, end to DREAMer program, and more.  On Tuesday, Vox was given six documents that purported to be draft executive orders under consideration by the Trump administration. The source noted that “all of these documents are still going through formal review” in the Executive Office of the President and “have not yet been cleared by [the Department of Justice or the Office of Legal Counsel]. ”     We were not, at the time, able to verify the authenticity of the documents and did not feel it would be reasonable to publish or report on them.  But on Wednesday afternoon, Trump signed two executive orders on immigration that    matched the drafts we’d received. Given that our source had early access to two documents that were proven accurate, and that all the orders closely align with Trump’s stated policies on the campaign trail, we are reporting on the remaining four.  The source cautioned that “there are substantive comments on several of these drafts from multiple elements of NSC staff” and “if previous processes remain the norm, there [are] likely to be some substantive revisions. ” It is possible these orders will emerge with substantial changes, or even be scrapped altogether.     We sent the White House PDFs of the documents and left voicemails with aides, but did not receive a response.     The two orders released today by the Trump administration, and delivered yesterday by our source, start the process of building President Trump’s famous ”wall,” and make it easier for immigration agents to arrest, detain, and deport unauthorized immigrants at the border and in the US. Those policies are explained in detail here. The four remaining draft orders obtained by Vox focus on immigration, terrorism, and refugee policy. They wouldn’t ban all Muslim immigration to the US, breaking a Trump promise from early in his campaign, but they would temporarily ban entries from seven   countries and bar all refugees from coming to the US for several months. They would make it harder for immigrants to come to the US to work, make it easier to deport them if they use public services, and put an end to the Obama administration program that protected young ”DREAMer” immigrants from deportation.    In all, the combined documents would represent one of the harshest crackdowns on immigrants  —   both those here and those who want to come here  —   in memory. The “Muslim ban”: “Protecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals” The draft executive order limiting immigration from certain   countries, formally titled, ”Protecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals,” suspends entry into the United States from selected countries starting 30 days after the executive order’s issuance.  On the campaign trail, Trump made comments about banning Muslims from the United States. This order is reminiscent of that promise but falls far short of it, as most   countries, including the most populous ones (Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan) are not included on the list of barred countries.    The countries in question are those included in the State Department’s list of   countries (Iran, Sudan, and Syria) those designated by the Department of Homeland Security as countries of concern (Libya, Somalia, and Yemen) and Iraq, which is specially designated in the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, the law from which the executive order gets its list of barred countries. (Syria is specially designated too, but it’s already banned due to the terrorism list.)  That law simply limited travel from countries whose residents normally don’t need a visa to visit the US (which tend to be rich countries like the UK, France, and Germany) if they had previously traveled to a country of concern, like Iran or Yemen or Iraq. Trump’s executive order uses that list and bars all immigration from those countries outright. As this ban is being implemented, the secretary of homeland security, along with the secretary of state and director of national intelligence, is instructed to evaluate which countries do and don’t provide enough information about visa applicants for the US to vet them for terrorism risk. Any countries that don’t provide enough information, according to the secretary of homeland security, will be given 60 days to start doing so. After those 60 days, the secretary of homeland security will provide to the president a list of any countries still judged to not be providing enough information. The president will then issue a proclamation prohibiting nationals of those countries from entering the United States. This list will replace the one based on the 2015 law. The order also suspends all refugee admissions into the United States for 120 days, as the secretary of state reviews refugee application procedures to ensure they guarantee no admitted refugees jeopardize national security. All refugee applications will be placed on hold for this   period, and resumed once the secretary has issued revised procedures  —   except for applications from members of “religious minorities” who are being persecuted (which, in practice, will probably mean Christians in the Middle East). Refugees will continue to be barred from countries that don’t have adequate safeguards, as determined by the secretaries of state and homeland security and the director of national intelligence. Refugee claims ”on the basis of   persecution” will be given priority, and all admissions of Syrian refugees will be suspended until President Trump determines they can begin again. The total number of refugees allowed in fiscal year 2017 will be reduced from 110, 000 to 50, 000, and preference will continue to go to “religious minorities. ” The order instructs the secretary of state to provide ”safe areas” in Syria and surrounding areas where Syrian nationals who have been displaced can reside. It also instructs the secretary of homeland security to speed implementation of a biometric   tracking system. Finally, the order instructs the secretary of state to ”immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program,” and requires interviews of all   visa seekers.    Read the full draft order here.  DREAMer program: “Ending unconstitutional executive amnesties”  Another apparent order draft, titled “Ending unconstitutional executive amnesties,” would end a major Obama program that has effectively protected more than 740, 000 unauthorized immigrants from deportation since 2012. This program  —   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA  —   was aimed at people who came to the US when they were younger than 16 years old, who either had pursued or were pursuing education and had no felony convictions, among other conditions. It let them get temporary protection from deportation and permits to work in the US. But the order would end the DACA program. Now, it says that work permits already issued under the program will remain valid. However, these permits are all already set to expire at some point in the next two years, and once they expire, they will not be renewed, according to the order. Starting very soon, a trickle of immigrants would start to lose their DACA protections  —   and by January 2019, barring a policy reversal or an act of Congress, all of them would. Even while still protected by DACA, the order says, the government will not grant them “advance parole. ” That means that should they leave the country, they would not be allowed to return. Finally, this draft order would also put the nail in the coffin of Obama’s 2014 attempt to extend that program to cover a broader group of unauthorized immigrants  —   DAPA  —   which had already been blocked in court. All in all, if implemented, the order would roll back President Obama’s most significant legacy on immigration. Read the full draft order here. Limiting legal immigration: “Protecting American Jobs and Workers by Strengthening the Integrity of Foreign Worker Visa Programs”  A sweeping proposed order would, essentially, operate across a number of channels to reduce the scope of legal immigration to the United States. It also begins to lay the administrative and policy groundwork for further legislation altering the scope of legal immigration into one that, in the words of the cover memo, “prioritizes the interests of American workers and  —   to the maximum degree possible  —   the jobs, wages, and   of those workers. ”    The order itself contains a variety of provisions. One would reverse Obama’s extension of the duration of Optional Practical Training work visas and decision to allow the spouses of   guest workers to also have work permits. Another would undo relief Obama has granted to people eligible for green cards but unable to apply for them due to what’s known as the “  and   bars. ” Another provision calls on the Department of Homeland Security to begin “site visits” at places that employ guest workers with   visas and then to expand the   program to cover all   visa programs within two years. Other provisions are less clear in their impact. The order directs the secretary of homeland security to promulgate a regulation that would “restore the integrity of   nonimmigrant worker programs” and to “consider ways” to alter the   program (for technical guest workers) to be “more efficient and ensure that beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest. ” The   program, which is often used by outsourcing firms, has come under recent criticism from both Trumpist Republicans and   Democrats, and the Trump administration is reportedly looking at another way to determine which of the hundreds of thousands of   applicants get visas (instead of the current lottery system).  Another directs DHS to “improve monitoring of foreign students” and to “reform practical training programs for foreign students to prevent the disadvantaging of US students in the workforce. ” Another calls for the promulgation of a new regulation to “clarify comprehensively” that people on tourist visas may not perform skilled or unskilled labor. Another directs the secretary of state to “reform the   Summer Work Travel program to improve protections of US workers. ” Another provision calls on DHS to do what it can to incentivize more employers to participate in the   system.  Last but by no means least, the order attempts to build momentum toward a larger revision of American immigration policy. It calls on the secretary of labor to commission a report investigating “the extent of any injury to US workers” caused by the employment of foreign workers, and on DHS to report regularly on the number of foreigners working in the United States and to “immediately restart work on regular benefit fraud assessments for all immigration benefits categories. ”     Read the full draft order here. Limiting social services: “Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote Accountability and Responsibility” Libertarians sometimes suggest “building a wall around the welfare state” instead of the country  —   restricting access to public benefits to US citizens. This executive order proposes that President Trump, who’s already building a wall around the country, build one around the welfare state as well. Legal immigrants currently get access to some public benefits in some circumstances. But the federal government can bar someone from coming to the US, or from becoming a permanent resident, if there’s any evidence he or she will become a “public charge. ”  Currently, the federal government looks at use of cash benefits (like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) when it’s making “public charge” decisions, but not   benefits like Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. This executive action, though, would ask the Department of Homeland Security to issue a rule saying that an immigrant can’t be admitted to the US if he’s likely to get any benefit “determined in any way on the basis of income, resources, or financial need. ” Furthermore, people who use any of those benefits and are in the US on visas would be subject to deportation. The order would require the person who sponsored an immigrant into the US to reimburse the federal government for any benefits the immigrant used. It would direct the government to publish regular reports on the benefits used by immigrants in the US  —   and how that money could be “reinvested” in the inner cities, something Trump proposed as a candidate.  One of the reports requested in the order would be a report on the cost of the entire Refugee Assistance Program  —   the program by which the US helps refugees get settled, obtain jobs, and learn English. Refugees are responsible for much of immigrant welfare use in the US, because they’re not selected for their high earning potential  —   they’re selected because of their humanitarian need. But consistent with the forthcoming order restricting refugee admissions entirely, this memo sees refugees as a drain on the public coffers. Unauthorized immigrants aren’t spared by the order: It would prevent families from getting the child tax credit if the parents are unauthorized (even if the children are US citizens) and it would prevent an unauthorized immigrant from being eligible for Social Security during the time he was unauthorized (even if he was paying into the system, as many do, using a fake Social Security number). But for the most part, this order doesn’t crack down on unauthorized immigrants to protect legal immigrants; it cracks down on immigrants, and their US citizen children, for the sake of the  .

"America’s evolving views on crime, explained by Law & Order: SVU.  On Wednesday, March 30, 2016, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit did something extraordinary: It asked viewers to empathize with an admitted rapist.    SVU, which returned for its 18th season on Wednesday, is not a subtle show. For those who haven’t watched, it’s a pulpy cop procedural with a penchant for    almost   implausible plot twists. Its focus on sex crimes can be both empowering (it puts a huge emphasis on believing women) and frustrating in its sensationalistic focus on the grisliest details of sexual violence (as in an arc involving a serial killer who menaces the unit’s lead detective). That formula has also earned it an avid following; last season it averaged 8. 3 million viewers per episode, more than the likes of Quantico or The Bachelorette, and reruns on the USA Network used to frequently beat new episodes of Mad Men. Historically, SVU has not depicted the sex offenders targeted by its detectives with much nuance, let alone sympathy. The team’s longtime   psychiatrist, Dr. George Huang (B. D. Wong) went from treating sex offenders to helping law enforcement because he concluded they could not be cured. At times the show has flirted with sympathy for vigilante justice; at times, its own detectives have taken part.    But after 17 seasons, something appears to be changing. That March 30 episode, ”Sheltered Outcasts” (season 17, episode 19) takes a more nuanced approach to sex offenders. Detective Dominick Carisi (Peter Scanavino) embeds undercover for weeks at a homeless shelter with a special section for convicted sex offenders, suspecting a resident is responsible for a string of rapes nearby. While on the case, he befriends Richie Caskey (Michael Rapaport) who moved into the sex offender section after serving 10 years in prison for raping a cocktail waitress at a bachelor party.    The crime that landed Caskey in the shelter was despicable, but he appears sincerely horrified by and repentant for his actions. Which makes it all the more painful when initial evidence suggests Caskey might be responsible for the serial rapes Carisi is investigating. But Caskey is ultimately proven innocent; his lawyer was committing the rapes, assuming someone at the shelter would get blamed, given their past crimes. Carisi’s sympathy for Caskey isn’t debunked; it’s confirmed. ”I went into that place, I hated those guys. I couldn’t even stand to be around them,” he tells Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish). ”But after a few days, they just turned into people.”    The episode is the culmination of years of evolution on the show toward a more nuanced and compassionate depiction of sex offenders  —   one that matches an emerging, more nuanced public conversation on the topic. The public and the press are starting to acknowledge the horrible effects of sex offender registration laws, the difficult reality that some pedophiles do not want to act on their impulses and need support and therapy rather than punishment, and the ways in which our horror at sex crimes helps drive mass incarceration. And SVU is starting to adjust in turn. For its entire   history, SVU has served as a mirror of attitudes about criminal justice and feminism  —   not the attitudes of Americans generally, but of the fairly liberal audience it targets. In its first decade, the detectives would make light of prison rape and vilify defendants. Today, the show often takes pains to acknowledge the humanity of even suspects who turn out to be guilty. If you want to see how the conversation on criminal justice and sex crimes has evolved over the past two decades, you could do a lot worse than   SVU.    The unique appeal of SVU              SVU started as a spinoff of the main Law & Order series but soon developed an identity of its own. It shares the ”ripped from the headlines” hustle of the original, but both because its breakout lead character is a woman  —   Detective Olivia Benson, played by Mariska Hargitay  —   and because of its subject matter, it has cultivated a different, less conservative image. Most cop procedurals have a fairly utopian view of law enforcement: Police usually play by the rules, defendants are frequently assigned excellent representation, and the main challenge is dotting the prosecution’s i’s and crossing its t’s so key evidence doesn’t get tossed out on a technicality. SVU, by contrast, is focused on crimes traditionally minimized by the police, a fact that it rarely forgets. Its victims are overwhelmingly women and children. Its perps are almost always men  —   usually white, frequently rich and powerful. To some extent, this twist to the formula was a canny response by producer Dick Wolf to the fact that the Law & Order franchise’s most devoted fans have always been professional women. ”My closest chum in Washington is a political columnist and TV pundit,” columnist Michael Kinsley once observed. ”I thought I knew her pretty well. Turns out that for years, on all those evenings when I assumed she was at parties to which I wasn’t invited, she was at home watching reruns of Law & Order. The dean of a major business school poured out a similar confession, as did a senior editor at a newsmagazine. The girlfriend of one of my Slate colleagues.   …     Always women. Always  . Always Law & Order.” The musician Amanda Palmer put it more bluntly: ”Who needs love when there’s Law & Order”? But the traditional Law & Order was always  . The original cast contained no women. The executive assistant district attorney was always a man, either Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty) or Michael Cutter (Linus Roache). The two lead homicide detectives were always men. In a typical season, the only female main cast members would be S. Epatha Merkerson (as Lt. Anita Van Buren) and whichever   ADA is working under McCoy at that moment. SVU, by contrast, always had a female lead detective in Benson. The ADA was, until season 14, always a woman. Medical examiner Melinda Warner (Tamara Tunie) has been a crucial part of the show since season two.    From its premiere, the New Yorker’s Emily Nussbaum notes, ”SVU felt like a woman’s show, at once prurient and cathartic, exploitative and liberating  —   with an appeal much like that of the old Lifetime channel, that   chamber of horrors. The audience was   female, young women, for the most part  —   the same demographic that drives fan fiction, romance novels, and vampire stories.” This is baked into the show’s very structure. The typical original Law & Order episode is split   between the investigation and the trial. The latter typically involves few plot twists, focusing instead on legal strategy, which limits how convoluted the story can get. SVU is typically 100 percent investigation, with only the occasional episode featuring time at trial. That means writers can pack in even more twists and turns, taking plots into genuinely bizarre, implausible, and wacky places. This creates a distinctive pulpy tinge that ultimately sets the show apart from its parent series. Law & Order is a fundamentally serious show about serious topics. It barely has a sense of humor. SVU, largely because of its greater penchant for twists, is a deeply, deeply silly (and mercifully  ) show. This is a series where Marcia Gay Harden screams, ”WHITE POWER,” while doing a Hitler salute in an open courtroom as gunshots ring out, where Outkast’s Big Boi plays a rapper named ”Gots Money” who is eaten by hyenas, where the unit’s lieutenant rescues a gibbon monkey from inside a basketball (the latter two happen in the same episode). It is soapy nonsense of the finest quality  —   despite, or perhaps as a respite from, its focus on the immensely serious and sensitive topic of sexual violence. The    years             Women’s show or not, SVU had the misfortune of premiering in 1999. Urban violent crime, whose historically high levels in the ’70s and ’80s set the stage for the original Law & Order, had peaked and was falling precipitously, but public opinion and culture always respond to changing social circumstances with a lag. The result was a public that was still terrified of crime and had high confidence in police. A Gallup poll in 2001 found that 62 percent of Americans worried ”a great deal” about crime. By 2016, that was down to 53 percent. In 2014, before the Ferguson protests raised the profile of criminal justice as an issue, only 39 percent said they worried a great deal  —   a   drop from 2001. Similarly, Gallup has found that Americans’ faith in police grew over the early 2000s, during the early seasons of SVU, before falling in recent years, particularly among Democrats  —   disproportionately SVU’s audience.    So it’s perhaps unsurprising that for the first decade or so of the show’s existence, it espoused a rather reactionary politics around crime. Prisoners’ suffering was disregarded or played for laughs. ”You know how to play ’Getting the Dice’?” Detective Fin Tutuola ( ) asked Big Boi during an interrogation, taking out two dice. ”Your cellie rolls the dice. [He rolls them.] Nine. That’s how many days you get to play his girlfriend.” It’s disconcerting to see a show about sexual assault flagrantly trivialize prison rape, but there you have it. On another occasion, ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal) gloats to a serial killer played by Jared Harris about the new prison assignment she got him: ”You’re gonna love Florence supermax  —     lockdown, no visitors, no mail, no phone calls. No human contact for the rest of your life.” What Novak is describing is unambiguously torture. The audience is supposed to view this treatment as a victory. Any notion that sex offenders could benefit from treatment or rehabilitation was strictly absent. One of the most upsetting episodes of SVU to watch now is season 10’s ”Confession,” which begins with a    boy walking into the precinct and confessing that he’s been having sexual thoughts about his    stepbrother. He hasn’t hurt his brother at all, because he knows to do so would be wrong, but he doesn’t know how to handle his feelings, and so he asks the SVU detectives for help. Benson responds not by trying to pair the boy with a therapist but by trying to build a case against him, telling his mother, ”We believe that he’s been abusing Cory.” Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) harangues the kid in an interrogation room, yelling, ”You’re the one who sexually abused your    stepbrother.” Lest you think the detectives learn a valuable lesson about the perils of prosecuting thought crime, or about targeting people who come to them trying to do the right thing, it ultimately turns out the kid has abused someone. Any chance the episode had of painting a nuanced, empathetic portrait of ”gold star pedophiles”  —   people with pedophilic urges who do not act upon them  —   went out the window. Suspects are, once again, liars to be treated with suspicion and hostility. But even as the show exhibited a callous disregard for the rights and humanity of suspects and perps, it never wavered in its core commitment to believing the victims. From the very start, the show went to great lengths to emphasize that victims’ past sexual history has no bearing on the merit of their allegations. Sex workers are frequently featured as victims, but their career is never treated as a reason not to believe them.    There’s a healthy academic literature analyzing SVU that confirms this. Sociologists Nicole Rader and Gayle   conducted a content analysis comparing the  ’04 season of SVU with regular Law & Order, CSI, and Without a Trace and found that SVU was ”the most likely to characterize victims as unlikeable but not culpable and least likely to characterize victims as manipulative”  —   in keeping with the show’s attempt to show that even victims who are not ”perfect” should be believed. Boston College’s Lisa Cuklanz and Middlebury’s Sujata Moorti conducted a content analysis of all 116 episodes of the show’s first five seasons and are even more rapturous in their conclusions. ”Unequivocally asserting that consent  —   rather than the conduct of the victim  —   is central to definitions of rape, SVU narratives repeatedly showcase assaults on prostitutes,” they note. ”SVU narratives repeatedly declare that a person’s sexual practices must not be used to undermine the person’s credibility. The series rejects the assumption that only virtuous and sexually chaste women can be violated   …     SVU offers an unequivocally feminist understanding of sexual assault in its depiction of power imbalances as causing rape.” The authors do note that SVU showcases disproportionate number of female perpetrators  —   but when it comes to debunking rape myths, the show rarely if ever wavers. Even when individual characters express belief in rape myths, they are immediately rebuked. In a season 11 episode, Stabler’s teenage son tells him about a fellow high schooler he knows who said she was assaulted by a football player.  ”Everyone says she’s a lying slut,” he tells his father. Stabler reacts immediately: ”Don’t ever talk about a victim like that.” Believing the victim             SVU’s set of precepts on sexual assault were a perfect match for the nascent feminist blogosphere of the late ’00s, which broke into the mainstream press in a major way in the ’10s. And, not unrelatedly, campus, military, and celebrity sexual assault started to be reported on and treated as serious issues in a way they never had been before, with the kind of feminist analysis of rape SVU had adopted and propounded  —   victims should not have to be perfect, their past sexual behavior is irrelevant, rape is about power, not sex, victims should be believed  —   gaining new prominence in turn. Olivia Benson, specifically, became a kind of cult heroine for activists and writers working on sexual assault issues. ”Olivia Benson is much more than a TV character  —   she’s a support system and role model,” an anonymous contributor to the essay collection We Believe You: Survivors of Campus Sexual Assault Speak Out wrote. ”I can count on her.” ”SVU offers viewers an alternate reality where sexual assault survivors are taken seriously and justice is obtainable thanks to a crack team of   detectives, each one fluent in the language of sexual assault,” Vice’s Alex Hughes elaborates.    And the show and its crew returned the love, adopting the vernacular of sexual assault advocates; the term ”slut shaming” has appeared in SVU scripts repeatedly. Hargitay pivoted heavily into actual activism, founding the Joyful Heart Foundation, which focuses on preventing sexual assault and domestic violence and supporting survivors. She’s collaborated with Vice President Joe Biden on the issue, culminating in Biden filming a cameo on the show for the upcoming 18th season. The ”ripped from the headlines” aspect of the show  —   while still a recipe for lurid, uncomfortable content on occasion  —   also became a way for it to retell stories in the news with a      slant. One, based on the story of Duke student and adult film star Belle Knox, sees a college student who also works in porn assaulted by two classmates who insist that because she’s in porn, she must consent to whatever they want. The show is clear that it’s the student’s right to express her sexuality how she wants, that her career is absolutely no excuse for rape, and that the ultimate problem is a culture that enables assaults. Knox herself walked away from the experience impressed, writing, ”I am happy that ‘my’ character was not portrayed as a caricature of the porn industry, but as an imperfect young woman who made some controversial choices that did not define her.” Another, based on the   Rolling Stone account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia, faced a challenge, given the show’s commitment to showing viewers that most allegations of rape are legitimate and false reports are rare. SVU handled the situation by pointedly refusing to place the blame on the student whose claims fell apart. In the SVU version, the student really was assaulted, by one classmate  —   and, because of pressure from the press and an irresponsible professor, embellished the events into a gang rape. ”I don’t blame Heather,” Olivia Benson says at the episode’s conclusion. ”[Reporter] Skip Peterson and Professor Dillon, they pressured her into coming forward. They thought this would be the case that would change rape culture, and it did. It set the clock back 30 years.” The show’s takeaway is clear: This one event does not change the fact that false reports are rare and our society has a problem believing women.    Treating suspects like people But if SVU was ahead of its time on its treatment of rape and consent, it lagged behind public opinion in its treatment of crime in its first decade, with DAs threatening tortuous solitary confinement and detectives joking about the assaults suspects would endure in prison. By the 2010s  —   when the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases and the crime decline increased support for criminal justice reform and raised the profile of racial bias by police  —   that approach appeared increasingly untenable. However, the public’s declining appetite for    policies and increasing awareness and sensitivity toward sexual assault occurred simultaneously. This, necessarily, caused some tension. Many sexual assault advocates viewed the answer as tougher enforcement of the law. As Scott Berkowitz, founder of RAINN, America’s leading   assault nonprofit, declared in 2012, ”The single most important thing we can do to prevent rape is to put more rapists in prison.” Most criminal justice reform advocates, by contrast, view this approach as fundamentally flawed. Some have accused   sexual assault groups like RAINN of embracing a ”carceral feminism,” which serves to bolster a system of overcriminalization and mass incarceration that ultimately hurts women. This dispute has spilled over into legislatures. The Brock Turner rape case at Stanford prompted California’s assembly to pass a new mandatory minimum law increasing sentences for sex offenders. That’s something certain sexual assault activists would embrace, but it furthers the cycle of   sentences imposed in reaction to widely publicized crimes. That cycle, in the ’80s and ’90s, left us with mass incarceration.      It would have been simple for SVU to react to this trend by embracing carceral feminism. It’s a cop show; it’s about catching and putting away bad guys. It doesn’t face the same pressures for nuance that analysts writing think pieces or conducting advocacy campaigns do. Why not exploit greater awareness and interest in sexual assault issues by locking up more rapists? But the show, pointedly, refused to go that route. Instead, the ’10s featured a remarkable pivot in which SVU suddenly took police racial bias and mass incarceration seriously.    Of course, this being SVU, it went about this transition in an    occasionally   way. The season 14 episode ”Monster’s Legacy” was, on paper, an excellent step forward. Featuring Andre Braugher’s character Bayard Ellis, a civil rights attorney whose presence gives the show an opportunity to look critically at law enforcement, it centers on a death row inmate whom Benson and Ellis attempt to save from execution. They learn that the inmate had been repeatedly sexually abused as a child, and that his murder victim wasn’t a stranger, as the prosecution had alleged, but a much older man who’d paid him for sex and had   him the night before the murder with three other men. At no point in the episode is the inmate’s guilt in question. No one even questions that he should be in prison. The contention is merely that the jury should’ve heard about these mitigating circumstances, which might have spared him a death sentence. This is an unusually nuanced position for a cop procedural to take, and it’s especially striking to see a heroic detective figure like Benson take on the cause of an admitted murderer, because even violent criminals deserve fair treatment. The problem was that, in a bit of unfortunate stunt casting, the inmate was played by Mike Tyson, who served three years in prison for rape. The show’s writers attempted to defend SVU casting a convicted rapist by insisting that Tyson had served his time, but given that Tyson has never admitted to or expressed any remorse for his crime, his presence on a show that rape survivors champion as an ally was jarring.             Soapier, but more defensible, was season 15’s ”American Tragedy.” The plot can be summarized as ”Paula Deen kills Trayvon Martin,” which is not exactly a promising premise. But where much of the media coverage surrounding Martin’s killing dwelled on the ambiguities  —   did his killer feel threatened? Was Martin really blameless?  —   SVU comes down unequivocally on the side of the    black boy whom Southern celebrity chef Jolene Castille (Cybill Shepherd) guns down. Initially, the police are sympathetic to Castille. The boy she shot was a suspect in a string of rapes; she claims he was trying to rape her as well. The boy’s parents painfully and movingly insist to the detectives that their son couldn’t have done such a thing, that the detectives need to investigate his killing seriously, but the detectives remain skeptical. Then another suspect is found to have committed the serial rapes. Castille’s victim was totally innocent. What’s more, Castille lies about how close he was when she shot him, embellishes her story with details about the real rapist’s MO that she heard on the news, and turns out to have a long record of making racist comments to staff and acquaintances. ”If it was a white boy, I wouldn’t have been afraid,” she tells the jury.    In SVU’s version of the Trayvon Martin story, the key problem is racial bias, white fear of young black men, and the police’s excessive willingness to accept young black men’s guilt without evidence. Even sex offenders are people  —   and have families             But the most striking shift in SVU can be seen in episodes where it refuses to demonize even characters suspected of heinous sex crimes. That’s a risky thing to do without sacrificing the show’s reputation as a bulwark for victims. But the show pulled it off. The shift began tepidly with season 16’s ”Perverted Justice.” Again featuring Andre Braugher’s Bayard Ellis, it centers on Michelle Thompson (Samira Wiley of Orange Is the New Black and You’re the Worst) a young woman whose testimony as a    put her father in prison for rape and incest. As an adult, Thompson claims she lied to the police under pressure from her mother. The detectives and Ellis spend the entire episode attempting to have her father’s case reopened, to get a new trial where Michelle can testify that her accusation was false. The episode is based on a real case from New York state, but it deviates from the real facts in a way that undercuts the message somewhat. In the real incident, the daughter has been adamant and consistent in saying her father was innocent. In the episode, Michelle backtracks toward the end of the trial, telling Benson she honestly doesn’t remember what happened. This leads Benson to worry they freed the wrong man, and it feels like a bit of a  . The episode makes clear that there was reasonable doubt in the case. A man who was put away on flimsy evidence was set free. To have it end on an ambiguous note reeks of the show not wanting to side with a convicted sex offender. But by last season, the show had grown more confident and assured. The season’s most impressive episode, even more impressive than ”Sheltered Outcasts” (the one that sympathetically portrays convicted sex offenders who are attempting to atone) was ”Collateral Damages,” which features a recurring character (Deputy Police Commissioner Hank Abraham, played by Josh Pais) being arrested for possession of child pornography.    Prior to the episode, Abraham was hardly an audience favorite. A political hack rather than a career cop, he mostly played damage control for the department, advising detectives on PR strategy and how best to keep the NYPD’s image clean. He’s a smarmy, unlikable figure. But rather than portray his pedophilia as the cardinal sin underlying his general loathsomeness, the episode displays an astonishing amount of empathy. The episode reveals that Abraham is married to a far more popular recurring character: Pippa Cox (Jessica Phillips) a lawyer for social services who works with SVU on cases involving children. She and Abraham have two kids of their own. So the SVU detectives handle the case as sensitively as possible. They give Pippa and her kids a chance to quietly leave the house before press arrives; Benson gets them a hotel. At no point does the episode minimize Abraham’s crime; his protestations that he never hurt a child and merely looked at pictures come across as pathetic rationalizations. But it doesn’t turn Abraham into the worst villain possible, either. The investigation concludes that he really never did hurt a child, and treated his own children well. The main focus, though, is on Pippa, her processing of the crime, and what a revelation like this does to a family. This is a tricky focus to choose, given the risk of painting the perp’s family as the real victims, to the exclusion of the children Abraham victimized. But the family’s pain is real, too, and SVU’s attention to it served only to amplify the gravity of the crimes in question and show how they rip apart everyone touched by them. ”My mother, she’s blaming me,” Pippa laments to Benson, sobbing. ”’How could you not suspect him? You do this for a living.’   …     I married him. I slept with him for 12 years.   …     How blind am I? How stupid?” In the end, when Pippa decides to stay with her husband, her choice is not portrayed as weak or cowardly. It’s painted as an understandable decision of a woman in a completely impossible position. ”He’s still my husband. We have two children,” she tells Benson, who replies, ”I get it. I get it.” ”It is our problem”             ”How many people have we put away for this?” Benson ponders at one point in ”Collateral Damages,” after having caught Abraham with child pornography. ”Not once have I ever had sympathy for any of them.” ADA Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza) replies glibly, ”It’s not our problem.” Benson stares at him accusingly. ”It is our problem,” he admits.    This is the exact reversal that SVU has made as a show over the past five or so years. In its original incarnation, sympathy for the perpetrator was not its problem. It did not concern itself with what happened to its villains. They could be raped in prison or driven mad in supermax for all the detectives and prosecutors cared. But the show eventually realized this was its problem. Partly this was a matter of  . SVU appeals to Democrats more than just about any other cop show, and with that party showing the strongest movement on criminal justice, it made sense for the show to liberalize in turn. However, the change also took real courage. The level of sympathy that public opinion has started to extend to drug offenders and even   property and violent criminals often does not apply to sex offenders. Light sentencing, as in the case of Brock Turner, prompts public outrage even when the defendant is actually convicted. It would’ve been very possible for SVU to exhibit more sympathy to   offenders and maintain a harsh line on its traditional villains. SVU tracked America’s movement on crime issues, but in the process it became a better, more nuanced, and more powerful show. It’s still a tabloid procedural at heart. It will always be titillating and sensationalistic. But at its best, it displays a profound empathy that’s lacking in most other shows of its ilk. At first, that empathy was extended only to victims. Now it extends to just about everyone the criminal justice system touches. ",-1.0
"‘I’ll take you home’: Vet reunites with his military dog. YORK, Pa.  —   One reunion down, hundreds more to go. On Saturday, Army veteran Julio Muñoz finally found the dog he has been missing for three years  —   Ben, the canine who fought alongside him in Afghanistan. Muñoz, 32, of The Bronx, was supposed to have been given the chance to adopt the dog after deployment. But as   at least two Pentagon employees, along with contractor K2 Solutions, have been secretly dumping military dogs out to civilians instead of offering them to their handlers. Kim Scarborough, 52, was one of those civilians. She found Muñoz’s name on Ben’s deployment papers. She had told The Post after reaching out to the soldier, “If the handler wants Ben, it belongs to him. Period, the end. ” Though Muñoz missed Ben fiercely, the   said if the dog was happy in his new home, he’d let him be. “I wouldn’t want to ruin that for him,” Muñoz said. “He’s already been through so much. ” Scarborough and Muñoz agreed to meet, and the anxiety was palpable. Muñoz was afraid Ben wouldn’t remember him; Scarborough feared Ben would abandon her. Bounding out of Scarborough’s car toward Muñoz, Ben was overwhelmed, running back and forth between the two. Soon, he settled, and took to Muñoz’s daughter, Mia, 5, and    son, Ethan. It quickly became clear that Muñoz was Ben’s master. “Loose!” he would say, and Ben would drop what was in his mouth. “Oh, so that’s how you get him to do that,” Scarborough said. Questions followed: Why did Ben respond to German? He had been trained in Germany. Why are tennis balls his favorite toy? Muñoz trained him with tennis balls, using them as rewards. Why was Ben so good with kids? He was a fighter, Muñoz explained, but always sweet, comforting soldiers when they were stressed out. As the two talked, Muñoz’s wife, Sully, looked on from a distance. She didn’t know whether her husband could bring himself to take the dog, even though he so badly wanted to. “He called me from Afghanistan once and said, ‘Are you praying for me?’ ” she recalled. “I told him, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘Ben found an IED. It didn’t go off.’ That had happened before, but this was different. ” A tear rolled down her cheek. “I don’t like to talk too much about what happened overseas,” Muñoz said. “But we made contact with some bad guys, and I had to tie Ben back for his own safety. I went back to the hole to start shooting, and Ben chewed through his leash and laid right down next to me. ” After a little over an hour, Ben was in thrall to Muñoz’s family, chasing a tennis ball tossed by Mia and nestling it under Ethan’s arm. “Julio,” Scarborough said softly, “why don’t you take the dog home?” Muñoz paused, staring at Ben. “He’s happy with you,” he said, trying to contain his emotions. “I don’t want to take that away from him. ” “I didn’t go to war with him,” Scarborough said. “It’s different. ” “That’s all right,” Muñoz said. “We have some good memories. He’s a fighter. He never gives up. ” Scarborough was silent for a few moments, but said, “I think he needs to take Ben home,” and walked to her car to gather Ben’s things. “Julio,” his wife said, “you want to take the dog home?” By now, Muñoz’s face was flushed, his eyes teary. “He’s done so much, been through so many things. I don’t want to take him home,” he said. He looked at Ben, who looked right back. “Come on,” Muñoz told him. “I’ll take you home. ”",1.0
"‘The whole chessboard’: A new document reveals Donald Trump’s economic strategy in detail.          Donald Trump would pull the United States out of the World Trade Organization if necessary to help American companies sell more abroad. He thinks that he can close the United States’ $500 billion trade deficit within two years by renegotiating trade deals. And he sees this new approach to trade as the key complement to a bevy of traditional Republican policies  —   tax cuts, energy drilling and deregulation  —   that will supercharge the economy, according to a new campaign analysis that lays out the Republican candidate’s economic strategy in the most detail yet. It is an unusually ideologically scattered plan for a   presidential nominee. It is a tapestry of   conservatism and liberal populism. It promises to free American companies to compete more successfully on the world stage and to force America’s top trading partners into submission. Perhaps paradoxically, it also claims that those trading partners will be better off for bowing to Trump’s demands. The plan’s guiding theory is that the U. S. economy is growing slowly because past presidents in the globalization era haven’t even tried to level the   playing field in America’s favor.      Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said during a speech on the economy on Sept. 15 in New York that policies of ”globalism” have resulted in job losses in the U. S. (Peter   Washington Post)   A new,   analysis of Trump’s economic proposals, penned by two of his senior policy advisers and issued Sunday evening by Trump’s campaign, provides the most detailed look yet into how Trump envisions his economic plan boosting growth, wages and wealth  —   through policies that together defy partisan convention. It demonstrates, in quantifiable terms, that trade policy is as important to Trump’s economic promises as tax cuts  —   and that if he fails to change the terms of globalization, he will face a huge budget shortfall. One of its authors, a University of California at Irvine economist named Peter Navarro, describes the paper, titled ”Scoring the Trump Economic Plan: Trade, Regulatory, & Energy Policy Impacts,” as simply ”the whole chessboard.” It is sure to draw fire from business groups and liberals alike  —   for often different reasons. The advisers think Trump’s plan will boost U. S. annual economic growth from an average of 2 percent, as many forecasters expect, to an average of 3. 5 percent, creating millions of additional jobs in the process. They also think that, coupled with spending cuts, the plan will generate additional tax revenue that will make up for all the revenue lost from his tax cuts  —   between $4. 4 and $5. 9 trillion, by one analysis  —   meaning that the plan would not add to the deficit. The independent Center for a Responsible Federal Budget disagrees with that assessment, projecting Trump would in total add $5. 3 trillion to the national debt; its analysis did not account for any higher growth from the plan. Trump’s advisers project that he will spur $1. 74 trillion in new revenue over a decade from the economic growth generated by trade policy. (The independent Tax Foundation predicts the added growth from his tax cuts will spur about that much, as well.) Trump advisers also project $580 billion in new tax revenue from reducing federal regulations and $150 billion from increased   exploration. The plan includes much of a traditional conservative ”competitiveness” agenda. Trump would slash corporate tax rates, reduce regulatory burdens and seek to push down energy costs. Each of those proposals has critics in the economics profession; for example, eliminating a Wall Street regulation might reduce compliance costs and free up more money for investment, but it might also increase the odds of a future   financial crisis. But Trump’s team says it also wants to address what it calls the ”push” of American jobs, and particularly manufacturing, to foreign countries. Where Trump departs from George W. Bush and traditional   conservatives is his focus on what Navarro and his   private equity investor Wilbur Ross, call the ”pull” of international trade agreements and unfair   practices on those companies. Reducing the ”pull” is the most critical piece of the Trump economic agenda. Ross and Navarro contend that Trump could do this in a year or two by renegotiating trade deals and other steps. Those include convincing the World Trade Organization to change rules that advantages exports from countries that rely heavily on what essentially are national sales taxes, such as Mexico and Germany, at the expense of countries that rely more on income taxes, such as the United States. At points, the analysis details how such change would come about. It says Trump would impose tariffs if necessary against countries that violate trade norms. It raises the possibility of the United States pulling out of the WTO, the governing body of globalization, to force the WTO to change the taxation rule to America’s advantage. ”Without the US as a member, there would not be much purpose to the WTO,” the analysis says, ”but prior occupants in the White House have been unwilling to lead on this issue.” At other times, the analysis simply states as fact Trump’s ability to force other countries to renegotiate existing trade agreements with the United States: ”South Korea will have no grounds to complain when Trump calls for a renegotiation. The two parties will simply seek a far more equitable deal.” In an interview, Navarro cast those renegotiations as an essential piece of the competitiveness puzzle for U. S. corporations. He said key trading partners, including Germany, Mexico and Japan, will respond quickly to Trump’s toughness as a negotiator and his seriousness on the issue. “They depend on us more than we depend on them,” Navarro said of the trading partners. ”They’re the ones running the surpluses. They have a lot more to lose than we do. ” Later, he predicted the Chinese would end ”cheating” practices on trade: “Donald Trump comes into the White House, they will perceive strength, and they will understand that it’s in their best interest to make a better deal and move forward with relations. ” Many trade officials from the Bush and Obama administrations would dispute that point, as would many economists. In the analysis and the interview, Navarro played down the possibility that Trump’s trade efforts might backfire, producing an escalating set of tariffs between countries that slow global trade, and growth, dramatically. Several analysts have warned of that possibility, and millions of potential lost jobs, in models of his economic plans. Navarro stressed the opposite: that the bigger risk is doing nothing, and allowing large trade deficits to continue. He said the best reason to think that Trump will succeed is the likelihood that other countries will see an advantage in accommodating him. America’s trade deficit, the Trump team argues, has unbalanced the global economy and held back growth. Eliminating it will end the current era of   advanced economies and unleash new prosperity for the world. The Trump economic doctrine, then, would not be about winning against the rest of the world. It would be the whole world, winning together, by doing what Trump knows is best.",-0.5
"New ACS chief takes The Post’s advice. At least one member of Team de Blasio is willing to take our advice: David Hansell, the new Administration for Children’s Services chief,  .

"Prison worker facing charges after mop closet sex with inmate leads to pregnancy. A female prison worker from Indiana faces felony charges after she allegedly became pregnant with an inmate’s child. Army Sgt. Heater Sinnett, 27, has been charged with sexual misconduct for her alleged relationship with Brad Gullege, who is serving time at Edinburgh Correctional Facility for drug offenses. Sinnett would escort and supervise inmates as part of her duties, which was how she met Gullege last year,  . Gullege told authorities that the two were getting ice in October 2016 when they had sex in a mop closet. Investigators said the pair discussed the sexual encounter in phone call, with Gullege claiming the sex was “hurried and brief. ” But Sinnett said “it was enough” to get her pregnant,  . Sinnett informed the Army that she was pregnant on Dec. 12, but refused to answer questions from investigators. “People place great trust in people who oversee and supervise IDOC inmates and anytime somebody betrays that trust or takes advantage of it for their own personal satisfaction  …     it is very serious,” Johnson County Deputy Prosecutor Alex Hamner told WXIN. If convicted, Sinnett could spend up to six years behind bars.",1.0
"Video of Orlando attack shows shooter firing at those already wounded.  Surveillance footage from inside an Orlando club the night of a rampage there shows Omar Mateen firing at people, stopping and then shooting again those who were already wounded, said officials who have viewed the evidence. The video suggests that “he was making sure anybody who was shot was dead,” said one official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. The footage corroborates witness accounts that Mateen quickly emptied a   magazine and then reloaded, proceeding to fire another 30 rounds into the wounded sprawled in front of him. The video of the attack has become a key piece of evidence as officials try to determine what happened in the early morning hours of June 12. The FBI declined to comment. Witness accounts indicate that Mateen killed most of his victims during the initial minutes of the massacre. He was using a Sig Sauer MCX rifle firing .  ammunition at a muzzle velocity of about 3, 200 feet per second. And he was a trained shooter from his time as a student at a police academy.   People who knew Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen describe him as a man who had many demons and potentially led a double life. (Erin Patrick O’Connor, Jayne Orenstein, Thomas   Washington Post)    [‘I grabbed my assault rifle and ran’: An officer’s account of the critical early minutes in Orlando]  On the Saturday night before the shooting, before leaving his home, Mateen told his wife he was going to see an old friend nicknamed Nemo, said officials and others familiar with the case. He then drove to Orlando. Officials said that Mateen got an entry wristband for Pulse nightclub, went inside and then left. He later returned and began his rampage. In recent days, the Orlando Police Department has faced tough questions about its officers’ actions during their   standoff with Mateen at Pulse. Some inside the club have wondered, for example, whether police should have moved more quickly to confront the gunman, and whether any of those who were gravely wounded inside the club died because rescuers were unable to reach them. Mateen told authorities that he had a vehicle outside with bombs and a vest like the kind “used in France. ” Officials on the scene took the threat of explosives seriously. During a news conference this week, authorities repeatedly defended their response at the club. The officers who arrived that night “should not be ” U. S. Attorney A. Lee Bentley III said. “They performed valiantly during those early morning hours. Lives were saved because of their heroic work. ”  [What the Orlando gunman told the police during his rampage]  Investigators are still filling in a timeline of the evening’s events, which were often marked by confusion about the shooter’s intentions.     Casualties of America’s worst mass shooting View Graphic     Casualties of America’s worst mass shooting  An officer working security   at the club first exchanged gunfire with Mateen shortly after 2 a. m. and by 2:08 a. m. more officers were rushing in for another confrontation. One officer who arrived at the scene said that he and others went into the club but did not see Mateen, who appeared to be holed up in the restroom area. The officers were told to hold their positions, aiming their rifles toward the restrooms, said Officer Brandon Cornwell, and they waited “15 or 20 minutes  —   could’ve been longer” for a SWAT team to arrive. Officials have said that at 2:35 a. m. Mateen called 911 from a restroom where he had apparently taken hostages. Authorities tried to take whatever victims they could out of the club  —   from a patio, the dance floor and dressing rooms  —   and began negotiating with Mateen, officials have said. Those talks broke down just after 5 a. m. about the time that Mateen threatened to strap hostages with explosives and send them from the restroom area out into the club, authorities have said.  [Orlando shooter posted messages on Facebook pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS and vowing more attacks]  The final confrontation was perhaps the most chaotic. Authorities detonated an explosive charge to breach the wall to the restrooms, but it did not create an opening as intended, Mark Canty, the Orlando Police Department’s SWAT commander, has said. Police then used an armored vehicle to ram a hole, which turned out to be between two of the club’s restrooms, he said. Canty said that Mateen was in the north of those restrooms and that officers created another hole in the south restroom so that hostages could escape. Mateen, he said, soon emerged from the other hole  —   between the two restrooms  —   where he was fatally shot in a final gun battle with police.  Orlando Police Chief John W. Mina said at a news conference Monday that he thinks “there was this misconception that we didn’t do anything for three hours,” and he emphasized that police officers were continuing to work, an effort that included heading back into the club to rescue people. He declined to say whether officers had inadvertently wounded patrons in the club during the encounter but said Mateen bore responsibility for what transpired. “That’s all part of the investigation, but here’s what I will tell you: Those killings are on the suspect and the suspect alone, in my mind,” Mina said. Dorian Wayne, who was in the club that night, said that he thinks police “could have run in and shot” Mateen, but that he is sympathetic to the tough decisions law enforcement officials had to make. “I feel for the people who were in there and didn’t get the proper help that they needed,” Wayne said. “But at the same time, I understand the cops  —   they’re human. ”  Thomas   contributed to this report.

"At the French Open, Serena Williams Is a Study in Motion. Serena Williams descended upon the clay courts of the French Open in Paris this week, where a year ago she became a lodestar of ridiculous controversy. In one early bout, Williams' decision to wear a black catsuit resulted in a violation; the form of dress has since been banned by the French Tennis Federation. ""The combination of Serena this year, for example, it will no longer be accepted,"" FTF President Bernard Giudicelli told Tennis magazine. ""You have to respect the game and the place."" The press praised the outfit. Fans loved it.

"Jay Bilas’ off-the-wall claim that athletes benefit from campus life. ESPN’s Jay Bilas, who plays a college sports expert on TV, once said a most remarkable thing. Given to lecturing, Bilas declared that even if recruited   don’t attend classes  —   in other words, if academic fraud is committed  —   athletes still benefit from the socialization process they undergo by being in a college environment. He sounded serious. He always does. Even if such a pathetic rationalization were true occasionally, there is a growing preponderance of evidence to the contrary. Full scholarship recruits are leaving college in far worse social condition than when they arrived. Aaron Hernandez, now dead by   suicide, was recruited from his home in Connecticut by a full scholarship to the University of Florida, a tough school for      to be admitted. He then left Florida for the NFL  —   and to become a   murderer. What did that mean to Florida? Nothing. Not even a   cautionary tale or even a modicum of shame and an active desire to do better. Many, and perhaps most,   basketball and football colleges, long before Hernandez and well after him, remain institutions of higher learning that will recruit  —   beg  —   anyone who can help win a ballgame to roam their campuses. Hernandez left Florida for the NFL after the 2010 season. He was indicted for murder in 2013, convicted in 2015  —   while Florida football and basketball remained a warehouse for    . A 2015 ESPN “Outside the Lines” investigation found that Florida’s football and men’s basketball programs had 80 players named as suspects in more than 100 crimes from  . Recently and locally, Janoris Jenkins, with the Giants, was arrested three times while at Florida. His Florida socialization process was on display last season when he tweeted   obscenities to and about Browns receiver Terrelle Pryor. Will Hill played defensive back for Florida but went undrafted as a   risk. He played for the Giants and Ravens, but finally was dumped after three drug suspensions and two arrests for failure to pay child support. Jermaine Cunningham was a Florida linebacker, and briefly was on the Jets. At Florida he was arrested for a hassle in a restaurant then suspended by the NFL for drug use. In 2015, as part of a plea deal, he admitted in court to posting pornographic pictures of his girlfriend on Instagram. Florida is a member of the SEC, which two years ago instituted mandatory seminars to discourage football recruits from assaulting women, given that previous recruits arrived on campus with no idea. Such seminars are too late for Baylor football, one of it its   recruits already convicted of rape in 2014, with 52 more rape accusations to go. And in the same week Hernandez reportedly offed himself, Adam “Pacman” Jones again made news as a recidivist, irreversible creep who impossibly remains in the employ of a pro team, the Cincinnati Bailbonds of the Nero Fiddles League. From the day he left West Virginia  —   another top producer of criminal    —   Jones has served the NFL as a parole model. Soon the NFL will have a team in Las Vegas. It was there, while attending NBA   weekend, that Jones’ crew left three people shot, including a strip club bouncer who was paralyzed. Identified as the instigator, Jones was ordered by a court to pay $12 million in damages and was suspended from the NFL for a season. At West Virginia, Jones underwent his socialization process with teammate Chris Henry  —   who, as a receiver with the Bengals, was arrested six times before he was killed, falling from a truck following an argument with his girlfriend. So the       campus socialization process Bilas preached as plenty good enough, should provide all with continuing encouragement and comfort. TV and radio voices must cease looking at failures to run to first base as selective cases. Baseball, at its   level for players  —   and   level for fans  —   is suffering an epidemic: running to first, the least a player can do, has become optional. Tuesday on YES, Michael Kay tried to stress what couldn’t be missed: The Yankees passed on an opportunity to perform an easy triple play. That’s right, an easy triple play. Up   in the top of the eighth, the White Sox had runners on first and second, none out, when Jose Abreu, a    pro, tried to bunt. He popped it up in front of the plate then immediately surrendered. Heading back to the dugout, Abreu nearly collided with catcher Austin Romine, who was advancing a couple of feet into fair territory to catch the pop. With both runners headed back to their base, Romine merely had to let the ball drop to start a triple play. But he caught it. The next batter, Avisail Garcia, hit a   homer, and the Yanks lost,  . But when Kay asked analyst Al Leiter why the Yanks hadn’t attempted a triple or at least a double play, Leiter said it happened too fast to even consider, which was nonsense. Kay tried again. Nothing, again. That Abreu didn’t bother to run was the trigger issue. He begged to be humiliated by not running into a triple play. This was the game’s Waterloo, yet it was dismissed. Tuesday on SNY, Gary Cohen and Ron Darling made   at the Phillies’ Freddy Galvis for what has been ignored frequently on SNY when enacted by Yoenis Cespedes. With the Phils down to the Mets,   Cohen and Darling scolded Galvis for not running out a high, infield fly that was dropped by Jose Reyes. They correctly said Galvis belonged on second instead of first. SNY showed Galvis jogging a few steps, stopping to watch, then jogging to first, as Darling moaned his added disapproval.  The next night, Cohen said Galvis had admitted that   error. “I was tough on him, last night,” said Darling, “but he’ll never do that again. ” Wanna bet? If everyone, starting in the minors or wherever, ran to first after learning their lesson the hard way  —   and for the first time  —   not running to first wouldn’t be a Major League Baseball epidemic! Question of the Weak: Monday, Matt Holliday hit a third inning,   homer against the White Sox in the Yankees’   win. Afterwards, YES’ Meredith Marakovits asked him this: “Derek Holland threw you a pitch,   count, up in the zone.   …     At what point did you realize that’s a pitch you could really drive?” Holliday was kind. He said it all happened kind of fast.",1.0

"A Family’s Race to Cure a Daughter’s Genetic Disease. One July afternoon last summer, Matt Wilsey distributed small plastic tubes to 60 people gathered in a Palo Alto, California, hotel. Most of them had traveled thousands of miles to be here; now, each popped the top off a barcoded tube, spat in about half a teaspoon of saliva, and closed the tube. Some massaged their cheeks to produce enough spit to fill the tubes. Others couldn’t spit, so a technician rolled individual cotton swabs along the insides of their cheeks, harvesting their skin cells—and the valuable DNA inside. One of the donors was Asger Vigeholm, a Danish business developer who had traveled from Copenhagen to be here, in a nondescript lobby at the Palo Alto Hilton. Wilsey is not a doctor, and Vigeholm is not his patient. But they are united in a unique medical pursuit. Wilsey’s daughter, Grace, was one of the first children ever diagnosed with NGLY1 deficiency. It’s a genetic illness defined by a huge range of physical and mental disabilities: muscle weakness, liver problems, speech deficiencies, seizures. In 2016, Vigeholm’s son, Bertram, became the first child known to die from complications of the disease. Early one morning, as Bertram, age four, slept nestled between his parents, a respiratory infection claimed his life, leaving Vigeholm and his wife, Henriette, to mourn with their first son, Viktor. He, too, has NGLY1 deficiency. Grace and her mother, Kristen Wilsey. The night before the spit party, Vigeholm and Wilsey had gathered with members of 16 other families, eating pizza and drinking beer on the hotel patio as they got to know each other. All of them were related to one of the fewer than 50 children living in the world with NGLY1 deficiency. And all of them had been invited by the Wilseys—Matt and his wife Kristen, who in 2014 launched the Grace Science Foundation to study the disease. These families had met through an online support group, but this was the first time they had all come together in real life. Over the next few days in California, every family member would contribute his or her DNA and other biological samples to scientists researching the disease. On Friday and Saturday, 15 of these scientists described their contributions to the foundation; some studied the NGLY1 gene in tiny worms or flies, while others were copying NGLY1 deficient patients’ cells to examine how they behaved in the lab. Nobody knows what makes a single genetic mutation morph into all the symptoms Grace experiences. But the families and scientists were there to find out—and maybe even find a treatment for the disease. That search has been elusive. When scientists sequenced the first human genome in 2000, geneticist Francis Collins, a leader of the Human Genome Project that accomplished the feat, declared that it would lead to a “complete transformation in therapeutic medicine” by 2020. But the human genome turned out to be far more complex than scientists had anticipated. Most disorders, it’s now clear, are caused by a complicated mix of genetic faults and environmental factors. And even when a disease is caused by a defect in just one gene, like NGLY1 deficiency, fixing that defect is anything but simple. Scientists have tried for 30 years to perfect gene therapy, a method for replacing defective copies of genes with corrected ones. The first attempts used modified viruses to insert corrected genes into patients’ genomes. The idea appeared elegant on paper, but the first US gene therapy to treat an inherited disease—for blindness—was approved just last year. Now scientists are testing methods such as Crispr, which offers a far more precise way to edit DNA, to replace flawed genes with error-free ones. Certainly, the genetics revolution has made single-mutation diseases easier to identify; there are roughly 7,000, with dozens of new ones discovered each year. But if it’s hard to find a treatment for common genetic diseases, it’s all but impossible for the very rare ones. There’s no incentive for established companies to study them; the potential market is so small that a cure will never be profitable. Which is where the Wilseys—and the rest of the NGLY1 families—come in. Like a growing number of groups affected by rare genetic diseases, they’re leapfrogging pharmaceutical companies’ incentive structures, funding and organizing their own research in search of a cure. And they’re trying many of the same approaches that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have used for decades. At 10:30 on a recent Monday morning, Grace is in Spanish class. The delicate 8-year-old with wavy brown hair twisted back into a ponytail sits in her activity chair—a maneuverable kid-sized wheelchair. Her teacher passes out rectangular pieces of paper, instructing the students to make name tags. Grace grabs her paper and chews it. Her aide gently takes the paper from Grace’s mouth and puts it on Grace’s desk. The aide produces a plastic baggie of giant-sized crayons shaped like cylindrical blocks; they’re easier for Grace to hold than the standard Crayolas that her public school classmates are using. Grace's NGLY1 deficiency keeps her from speaking. At her school, a therapist helps her communicate. The other kids have written their names and are now decorating their name tags. “Are we allowed to draw zombies for the decorations?” one boy asks, as Grace mouths her crayons through the baggie. Grace’s aide selects a blue crayon, puts it in Grace’s hand, and closes her hand over Grace’s. She guides Grace’s hand, drawing letters on the paper: “G-R-A-C-E.” Grace lives with profound mental and physical disabilities. After she was born in 2009, her bewildering list of symptoms—weak muscles, difficulty eating, failure to thrive, liver damage, dry eyes, poor sleep—confounded every doctor she encountered. Grace didn’t toddle until she was three and still needs help using the toilet. She doesn’t speak and, like an infant, still grabs anything within arm’s reach and chews on it. Her father wants to help her. The grandson of a prominent San Francisco philanthropist and a successful technology executive, Matt Wilsey graduated from Stanford, where he became friends with a fellow undergraduate who would one day be Grace’s godmother: Chelsea Clinton. Wilsey went on to work in the Clinton White House, on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, and in the Pentagon. But it was his return to Silicon Valley that really prepared Wilsey for the challenge of his life. He worked in business development for startups, where he built small companies into multimillion-dollar firms. He negotiated a key deal between online retailer Zazzle and Disney, and later cofounded the online payments company Cardspring, where he brokered a pivotal deal with First Data, the largest payment processor in the world. He was chief revenue officer at Cardspring when four-year-old Grace was diagnosed as one of the first patients with NGLY1 deficiency in 2013—and when he learned there was no cure. At the time, scientists knew that the NGLY1 gene makes a protein called N-glycanase. But they had no idea how mistakes in the NGLY1 gene caused the bewildering array of symptoms seen in Grace and other kids with NGLY1 deficiency. Wilsey’s experience solving technology problems spurred him to ask scientists, doctors, venture capitalists, and other families what he could do to help Grace. Most advised him to start a foundation—a place to collect money for research that might lead to a cure for NGLY1 deficiency. As many as 30 percent of families who turn to genetic sequencing receive a diagnosis. But most rare diseases are new to science and medicine, and therefore largely untreatable. More than 250 small foundations are trying to fill this gap by sponsoring rare disease research. They’re funding scientists to make animals with the same genetic defects as their children so they can test potential cures. They’re getting patients’ genomes sequenced and sharing the results with hackers, crowdsourcing analysis of their data from global geeks. They’re making bespoke cancer treatments and starting for-profit businesses to work on finding cures for the diseases that affect them. “Start a foundation for NGLY1 research, get it up and running, and then move on with your life,” a friend told Wilsey. Wilsey heeded part of that advice but turned the rest of it on its head. In 2014, Wilsey left Cardspring just before it was acquired by Twitter and started the Grace Science Foundation to fund research into NGLY1 deficiency. The foundation has committed $7 million to research since then, most of it raised from the Wilseys’ personal network. Many other families with sick loved ones have started foundations, and some have succeeded. In 1991, for instance, a Texas boy named Ryan Dant was diagnosed with a fatal muscle-wasting disease called mucopolysaccharidosis type 1. His parents raised money to support an academic researcher who was working on a cure for MPS1; a company agreed to develop the drug, which became the first approved treatment for the disease in 2003. But unlike Dant, Grace had a completely new disease. Nobody was researching it. So Wilsey began cold-calling dozens of scientists, hoping to convince them to take a look at NGLY1 deficiency; if they agreed to meet, Wilsey read up on how their research might help his daughter. Eventually he recruited more than 100 leading scientists, including Nobel Prize-winning biologist Shinya Yamanaka and Carolyn Bertozzi, to figure out what was so important about N-glycanase. He knew that science was unpredictable and so distributed Grace Science’s funding through about 30 grants worth an average of $135,000 apiece. Two years later, one line of his massively parallel attack paid off. Matt Wilsey, Grace's father. Bertozzi, a world-leading chemist, studies enzymes that add and remove sugars from other proteins, fine-tuning their activity. N-glycanase does just that, ripping sugars off from other proteins. Our cells are not packed with the white, sweet stuff that you add to your coffee. But the tiny building blocks of molecules similar to table sugar can also attach themselves to proteins inside cells, acting like labels that tell the cell what to do with these proteins. Scientists thought that N-glycanase’s main role was to help recycle defective proteins, but many other enzymes are also involved in this process. Nobody understood why the loss of N-glycanase had such drastic impacts on NGLY1 kids. In 2016, Bertozzi had an idea. She thought N-glycanase might be more than just a bit player in the cell’s waste management system, so she decided to check whether it interacts with another protein that turns on the proteasomethe recycling machine within each of our cells. This protein is nicknamed Nerf, after its abbreviation, Nrf1. But fresh-made Nerf comes with a sugar attached to its end, and as long as that sugar sticks, Nerf doesn’t work. Some other protein has to chop the sugar off to turn on Nerf and activate the cellular recycling service. Think of Nerf’s sugar like the pin in a grenade: You have to remove the pin—or in this case, the sugar—to explode the grenade and break down faulty proteins. But nobody knew what protein was pulling the pin out of Nerf. Bertozzi wondered if N-glycanase might be doing that job. To find out, she first tested cells from mice and humans with and without working copies of the NGLY1 gene. The cells without NGLY1 weren’t able to remove Nerf’s sugar, but those with the enzyme did so easily. If Bertozzi added N-glycanase enzymes to cells without NGLY1, the cells began chopping off Nerf’s sugar just as they were supposed to: solid evidence, she thought, that N-glycanase and Nerf work together. N-glycanase pulls the pin (the sugar) out of the grenade (the Nerf protein) to trigger the explosion (boom). The finding opened new doors for NGLY1 disease research. It gave scientists the first real clue about how NGLY1 deficiency affects patients’ bodies: by profoundly disabling their ability to degrade cellular junk via the proteasome. As it turns out, the proteasome is also involved in a whole host of other diseases, such as cancer and brain disorders, that are far more common than NGLY1 deficiency. Wilsey immediately grasped the business implications: He had taken a moon shot, but he’d discovered something that could get him to Mars. Pharmaceutical companies had declined to work on NGLY1 deficiency because they couldn’t make money from a drug for such a rare disease. But Bertozzi had now linked NGLY1 deficiency to cancer and maladies such as Parkinson’s disease, through the proteasome—and cancer drugs are among the most profitable medicines. Suddenly, Wilsey realized that he could invent a new business model for rare diseases. Work on rare diseases, he could argue, could also enable therapies for more common—and therefore profitable—conditions. In early 2017, Wilsey put together a slide deck—the same kind he’d used to convince investors to fund his tech startups. Only this time, he wanted to start a biotechnology company focused on curing diseases linked to NGLY1. Others had done this before, such as John Crowley, who started a small biotechnology company that developed the first treatment for Pompe disease, which two of his children have. But few have been able to link their rare diseases to broader medical interests in the way that Wilsey hoped to. He decided to build a company that makes treatments for both rare and common diseases involving NGLY1. Curing NGLY1 disease would be to this company as search is to Google—the big problem it was trying to solve, its reason for existence. Treating cancer would be like Google’s targeted advertising—the revenue stream that would help the company get there. But his idea had its skeptics, Wilsey’s friends among them. One, a biotechnology investor named Kush Parmar, told Wilsey about some major obstacles to developing a treatment for NGLY1 deficiency. Wilsey was thinking of using approaches such as gene therapy to deliver corrected NGLY1 genes into kids, or enzyme replacement therapy, to infuse kids with the N-glycanase enzyme they couldn’t make on their own. But NGLY1 deficiency seems particularly damaging to cells in the brain and central nervous system, Parmar pointed out—places that are notoriously inaccessible to drugs. It’s hard to cure a disease if you can’t deliver the treatment to the right place. Other friends warned Wilsey that most biotech startups fail. And even if his did succeed as a company, it might not achieve the goals that he wanted it to. Ken Drazan, president of the cancer diagnostics company Grail, is on the board of directors of Wilsey’s foundation. Drazan warned Wilsey that his company might be pulled away from NGLY1 deficiency. “If you take people’s capital, then you have to be open to wherever that product development takes you,” Drazan said. But Wilsey did have some things going for him. Biotechnology companies have become interested of late in studying rare diseases—ones like the type of blindness for which the gene therapy was approved last year. If these treatments represent true cures, they can command a very high price. Still, the newly approved gene therapy for blindness may be used in 6,000 people, 100 times more than could be helped by an NGLY1 deficiency cure. Wilsey asked dozens of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies if they would work on NGLY1 deficiency. Only one, Takeda, Japan’s largest drug company, agreed to conduct substantial early-stage research on the illness. Others turned him down flat. If no one else was going to develop a drug to treat NGLY1 deficiency, Wilsey, decided, he might as well try. “We have one shot at this,” he says. “Especially if your science is good enough, why not go for it?” “Matt was showing classic entrepreneurial tendencies,” says Dan Levy, the vice president for small business at Facebook, who has known Wilsey since they rushed the same Stanford fraternity in the 1990s. “You have to suspend a little bit of disbelief, because everything is stacked against you.” At 11 am, Grace sits in a classroom with a speech therapist. Though Grace doesn’t speak, she’s learning to use her “talker,” a tablet-sized device with icons that help her communicate. Grace grabs her talker and presses the icons for “play” and “music,” then presses a button to make her talker read the words out loud. The ""talker"" used for Grace's therapy. “OK, play music,” her therapist says, starting up a nearby iPad. Grace watches an Elmo video on the iPad for a few moments, her forehead crinkled in concentration, her huge brown eyes a carbon copy of her dad’s. Then Grace stops the video and searches for another song. Suddenly, her therapist slides the iPad out of Grace’s reach. “You want ‘Slippery Fish,’” her therapist says. “I want you to tell me that.” Grace turns to her talker: “Play music,” she types again. The therapist attempts one more time to help Grace say more clearly which particular song she wants. Instead, Grace selects the symbols for two new words. “Feel mad,” Grace’s talker declares. Grace working with a therapist in one of their therapy rooms. There’s no denying how frustrating it can be for Grace to rely on other people to do everything for her, and how hard her family works to meet her constant needs. Matt and Kristen can provide the therapy, equipment, medicines, and around-the-clock supervision that Grace needs to have a stable life. But that is not enough—not for Grace, who wants ""Slippery Fish,"" nor for her parents, who want a cure. So last summer, Wilsey raised money to bring the Vigeholms and the other NGLY1 families to Palo Alto, where they met with Grace’s doctors and the Grace Science Foundation researchers. One Japanese scientist, Takayuki Kamei, was overjoyed to meet two of the NGLY1 deficiency patients: “I say hello to their cells every morning,” he told their parents. And because all of these families also want a cure, each also donated blood, skin, spit, stool, and urine to the world’s first NGLY1 deficiency biobank. In four days, scientists collected more NGLY1 deficiency data than had been collected in the entire five years since the disease was discovered. These patient samples, now stored at Stanford University and at Rutgers University, have been divvied up into more than 5,000 individual samples that will be distributed to academic and company researchers who wish to work on NGLY1 deficiency. That same month, Wilsey closed a seed round of $7 million to start Grace Science LLC. His main backer, a veteran private equity investor, prefers not to be named. Like many in Silicon Valley, he’s recently become attracted to health care by the promise of a so-called “double bottom line”: the potential to both to make money and to do good by saving lives. Wilsey is chief executive of the company and heavily involved in its scientific strategy. He’s looking for a head scientist with experience in gene therapy and in enzyme replacement therapy, which Mark Dant and John Crowley used to treat their sick children. Gene therapy now seems poised to take off after years of false starts; candidate cures for blood and nervous system disorders are speeding through clinical trials, and companies that use Crispr have raised more than $1 billion. Wilsey doesn’t know which of these strategies, if any, will save Grace. But he hopes his company will find an NGLY1 deficiency cure within five years. The oldest known NGLY1 deficient patient is in her 20s, but since nobody has been looking for these patients until now, it’s impossible to know how many others—like Bertram—didn’t make it that long. “We don’t know what Grace’s lifespan is,” Wilsey says. “We’re always waiting for the other shoe to drop.” But at 3 pm on this one November day, that doesn’t seem to matter. School’s out, and Grace is seated atop a light chestnut horse named Ned. Five staff members lead Grace through a session of equine therapy. Holding herself upright on Ned’s back helps Grace develop better core strength and coordination. Grace on her horse. Grace and Ned walk under a canopy of oak trees. Her face is serene, her usually restless legs still as Ned paces through late-afternoon sunshine. But for a little grace, there may be a cure for her yet. ",0.0

He beat his wife and he’s threatening to kill his self [sic]   …     He has a weapon   …     It’s a gun   …    ”   [A pastor’s disturbing message to his wife before killing his daughter and himself, police say]      South Carolina state Rep. Chris Corley (R). (Aiken County Sheriff’s Office)  Corley, of Graniteville, S. C. was arrested on Tuesday and charged with   domestic violence and pointing a firearm at a person, according to an online docket. He told investigators that he and his wife got into a fight because she suspected him of cheating. He said his wife tried to strike him in the face, but he pushed her away, according to the report. The    Republican lawmaker, who has a law office in Augusta, Ga. was elected to represent South Carolina’s 84th District in 2014. He was reelected without opposition this year. Corley’s arrest comes after a legislative session in which South Carolina lawmakers passed a sweeping reform bill that toughens punishments in domestic violence cases and bars offenders from possessing guns. In a December 2014 interview with the Aiken Standard, Corley, then newly elected, had some reservations about imposing a gun ban to solve domestic violence. “As far as what we can do as government, you know, stiffer mandatory penalties. I don’t know that saying you can’t have a gun because you get convicted of domestic violence, I don’t know if that’s going to stop someone from future domestic violence,” Corley said. But Corley voted to pass the bill, which includes a partial gun ban. Gov. Nikki Haley (R) signed it into law in June 2015. Online records show that Corley posted a $20, 000 bond shortly after his arrest. He was ordered to not contact his wife and was barred from handling a firearm, according to the Associated Press. The felony charges he’s facing carry a total of up to 15 years in prison. Corley is, perhaps, best known in South Carolina as the legislator who fiercely fought to keep the Confederate flag hoisted outside the statehouse.   [‘Intolerable’: Judge reprimanded after she ‘berated and belittled’   victim]   Lawmakers debated removing the flag last year in the aftermath of the massacre of nine parishioners inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a historically black church in Charleston, S. C. Among the victims was state Sen. Clementa Pinckney (D). This month, Dylann Roof was convicted of the murders. During the lengthy debate last year, Corley suggested replacing it with the white flag of surrender and held up a piece of paper taped to a pencil to illustrate his point, the AP reported. The flag was removed in July 2015, a month after the shooting. But Corley refused to give up the fight. He sponsored a bill that would allow voters to decide on whether to return the flag. The bill went nowhere, the AP reported. In December 2015, he sent out Christmas cards to his colleagues that featured a photo of the flag at the statehouse, according to the State. The card read: “May your Christmas be filled with memories of a happier time when South Carolina’s leaders possessed morals, convictions and the principles to stand for what is right   …     May you have a blessed Christmas, and may you take this joyous time as an opportunity to ask for forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal. ” He told the State that the card was a message to his fellow lawmakers who “betrayed the will of their constituents” by choosing political correctness.

Don’t go making backroom deals,” he told the paper. “You’ll have one group who gets the short end of the stick and make the side even more mad and hurt the goal of bringing all of South Carolina together. ” If indicted by a grand jury, Corley will be suspended from his legislative post. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Jay Lucas (R) told the Post and Courier that Lucas “will take the necessary action to comply with the law and maintain the dignity of the House of Representatives. ” Susan Selden, director of the Cumbee Center to Assist Abuse Persons in Aiken, S. C. called for Corley to resign. “It sets a bad example for him to remain as a legislator while he’s being investigated for this,” Selden told the Aiken Standard. It’s unclear who Corley’s lawyer is. According to the State, his attorney declined to comment and to give his name to reporters after a brief hearing on Tuesday.

"Madeleine Albright’s defense of Clinton’s foreign policy was weak on the merits.  Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is one of America’s most respected, most famous elder statespeople. So you’d think her speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention endorsing Hillary Clinton would be pretty compelling stuff.    But it wasn’t. And that should trouble Democrats. To get a flavor of the speech, just read this paragraph. Luxuriate in its mediocrity. Bathe in its clichés: When Hillary served as secretary of state, I watched her partner with President Obama to restore our country’s reputation around the world. She fought terrorism, she stopped the spread of nuclear weapons, and promoted diplomacy, defense, development and democracy  —   smart power    in every corner of the world. As I travel around the world today, I’m reminded how important it is that the person who represents our nation is trusted by our allies, and who listens more than she talks. What’s striking is that this is the only part of Albright’s short address that discussed Clinton’s time as America’s chief diplomat. If anyone could be expected to explain what Clinton actually did as secretary of state, it would be the last Democrat to have the job before her. Yet in the above paragraph, Albright didn’t name a single specific thing that Clinton did.    This is deeply weird.  The Republicans just spent the past week bashing Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state  —   blaming her for everything from the Benghazi attacks to the rise of ISIS to the Syrian civil war. Albright’s speech should have been the beginning of a   in which the Democrats start to make a strong case that Clinton actually made a real, positive impact on the big policy issues.    That didn’t happen, at all. Albright did praise Clinton’s judgment, listing off some anecdotes about their travels together while they were both in the Clinton White House. She also landed some solid hits on Donald Trump: “Many have argued that Donald would harm our national security if he were elected president. The fact is he has already done damage just by running for president. ” (Indeed, with one stray comment, Trump has already damaged the NATO alliance and made a war with Russia incrementally more likely.) But needling Trump on foreign policy and telling cute stories about eating cabbage in Prague isn’t the same thing as making a detailed case that Hillary Clinton actually has a proven record of success at foreign policy.     The Republicans had a coherent, if false, narrative about Clinton  —   she set the world on fire. Democrats need a better answer to that than what Madeleine Albright offered. We’ll see if they have one this week. ",-1.0
"Five myths about the FBI.   FBI Director James Comey’s 9.  political earthquake, announcing in a vague letter to Congress 11 days before the election that new evidence of unknown importance had surfaced in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server, has shined a bright light on the bureau’s unique role in Washington. Here are some myths about its culture and power.   Myth No. 1 The FBI isn’t political. One of J. Edgar Hoover’s first acts when he became director of the FBI in 1924 was to clean house of the bureau’s political appointees  —   and ever since, directors have proudly bragged that the FBI is completely nonpartisan. It’s simply a “  agency,” Hoover often promised. This summer, Comey himself assured that the Clinton server investigation had been conducted “in an entirely apolitical and professional way. ”  But while the FBI may technically be nonpartisan, it has long been one of the most politically astute institutions in the government. Its files have regularly been deployed as political weapons, from the 1948 election  —   in which Hoover backed Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman  —   to Watergate, where leaks from   Director Mark Felt helped bring down Richard Nixon. Moreover, the bureau spent much of the 20th century as something akin to America’s “morality police,” shifting resources decade by decade to combat perceived threats to the nation’s social fabric, from Harlem Renaissance authors in the 1930s to antiwar activists in the 1960s to “deadbeat dads” in the 1990s. During his   tenure, Hoover used the power of the traditionally conservative bureau to cozy up to powerful politicians and to bludgeon, publicly and privately, civil rights leaders, political dissidents, gays and especially communists.  Comey has made a point to try to stand against that era: FBI recruits visit the Holocaust Memorial Museum to understand, Comey has said, “in a palpable, nauseating and   way, the consequences of the abuse of power on a massive scale. ” He’s ordered new recruits to learn about the bureau’s history with the Rev. Martin Luther King, whom Hoover tried to blackmail into giving up his efforts. But the bureau (and particularly its director) retains a black belt in    political judo: It skillfully navigated the politics of the   Commission, halting a move to break it apart following its failure to prevent the Sept. 11 attacks. It uses its reputation for integrity, moral authority and justice to push presidents and lawmakers to back its programs and budget requests. Presidents know: You don’t want to be on your FBI director’s bad side. Myth No. 2 The FBI director can’t be ﬁred. While many national security roles, such as CIA director, typically turn over at the beginning of a presidential term, the FBI directorship over the past 40 years has been seen as an apolitical post. Ever since    Hoover died in May 1972, FBI chiefs have been appointed to a congressionally mandated, nonrenewable   term. When Comey’s predecessor, Robert Mueller, reached the end of that term, President Obama asked him to stay an additional two years  —   a move that required a special act of Congress.  But that fixed term doesn’t limit how or why a president can remove an FBI director, and, according to U. S. law, a firing doesn’t have to be “for cause. ” When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Director William Sessions was already under siege for mismanagement. A scathing   inspector general report said he misused government transportation and engaged in other abuses of his office. Clinton, with the recommendation of Attorney General Janet Reno, fired Sessions outright after the director refused to resign.  Myth No. 3 The White House controls the FBI director. The FBI is part of the Justice Department, so technically the director reports up through the attorney general and to the White House itself  —   which is why this summer’s “social” meeting on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch raised alarms about whether they’d struck an “inside deal” not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. Similar questions were sparked by President Obama’s comments to “60 Minutes” that seemed to prejudge the investigation’s outcome, when he said that he didn’t think her server was a “national security problem. ”  But the FBI, which runs   and espionage investigations, operates with nearly unprecedented independence within the executive branch, especially when it comes to political inquiries. Past attorneys general have almost always deferred to the bureau  —   a habit that repeatedly rankled Reno during the 1990s, when Director Louis Freeh called their frequent battles “the   secret in Washington. ” Top Justice Department officials didn’t want Comey to inform Congress of the new Clinton inquest before the election, but he did it anyway. An FBI director’s perceived mantle of integrity can be a powerful bureaucratic weapon. In 2004, when Comey was deputy attorney general and provoked a showdown with the George W. Bush White House over the legality of the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance program, he enlisted the help of Mueller. Comey has said he knew that if he alone threatened to resign, he might fail, but if Mueller threatened to join him, the White House would be forced to revise the program. The gambit worked. Myth No. 4 The FBI had been trying to help Hillary Clinton. After Comey announced in July that the FBI didn’t think the former secretary of state had committed any crime with her email server, critics blasted him for letting her off the hook, GOP congressmen summoned him to the Hill to explain himself, and Donald Trump said the FBI was corrupt.  In fact, the bureau is decidedly not Clinton territory; a Guardian article this past week quoted an agent as saying it’s “Trumpland. ” Generally, in my reporting, I’ve found agents to be conservative, and there’s probably no political family in America with whom the bureau has had a worse relationship than the Clintons. The first        —   a   publishing genre  —   came from an FBI agent, Gary Aldrich, posted to the White House in the 1990s, who trashed the family in “Unlimited Access . ”  The relationship only went downhill from there. After firing Sessions, Bill Clinton appointed Freeh as his FBI director, calling him a “law enforcement legend,” only to see Freeh dedicate much of the rest of the 1990s to investigating him for scandals from Filegate to Whitewater to Monica Lewinsky. Freeh even gave back his White House visitor pass to ensure that no one thought he was too cozy with the president, and he told one reporter that he and Clinton didn’t speak for the final three years of the administration, a time when the threat of terrorism was rising around the world. The antipathy was mutual: According to Bob Woodward’s book “Shadow,” President Clinton used expletives to describe Freeh behind closed doors.  Myth No. 5 The new probe didn’t need to be revealed before the election. Numerous critics, including almost 100 former prosecutors, have argued that Comey  —   who announced that the bureau had begun looking into Clinton’s emails again less than two weeks before Election Day  —   should have tried harder not to affect the election. They pointed to Comey’s own argument that the United States shouldn’t accuse Russia of meddling in the election until officials were sure about what they’d found, and to Justice Department practices to keep mum about ongoing investigations.  According to his aides in multiple news reports this past week, Comey thought the news would probably have leaked anyway, making the bureau look even more like it was protecting Clinton. While most FBI offices are   and unlikely to hint of an unfolding investigation, the New York field office  —   the bureau’s largest and most powerful, and home to the investigation of Anthony Weiner that uncovered the new laptop  —   is notoriously leaky and hard for an FBI director to control. Field offices in general operate with a great deal of independence, able to adjust resources to respond to local threats or problems. But every FBI director has struggled in particular to control the New York office, one of just three sites  —   along with the Washington and Los Angeles offices  —   led by an assistant director. Agents in cities across the country worry about their cases leaking out of New York, they tell me. The 2009 Najibullah Zazi terrorism investigation, for instance, was worked quietly for days by the FBI in Denver, only to leak almost the moment Zazi arrived in New York to execute his attack.   garrett. graff@gmail. com   Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

"White House Favors a Light Touch in Regulating AI. The White House has issued principles for regulating the use of artificial intelligence that call for as little government interference as possible and offer only broad guidance to federal agencies. In fact, the principles might deter regulation of AI at a time when many think it is increasingly needed. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer of the United States, is set to announce the principles on Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. They arrive at a critical moment for the development of AI and for America’s position as the global standard bearer. The guidelines have the potential to shape the development of a broad swath of valuable and critical technologies, from autonomous vehicles to new medical imaging tools. They arrive amid growing worry over the unchecked spread of AI tools, especially facial recognition, and as other nations seek to establish their own norms around the technology, for example by building autonomous weapons or pervasive surveillance infrastructure. Some experts question whether the principles may be too vague to do much good. Ahead of the announcement, Kratsios told WIRED the guidelines are meant to  ensure that AI is developed safely, transparently, and in ways that reflect American principles. This is crucial, he says, when authoritarian rivals such as China and Russia are pursuing aggressive AI agendas of their own. “The values that we hold dear are baked into them,” Kratsios says. The principles state that when drawing up regulations, “federal agencies must consider fairness, non-discrimination, openness, transparency, safety, and security.” They also call for as little regulation as possible, with a “risk assessment and cost-benefit analyses” prior to any regulatory action. And they stipulate that any regulation must reflect “scientific evidence and feedback from the American public.” After a 90-day period for public input, agencies will have 180 days to come up with plans for implementing the principles. The White House apparently wants America alone to define the rules of the road when it comes to AI. The US has so far rejected working with other G7 nations on a project known as the Global Partnership on AI, which seeks to establish shared principles and regulations. Kratsios says he hopes other nations will follow America’s lead when developing their own regulations for AI. The White House has suggested that the G7 plan would stifle innovation with bureaucratic meddling. “The best way to counter authoritarian uses of AI is to make sure America and its international partners remain global hubs of innovation, advancing technology and manners consistent with our values,” Kratsios says. But some observers question how effective the principles will be. “A lot of this is open to interpretation to each individual agency,” says Martijn Rasser, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and the author of a recent report that calls for greater government investment in AI. “Anything that an agency produces could be shot down, given the vagueness,” Rasser says. “It would be easy for anyone to lobby against what’s proposed.” Rasser also says the US may have less influence if it insists on going alone. “It’s potentially worrying,” he says. “There’s a downside to us going down a different path to other nations.” The principles are just the latest US effort to shape AI globally, coming just days after the Commerce Department announced new export controls on US AI software. These rules, announced on Friday, prohibit US companies from selling “software specially designed to automate the analysis of geospatial imagery” outside the US except in Canada. AI algorithms are adept at interpreting aerial imagery, and the controls are meant to limit the ability of rivals such as China to use US software to develop military drones and satellites. But regulating the export of software is notoriously difficult, especially when many key algorithms and data sets are open source. The rise of AI has shaken up geopolitics. The US is locked in a new cold-war-esque race with China to harness critical technologies, including AI, for competitive ends. President Trump launched a national AI strategy in February 2019 with an executive order to establish the American Artificial Intelligence Initiative. Shortly after, the Pentagon set out a blueprint for developing and using the technology. The US government has also taken steps to curb China’s progress in AI, especially in areas where the technology could be used for weapons development, surveillance, or espionage. In October, the administration banned six Chinese AI companies from doing business with American firms for their role in supplying surveillance technology for use in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, where the authorities have imprisoned more than a million Muslims. A few months earlier, it placed Chinese companies responsible for developing supercomputing technology on the same list. In May, the Chinese tech giant Huawei was put on the blacklist, along with 70 affiliates, due to concerns over its ties to the government and the potential for its 5G wireless technology to be used for cyber espionage.",0.0
"The Iowa Caucus Debacle Leads This Week's Internet News Roundup. This last week, like many before it, was jam-packed with news. The coronavirus continued to spread; President Trump restricted New York residents from entering into trusted traveler programs; actor Kirk Douglas died; Jameela Jamil came out as queer. Also, Christina Koch returned to Earth after almost a year in space, and likely wants to go back into orbit. People are once again talking about Jessica Simpson, and we might be witnessing the start of the Billie Eilish backlash. These blips on the internet radar are just the beginning, however. Here's everything else people were talking about online over the past seven days. What happened: If the Iowa caucus for the Democratic presidential nominee is any indicator of what the rest of the election is going to be like, the road to November is going to be very, very long. What really happened: The 2020 election officially got underway Monday with the Iowa caucus, one of the earliest steps in the process to pick the person who will be the Democrats' nominee for president. You might be forgiven for wondering, as it only happens every two years, what exactly is the Iowa caucus? https://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin/status/1224381630392995844 Well, OK, sure, but is there a more descriptive take, perhaps? https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1224403915791392768 https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1224515740121944064 https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1224534136997785600 We're sensing a theme here. As is traditionally the case, there was a lot of attention placed on the caucus ahead of time, even as politicos shared their disdain for the process. But if the disdain ahead of the caucus seemed intense, just wait until things got underway for real. https://twitter.com/mviser/status/1224541817863053313 https://twitter.com/KatiePavlich/status/1224545166255706113 https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1224552364977291265 https://twitter.com/DavidWright_7/status/1224561796121534465 https://twitter.com/mviser/status/1224583415078510592 https://twitter.com/davidsiders/status/1224591265834131456 https://twitter.com/tripgabriel/status/1224589455517982725 https://twitter.com/gdebenedetti/status/1224577425763446784 https://twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/1224698026243108864 It’s safe to say that almost everything went wrong at the Democratic caucus this year, thanks to a revised system of reporting that, somewhat impressively, hadn’t been fully tested ahead of time. A day after the caucus, with multiple campaigns putting out their own internal figures and claiming victory, a campaign strategist for Senator Elizabeth Warren brought this bit of level-headedness: https://twitter.com/rospars/status/1224588773763305473 Days later,  with a majority of precincts reporting, it looked as if Pete Buttigeig had, somehow, eked out a win, but there were still noticeable bugs in the system, to say the least. https://twitter.com/TimAlberta/status/1224512561883893762 Well, does anyone have any better ideas? https://twitter.com/AsteadWesley/status/1224511806493859841 The takeaway: Despite the chaos, there was definitely a clear result at the end of the night. https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1224529237316640768 What happened: President Trump gave his third State of the Union address, and reactions were ... mixed. Yeah, let's say mixed. What really happened: As if the Iowa caucus roller coaster didn't provide enough big political news for the week, President Trump also delivered his annual State of the Union speech to Congress—and the world. Considering that the House of Representatives had, you know, impeached him, you can only imagine how this thing went. At first, it was just tense. https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1224876814683852801 And it only went downhill from there. If anyone was hoping that this was going to offer a moment of American unity, they were about to be sorely disappointed. https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1224878734014078976 https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1224881415776624645 https://twitter.com/HeidiNBC/status/1224886754932555782 https://twitter.com/CharlesMBlow/status/1224896333913427968 https://twitter.com/sethmoulton/status/1224904780562227200 Fact checkers were sorely tested during the speech, which was essentially a campaign rally in the wrong place. One of the more surprising elements of the whole thing was the honoring of right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh—who this week revealed he has lung cancer—with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country’s highest civilian honor. https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/1224889616173539329 https://twitter.com/feministabulous/status/1224894130322640896 Meanwhile, some were concerned with what was missing from the speech. https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1224905288526049280 https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1224897559010979841 And one man couldn’t handle sitting quietly while all this was going on. https://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/1225036453085941760 https://twitter.com/Will_P_Goodwin/status/1224914744685006849 Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi didn’t hide how she felt about the speech, either. https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1224897851303628801 https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1224921795872149504 https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1224900230442815489 https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/1224909053173698560 https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/1224902799860883459 The takeaway: In the end, Pelosi arguably won the messaging contest by ripping up the speech—especially with one particular person. https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1225050736435875840 What happened: After all was said and done, the Senate voted to acquit President Trump in his impeachment trial. The court of public opinion, however, didn't totally agree with that decision. What really happened: On Wednesday afternoon, the day after the State of the Union address, the Senate voted—mostly along party lines—to acquit President Trump on both articles of impeachment brought against him. It was, obviously, very big news, and it utterly dominated social media, as should be expected. However, as if to prove the very manner in which the US and—more appropriately for the purposes of this column—social media are divided in this day and age, the subject owned trending topics on Twitter, but in wildly different ways. For example, there was the trending hashtag #AmericansFindTrumpGuilty. https://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/1225169401428746248 https://twitter.com/WordswithSteph/status/1225173179452338176 https://twitter.com/David_Leavitt/status/1225171193940103168 https://twitter.com/funder/status/1225191052975497216 At exactly the same time, though, there was also the trending phrase “Congratulations Mr. President.” https://twitter.com/ScottPresler/status/1225166937560420352 https://twitter.com/NewDayForNJ/status/1225173490749333507 https://twitter.com/LouDobbs/status/1225178327691997185 https://twitter.com/JLPtalk/status/1225176897350332418 As all of the above were finding their ways onto screens around the web, #CountryOverParty was also trending, in recognition of Senator Mitt Romney being the sole Republican willing to vote against his party. https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/1225134832302350336 https://twitter.com/NHJennifer/status/1225150515274747905 In fact, “Romney” in general was trending at that very moment, as well—but some of the tweets were far less complimentary. https://twitter.com/w_terrence/status/1225209205671579649 https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1225208839944818693 https://twitter.com/LouDobbs/status/1225217768716480512 If nothing else, at least Twitter demonstrated just how difficult it might be for the US to come together over, well, anything, in the current climate. Happy 2020, everyone! The takeaway: So, at least we can trust in the course of justice now, right? Isn’t that the takeaway of all of this? Oh, wait. https://twitter.com/adamgoldmanNYT/status/1225382190659272704 What happened: While we should expect all fellow humans to have a level of empathy with everyone, regardless of race, creed, or any other differentiator, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the woman who sang “I Kissed a Girl” is the obvious choice to be an ambassador for the British Asian Trust. What really happened: A surprise announcement—or should that be “surprising announcement”?—came this week at a special event in the UK. https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1224793115032268805 https://twitter.com/KatyPerryIndian/status/1224974280452005889 Finally, we get to see Prince Charles and the artist formerly known as Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson team up! We can only hope that this is the first step toward an inevitable recording career together. But while it’s clearly an honor for the woman whose hits include “Firework,” “Roar,” and [checks notes] “Ur So Gay” to be named an ambassador for the British Asian Trust, it’s an honor that becomes all the more surprising if you stop to consider the fact that Katy Perry was born in California and isn’t Asian, two facts that didn’t escape the attention of folks on social media. https://twitter.com/twlldun/status/1224967418361143296 https://twitter.com/fentyzl/status/1224940297215512576 https://twitter.com/zyusaf13/status/1224968920228093952 https://twitter.com/isabellanaudin/status/1225123757221695489 https://twitter.com/nadinebh_/status/1224825940900970496 https://twitter.com/jasminedotiwala/status/1224984486888321025 Upset at the decision was only one of two leading responses, however. Because what was by far the most popular reaction to the news? We’ll give you a clue: It involves an actor who’s made a career showing up where she really shouldn’t. https://twitter.com/zarawoodz/status/1224990158946295809 https://twitter.com/AsimC86/status/1224837768624459776 https://twitter.com/BeardedGenius/status/1224803601849225218 The takeaway: This seems about right, really. What happened: Which is more meaningful: Putting black faces on the covers of books written by, and starring, white people, or actually doing the work to promote diverse authors in the marketplace? Follow-up question: Which choice do you think the publishing industry made when that query was made? What really happened: While we’re on the topic of cultural appropriation, now is as good a time as any to bring this to your attention. https://twitter.com/PublishersWkly/status/1224830023347122178 That’s right—Barnes and Noble announced a plan to promote diversity in literacy, not by promoting diverse writers, but by releasing different covers for books written by white authors that everyone has already read. Hey, Twitter, what do you have to say about this? I’m sure there’s some feelings to be shared from the presumed target audience of this initiative. https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1224987349236404224 https://twitter.com/MercedesSiler/status/1224877902417629185 https://twitter.com/nidhiart/status/1224873262343061504 https://twitter.com/PKhakpour/status/1224867835131891713 https://twitter.com/BCMorrow/status/1224882343174901760 https://twitter.com/ConStar24/status/1224873463258800128 https://twitter.com/KendraJames_/status/1224870715939143680 https://twitter.com/beasasira/status/1224970965324570625 https://twitter.com/rosiesrambles/status/1225050638087806976 https://twitter.com/TheLincoln/status/1225060407708127234 In the end, the campaign ended up being cancelled due to the online reaction to the announcement. Who said social media can't get anything accomplished? There’s an unexpected upside to all of this, beyond the discussion raising the profile of a number of authors and novels—ahem—and it came from Penguin Random House, the publisher connected with the campaign, seeking to make amends for its part in the whole thing. https://twitter.com/DavidOBowles/status/1225228257378885633 The takeaway: Surely there has to be a better way to celebrate Black History Month and promote diversity in books. If only anyone could think of a better way to promote diversity in books. If only it was possible to imagine that. https://twitter.com/SocksCLE/status/1224888450056425473",0.0

"How Cloudflare Uses Lava Lamps to Guard Against Hackers. Edward Craven Walker lived to see his greatest invention, the lava lamp, make its late-’90s cultural comeback. But the British tinkerer (and famed nudist, incidentally) died before he could witness the 21st-­century digital potential of his analog creation. Inside the San Francisco office of the web security company Cloudflare, 100 units of Craven Walker’s groovy hardware help protect wide swaths of the internet from infiltration. Here’s how it works. Every time you log in to any website, you’re assigned a unique identification number. It should be random, because if hackers can predict the number, they’ll impersonate you. Computers, relying as they do on human-coded patterns, can’t generate true randomness—but nobody can predict the goopy mesmeric swirlings of oil, water, and wax. Cloudflare films the lamps 24/7 and uses the ever-changing arrangement of pixels to help create a superpowered cryptographic key. “Anything that the camera captures gets incorporated into the randomness,” says Nick Sullivan, the company’s head of cryptography, and that includes visitors milling about and light streaming through the windows.

"Fidget spinner factories demand ‘bags of cash’ from suppliers. Want to sell fidget spinners? Bring “bags of cash. ” As demand for the whirling contraptions continues to spiral, companies scrambling to keep them on shelves claim they’re being hit with extortionary practices at the overseas factories that make them. The   weights that cause the spinners to move are in short supply  —   and some charge that Asian manufacturers are hoarding them and asking for much higher prices than the roughly 25 cents apiece they used to charge. Portland, Ore.  Zing, which sells two kinds of spinners called Spinzipz and Spinbladez, has been forced to bring “bags of cash” to some factories in China just to make sure its orders are confirmed, Zing vice president Josh Loerzel told The Post. “The factories are asking for cash up front, and the price varies daily  —   anywhere from 50 percent to 200 percent more,” said Loerzel, whose firm supplies big retailers like Target, Walmart and Toys R Us. In response, Zing recently began hoarding its own stash of the   devices, buying up large quantities for their production needs, Loerzel said. Zing expects to sell up to five million spinners in the US this year and has already shipped about 1 million of them to its retail customers. “The factories would tell us, ‘We don’t have any more of the ball bearings unless you want to pay more,’” Loerzel said. “That’s why we had to change our tactics. ” Almar Sales Co. which sells fidget spinners to Michael’s Stores among other retailers, has also heard of demands for     payment, executive vice president Allen Ashkenazie said. “Factories across China are utilizing every opportunity to control prices by limiting and controlling supply of the original bearings,” he griped. With demand for the gadgets still raging out of control, the factories may keep the upper hand for months to come, sellers fear. Fanatics, the largest licenser of sports merchandise, said sales of the spinners increased by 1, 000 percent over the past week as sports fans scooped up spinners with their favorite team’s logo. “We see this trend continuing through the    season and possibly through the holidays,” said Fanatics president of merchandising, Jack Boyle.",1.0
"A&E’s The Killing Season is only a so-so true crime series, but it’s a powerful social documentary.  If you set out to find a serial killer based primarily on the speculation of an amateur internet forum, you might get as far as tracking down a couple of leads, but you probably wouldn’t be able to dedicate your time, money, and energy to following those leads as far as you could go. And you probably wouldn’t get a sweeping   documentary series out of it.    But that’s just what Cropsey director Josh Zeman does in his new   true crime series for A&E, The Killing Season, which premieres Saturday night. Zeman’s attempts to solve the mystery of the Long Island serial killer based mainly on    interviews and amateur detective work leads him on a sprawling road trip across America to visit one potentially linked crime scene after another. Unlike his previous documentaries, which dealt with urban legends, this story is real. And many of America’s families are still living the journey.       Rating  3     The Killing Season begins as, ostensibly, an attempt by Zeman and his producer Rachel Mills to solve the Long Island serial killer (LISK) case on their own. The LISK murdered his first victim  —   that we know of  —   in 1996. The killer, or, as many theorize, killers, buried her along a strangely desolate stretch of Long Island, where sex workers are numerous. He then killed silently and invisibly for more than a decade.  In 2010, a sex worker named Shannan Gilbert ran from an Oak Beach property screaming into the night that “they” were trying to kill her. After Gilbert spent more than 20 minutes on the phone to 911, her call dropped and she vanished into the night. The search for her resulted in the discovery of four horrifically dismembered bodies wrapped in burlap and buried along Long Island’s Gilgo Beach. Eventually that body count would climb to 10, ranging from a badly beaten transgender sex worker to a mother killed along with her small toddler; Gilbert’s body would be found in the marshes a year later.    LISK may have continued killing until at least 2013. The perpetrator has never been caught, and despite numerous potential suspects, the local police, embroiled in a corruption scandal, have been frustratingly  . Despite intense publicity, police appear to be nowhere closer to catching the serial killer than they were in 2010.    This is where Zeman, along with Mills, who joined Zeman onscreen in their previous documentary Killer Legends, pick up the investigation. Using largely    leads and speculation developed on the popular online   forum Websleuths, they attempt to track the killer wherever their trail might take them. And the trail takes them across the US, from serial killings along the East Coast, through the South and Midwest, and ultimately to another notorious serial killer dumping ground out West. It largely seems like terrible detective work, but through it, an important narrative emerges about marginalized voices in America: why the missing are missing, and why so many dead women across America’s cities and heartland have found no justice.     The Killing Season eventually becomes an important social drama, but it starts out as schmaltzy tabloid stuff “We can be certain that there are far more serial killers than we ever imagined in our nightmares,” investigative journalist Thomas Hargrove says at one point in the first episode. This is the documentary’s thesis statement, but it takes several episodes to remember it. Over the series’ eight episodes, Zeman’s narrative, tone, and editing style shift from annoying theatrics and frustrating leaps from one unsourced hypothesis to the next into what it should have been all along: a sober, mostly   attempt to answer a much larger question about class and crime among America’s underprivileged communities.  This picture, however, emerges mainly through a lot of gimmicky storytelling tactics early: dramatic sound effects, dark insinuations made based on little evidence, and grand statements made with little nuance. Viewers of Zeman’s earlier documentaries might be familiar with these traits  —   Zeman used them to good effect in Cropsey and Killer Legends, both of which focused on the potentially true origin stories behind urban legends. Zeman grew up on Long Island and turned to it for the subject of Cropsey, so it makes sense that the mystery of LISK would have drawn him and Mills back to the area. But he and Mills seem wholly unequipped, even uninterested, to actually dig into the evidence and details of the LISK case. Instead, they focus on the community most affected by the serial killer: Long Island’s sex workers.     This could make for a really compelling first few episodes, but the filmmaker’s introduction to the world of sex work is mired in drama and  . The documentarians are baffled that sex workers continue to post online after the bodies are discovered  —   each of the first four victims advertised on Craigslist  —   and that they continue to operate within the killer’s “hunting grounds. ” They speculate that perhaps it’s “the lure of easy money” that draws the women in; they wonder if the women “knew the dangers they were facing. ” After they’ve procured a real live sex worker who agrees to let them accompany her through her weekly routine, the filmmakers dramatically film her entering a     hotel, then freak out when she doesn’t return immediately. “Out here, any decision she makes could be one of life or death,” they declare. They’re not wrong  —   serial killers notoriously prey on prostitutes because they are available and less likely to be missed. But painting sex workers as naive, vulnerable women blindly wandering into certain death gives the documentary a touch of histrionics  —   and, given where it finally takes us, one might even say concern trolling. So, too, do the innumerable scenes where the filmmakers choose to visit potentially dangerous locations at night instead of broad daylight. Early on, several scenes like these seem like they were awkwardly staged for dramatic effect. Even though they’re making a documentary that seeks to understand sex workers and the working class, the filmmakers indulge, again and again, in easy condescension, generalization, and stereotyping that undermines their eventual conclusions. They even, at times, display what seems to be a callousness about what impact their camera might be having. At one point they misgender a transgender sex worker and speculate that her killer might have beaten her to death because he felt “tricked. ” One lead, which goes nowhere, involves them tracking down and visibly revealing the whereabouts and identity of a woman who states, on camera, that she moved out of another state to avoid a specific suspect who had physically assaulted her in the past. If this is true, it’s odd that the filmmakers cavalierly showed exactly where she lives now.  At another point they imply, both without evidence and without apparently doing anything with their suspicions, that a   Florida family is hiding deep secrets on their   property because they didn’t sell the place after bodies were discovered there. This assumes, of course, that leaving was even an option for a poor family living under the eye of the police, or that the only reason one would have for staying on a property for decades after a serial killer dumped bodies there must have been nefarious.     The Killing Season relies primarily on amateur sleuthing to find what story it can This kind of lazy narrative dogs the filmmakers at every turn throughout its first half, and makes the series a frustrating watch up until about episode five. It’s all unnecessary melodrama, especially when there are so many other fascinating aspects of the LISK story the documentary team could have chosen to work through instead: the strange behavior of potential suspects around the crime, alleged police   the possibility of multiple killers working together, the role of mental illness, and lingering questions about what happened the night Gilbert disappeared. Instead, absent much cooperation from the Long Island police, the narrative relies heavily on speculation from Websleuths. This popular internet forum has spawned a massive community of amateur internet detectives, many of them professionals or retired members of law enforcement or related fields, who use their powers to identify missing persons and generate leads and suspects in unsolved crimes. The community has been remarkably successful at doing its work, and has even attracted the attention of suspects themselves. In particular, The Killing Season relies on tips from a   amateur profiler named Peter Brent. Brent wonders if maybe the erratic pattern and inconsistent circumstances of the recovered bodies indicate two serial killers in competition with one another, a theory the series pursues without gaining much traction.  At other points, Zeman and Mills seem to spend time on wild goose chases, like time spent pursuing a lead based on a Wikipedia edit. The investigation proceeds through a series of   interviews and following increasingly more   (both logically and geographically)    leads that take them across the country. One Websleuths tip sends the filmmakers off to Daytona Beach, which in turn sends them spiraling down a rabbit hole of crime and sex trafficking. For anyone waiting to see how any of these tangents connect back to LISK, the answer is: not very well.  Conjecture without substance runs rampant throughout much of the documentary. The documentary insists that there’s a “pattern” linking the Atlantic City serial killer with the Long Island serial killer because the location of a possible killing site looks kind of like the dumping ground of Long Island. (“Same reeds,” says Zeman.) This observation is hailed as a clue, and nothing is said about the obvious context that anyone looking to dump a body would choose somewhere remote and desolate like a rundown stretch of overgrown marsh. Occasionally the filmmakers make giant deductive leaps and illogical conclusions, zooming from point A to point C without stopping to explain the trajectory through point B. A former producer for America’s Most Wanted claims to have discovered the identity of someone the filmmakers believe could be responsible for a series of serial killings in Atlantic City  —   but the documentary doesn’t tell us how the producer came to that conclusion, or how the producer was able to capture the man’s photo. Whatever   they do rarely makes it on camera. Each witness is treated with equal credulity; even a   lead that appears to have merit is simply dropped by the documentarians without any  . Throughout the series, lead after lead goes nowhere or dries up due to what seems to be the filmmakers’ inability to either gather or conduct any real forensic research.    The narration insists, again and again, that incidents are dramatic without spelling out why. At one point Zeman and Mills insist the LISK has made a mistake in revealing too much to the friends and family of victims to whom he placed calls after the murders, but this assertion is pure conjecture and never plays a satisfying role in what is, by this point, the duo’s halfhearted attempt to pretend the documentary is still attempting to solve the LISK murders. The documentary is at its best when it contextualizes its crimes In both Cropsey and Killer Legends, Zeman successfully places urban legends in the context of larger American anxieties, painting a picture of horror emerging from an evolving nation. Early on, notably in Atlantic City, he does that in The Killing Season as well. But it’s not until the team travels to Daytona Beach that the tone and focus of their narrative finally shifts away from their narrative’s frustrating superimposed drama and illogical amateur   theatrics into something more meaningful.  In Daytona, they meet a woman who has been mourning the death of her best friend for years, keeping her ashes in her living room at her feet by the couch. In a beautifully filmed scene at a local bar, she describes her own feelings of guilt for allowing her friend to wander into the path of a serial killer. And just like that, The Killing Season has something real to say, and real work to do: allowing the real stories of countless dead sex workers and their grieving communities to be told in their own terms. Armed with this new direction, the second half of the series is markedly different in both tone and focus from the first half. The filmmakers take us across America, stopping at Oklahoma City for a look at the grueling lifestyles of   truckers and the women who do highly dangerous sex work at truck stops. And finally they end up in Albuquerque, where an outraged community has never gotten over the   notorious West Mesa murders. At turns, the documentary touches on the important work being done to combat the serial killings, like the FBI’s Highway Serial Killer Initiative and the Murder Accountability Project. It also draws attention to the underfunding, understaffing, and systemic inadequacy of federal and local departments attempting to deal with the epidemic of murdered women across the country. Investigator Hargrove, who created the Murder Accountability Project, points out that the nation’s solved homicide rate has declined to only about   of all reported murders. Mark Safarik, former FBI profiler, notes that the FBI only has eight profilers available to work on federal investigations after  . The implication that the agency, along with other federal agencies, had all its resources redirected toward terrorist surveillance, at great cost to its domestic policing, is clear.  Ultimately, The Killing Season unfolds a story of tremendous power about an underclass of voiceless communities across the country. That story is at its best when it drops its largely ineffectual true crime trappings and focuses on the much broader story at its heart: the social context of a nation full of women who have largely been abandoned by the system put in place to protect them  —   or, at the very least, give them justice after it’s failed to keep them safe.

"""Gang member"" and ""thug"" roles in film are disproportionately played by black actors.               In any given film, there are dozens of actors whose roles are unnamed in the credits  —   ”nurse #1” or ”man with balloons,” for instance. Their job is to go unnoticed, yet they are integral to the realism of cinema: In the background, they mill about naturally and seamlessly, transporting us into their world.    Last week, we took a look at the gender differences between the most common roles given to these background actors. We found a dramatic power dynamic at play: While ”cop,” ”guard,” and ”doctor” topped the list for men, women were frequently relegated to such roles as ”party girl” and ”receptionist.”         But we noticed something else interesting: For men, ”gang member” ranked in the top 10. We were curious: Who exactly is cast as a gang member in film? To answer this question, we turned to Bruce Nash at the Numbers, who has spend years compiling a database of 160, 000 acting credits from 26, 000 major US movie releases. Using this data, we pulled a list of every actor who was credited as playing a ”gang member,” ”gangster,” ”gangbanger,” or ”thug,” then looked them up individually. We recorded each actor’s race (when noted on a CV or agency site) and omitted anyone nonverifiable.    The answer: Gang member (and related) roles are disproportionately filled by black actors.                 In total, we looked up 220 actors who played these roles, all but four of whom were men. An astounding 62 percent of all actors who were credited as ”gang member” are black. Related credits  —   ”gangster” (61 percent black) ”gangbanger” (60 percent) and ”thug” (66 percent)  —    drew similar results. Interestingly, another related term we looked at, the slightly more dignified ”henchman,” was 81 percent white and only 4 percent black.    But black actors do not enjoy the same representation within other typical minor roles in film. Among actors who played a ”police officer,” for instance, only 18 percent were black. For ”doctor” and ”pilot”  —   two other common background roles  —   the stats were even worse, at 9 and 3 percent, respectively. These figures are not a reflection of   demographics. According to the most recent statistics compiled by the National Gang Center, black people represent 35 percent of all gang members in America. Yet in Hollywood, they represent 64 percent of all onscreen gang members.         White actors are overrepresented here too. This could be due to an effort by directors to diversify large groups of criminals onscreen.    Being black in the audition room Hollywood’s apparent preference for black actors in   roles is a signifier that the industry’s casting directors engage in typecasting. Bear Bellinger, a black actor, touched on this in a post for Vox earlier this year:  ”I am a black man constantly having to conform my blackness to what white people, mainly men, on the other side of the [casting] table believe to be true. These men have no ill intent in their ideas about or depictions of blackness; they also have no lived experience. And mine, as the only actual black person in the room, is almost never valued or understood.”               Another actor, who played a ”gangbanger” in the 2005 crime drama Four Brothers, saw a similar problem. Like several other black actors I spoke with, he wished to remain anonymous, for fear of being labeled the ”angry black guy.” ”As an actor, you have to take the roles you can get,” he told me. ”But when a director is casting gang members or thugs for a film, a lot of the time you’ll be told  —   or it’s hinted at  —   that he’s looking specifically for a [black man] and that’s weird to me.” Not all actors who play these roles agree. ”I have no problem at all with it,” says Shun Hagins, who was credited as a ”heavy gangster” in Snitch (2013) and has played similar roles in other films. ”I will take any kind of work long as it is cutting checks.”    ”I grew up around thug and gangsters,” he adds. ”I have seen so many killings and fights; playing these roles comes easy. I have a lifetime of hood in me. That’s just who I am.” In any case, one problem seems to be that screenwriters, casting managers, and directors (the majority of whom are white) have free rein to choose whom they see fit for certain roles. What we see on the screen are their preconceived notions of racial roles. Until directorial roles are more reputably diversified  —   in terms of both gender and race  —   these issues are likely to continue. ",-1.0
"Italian fashion designer Laura Biagiotti dies at age 73. ROME  —   Laura Biagiotti, an Italian fashion designer who conquered global markets with her soft, loose women’s clothes and luxurious knits that won her the nickname “Queen of Cashmere,” died on Friday following a heart attack. She was 73. Biagiotti suffered the heart attack Wednesday evening at her estate outside of Rome. Doctors were able to resuscitate her but by then serious brain damage had occurred. Her daughter, Lavinia Biagiotti Cigna, announced her mother’s death on Twitter, conveying the news with a Biblical passage: “In the house of my father there are many places. If not, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. ” Biagiotti began designing women’s clothes in the 1960s and by the 1980s was making her mark. In 1988, she became the first Italian designer to put on a fashion show in China, presenting dresses and blouses in silk and cashmere, and in 1995 was the first to have a show inside the Kremlin walls in Moscow. She expanded into men’s clothing as well, and created a   women’s line, Laura Piu, and a line for children. Her company produced sunglasses and perfumes, including the popular “Roma” fragrance, named after Biagiotti’s home city. Born Aug. 4, 1943, Biagiotti studied to become an archaeologist but abandoned those plans to help her mother run a dressmaking business. In those early years, she traveled frequently to the United States to learn business and technology. After collaborating with such famous fashion houses as Shubert and Capucci, she presented her own collection in Florence in 1972. “Being a fashion designer is like taking vows. It becomes your religion for life,” she told The Associated Press in 1987. She was always deeply proud of her native Italy, and for years wore a cashmere shawl woven in the red, white and green colors of the nation’s flag. “I’m convinced that the true gold mine in our country is the ‘Made in Italy’ label,” she said in 2011. Biagiotti lived in a   castle on a hilltop outside of Rome that she had restored, and which was the headquarters for her business. Her husband, Gianni Cigna, who had also been her business partner, died of leukemia in 1996.  She is survived by her daughter Lavinia, who works as the creative director of the fashion house.",1.0
"The economic shock of a ‘Brexit’.    Sebastian Mallaby is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Washington Post Global Opinions contributing columnist. He is an editor at InFacts. org, a website campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union.      LONDON  For the first time since the start of Britain’s referendum fight over Europe, the polls predict “Brexit. ” The four most recent national surveys put the “Leave” side ahead with margins of between one and 10 percentage points. Most people, including many disaffected Britons who want to shake up the system by backing a Brexit, understand that this would mean a political and economic shock. But they underestimate its severity. The morning after a “Leave” vote, Britain would find itself in a political, legal and constitutional limbo. Having staked his credibility on a “Remain” victory, Prime Minister David Cameron would probably be forced out, despite his recent protestations to the contrary  —   his senior Conservative colleague, Ken Clarke, says he “wouldn’t last 30 seconds. ” Choosing a new Conservative Party leader is a   process, with the second stage involving party members voting by mail. It could drag on for three months or so.   Euro zone industrial production rebounded in April on a monthly basis after two consecutive falls. As Hayley Platt reports, the better than expected data was largely due to a surge in output of durable consumer goods, like cars. (Reuters)   Britons  —   and British businesses, especially  —   would confront a nightmare of legal uncertainty. Large swaths of British regulation derive from E. U. rules and would have to be rewritten. Britain’s commercial relationship with its main trading partners would be up in the air, with no clarity about whether, or on what terms, Britain would retain membership in the E. U. single market. Global businesses with London headquarters would be scrambling to figure out if they should move. Fully 40 percent of Europe’s top companies and 60 percent of   multinationals have chosen London as their E. U. base. Their departure could trigger a real estate bust, clobbering consumer spending.  The United Kingdom would find itself considerably less united. A majority of Scots want to stay in the E. U. and might seek to do so by demanding a referendum on independence from Britain. The last Scottish independence vote, in 2014, went in favor of the union because Scots were persuaded that the economic price of breakup was too high. But if Britain quits the E. U. and succumbs to a recession, the economic case may become too weak to trump Scottish nationalism. Northern Ireland would also be destabilized. The Catholic half of the population wants to stay in the E. U. alongside the Irish Republic. If Northern Ireland were dragged out of the E. U. by voters in England, Catholics would be resentful. Meanwhile, the basis for Northern Ireland’s economy  —   a porous border with the south  —   would take a whack. A business on the north side of the border would face greater hassles in recruiting workers and customers in the south, because the   frontier would have to be subjected to passport and customs checks. This uncertainty could last anywhere from a couple of years to, say, seven  —   the number plucked out of the air this week by a senior E. U. leader. The only precedent for Brexit was set by Greenland in 1985. But Greenland’s population came to a grand total of 53, 000, the only issue Greenland cared about was fish, and even then the divorce proceedings took three years to settle. Britain is Europe’s   economy. A breakup would be altogether messier.  What’s more, Britain’s E. U. partners would not make the exit easy. Governments in Germany, France and elsewhere fear  . U. populists at home; they would need to punish Britain to send a message to their own electorates. They would also want to profit from the mess  —   for example, France hopes to lure French bankers and their money from London back to Paris. And even if, through some miracle of generosity, the leading E. U. members wanted to make divorce easy, they would not be able to do so. The terms of the exit would have to be agreed upon by 27 fractious member states that face distractions ranging from refugees to Vladi mir Putin. Brexiteers may soon discover that, if there is one thing more frustrating than being in the E. U. it is trying to get out of it.  Facing a political vacuum, legal and constitutional uncertainty, and the prospect of a nightmarish negotiation with the E. U. the British economy would probably suffer a deeper recession than the mild one foreseen by some forecasters. There is a Lehman quality to this: Fear and uncertainty are hard to quantify in a model, but they can be devastating to    economies. And Britain’s vulnerability is especially acute because its trade deficit as a share of gross domestic product is by far the largest among the world’s advanced economies. To pay for its imports, it relies on daily infusions of capital from abroad. If the voters go for Brexit on June 23, the infusions will sputter and the pound will probably collapse, cutting the spending power of workers. A week is a long time in politics, and Britain may yet step back from the abyss. But it is good to be clear now that the abyss is a deep one.    Read more about this topic:    Robert J.

"Tech execs, US officials to review militants’ social media use. WASHINGTON  —   Senior White House officials and US intelligence and law enforcement figures will meet with Silicon Valley executives on Friday to discuss the use of social media by militant groups, sources familiar with the meeting said on Thursday. In an escalation of pressure on technology firms to do more to combat online propaganda from groups such as the Islamic State, the meeting follows attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, that underscored the role played by social media companies such as Twitter Inc. Alphabet Inc. ’s YouTube and Facebook Inc. Invited participants include White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, presidential counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, National Intelligence Director James Clapper and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, one of the sources said. A source familiar with the meeting said it would focus on social media content, not encrypted communications, another topic of discussion between Silicon Valley and the White House. Twitter last week updated its policies for policing its content to explicitly prohibit “hateful conduct. ” Other websites have similarly updated and clarified their abuse policies within the past 18 months. The meeting agenda covers how to make it harder for militants to recruit and mobilize followers on social media, as well as helping ordinary users create, publish and amplify content that can undercut groups like the Islamic State. The meeting also will touch on how technology can be used to disrupt paths to violent radicalization and identify recruitment patterns, and how to make it easier for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify militant operatives. Twitter confirmed it will send at least one representative, but CEO Jack Dorsey will not attend. Apple Inc. Facebook and Google are also attending, the companies said. Several other Internet firms have been invited, according to those familiar with the meeting. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Amid rising public concern about the potential for more attacks, President Barack Obama in a speech in December said, “I will urge   and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. ” Tech firms have been increasingly cooperative, taking down content viewed as capable of inciting violence or recruiting militants. But those same firms are often reluctant to appear too cozy with government investigators, a concern that grew after Edward Snowden disclosed wide government surveillance.",1.0
"Thirteen bald eagles were found dead on a Maryland farm.  Thirteen bald eagles were found dead over the weekend near a farm on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in what authorities say is the largest single   of bald eagles in the state in 30 years. Officials with the Maryland Natural Resources Police said they received a call around 2:30 p. m. Saturday from a man who said he was out looking for antlers that deer might have shed and came across what he initially thought was a dead turkey in a field on a farm in Caroline County. He discovered it was four dead bald eagles. When officers arrived, they found nine additional dead bald eagles in the field on Laurel Grove Road in Federalsburg. It was not immediately clear what had caused the birds to die, but there were “no obvious signs of trauma with these birds,” according to Candy Thomson, a natural resources police spokeswoman. The discovery of 13 dead bald eagles was the largest single incident in decades for the state, officials said. At least three of the birds were mature, with the signature white heads and brown bodies. Two of the birds were close to being mature birds, officials said, and the rest were considered immature birds with no white feathers. “It’s been 30 years since we’ve seen anything like this involving this many dead bald eagles,” Thomson said. “Three mature eagles, the ones we all love that look like the national bird, are gone.  “It’s sad that we have three eagles of mating ability that have been eliminated from our population. ” A reward of $2, 500 is being offered for information in the case.  [Watch live: ‘Mr. President’ and ‘The First Lady’ nest at National Arboretum]  Thomson said the birds were tagged and the scene was photographed. The natural resources police and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating the incident. Officials with the federal agency said the carcasses will be sent to a forensic lab in Oregon. “This is significant,” said Catherine Hibbard, an agency spokeswoman. She said one of the investigators on the case said “he’s never seen that many dead at one time” in his eight years of work on the Eastern Shore. Thirty years ago, officials said, eight bald eagles were found dead in Maryland. Officials said they believe those birds may have been poisoned. And two years ago, two bald eagles were shot and killed in a week in Montgomery County. It is illegal to shoot eagles without a permit from the U. S. Department of the Interior.  [Bald eagles shot and killed in Montgomery County]  In that case in Montgomery County, one eagle was found shot Christmas Day in a field in Brookville. The bird was feeding on a deer carcass when it was shot, officials said. Officials had said they thought the Brookville case was one of mistaken identity where someone might have seen a bird sitting on a carcass of a deer and thought they were shooting a vulture. A few days later, another eagle was found near a residence in Darnestown. That bird was found alive, but it died of its injuries. Police said an   showed the eagle had been hit by bird shot. In the Darnestown case, officials said they were worried because someone came into a residential area and was possibly shooting where they should not have been. In this latest case on the Eastern Shore, officials said, one possibility is the birds ate carcasses of dead animals that had ingested poison. Bald eagles are no longer on the endangered species list, but they are considered a protected species, according to the natural resources police. Anyone with information is asked to call   . ",-0.5
"‘Angel of Death’ serial killer badly beaten in prison. TOLEDO, Ohio  —   A serial killer known as the “Angel of Death” after he admitted killing three dozen hospital patients in Ohio and Kentucky during the 1970s and ’80s was beaten in his cell and is in critical condition, state authorities said Wednesday. Donald Harvey, who is serving multiple life sentences, was found in his cell Tuesday afternoon at the state’s prison in Toledo, said JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for Ohio’s prison system. While details about his injuries weren’t released, the State Highway Patrol said he was in critical condition Wednesday. He was beaten after an unnamed person went into his cell, a patrol report said. Harvey, 64, pleaded guilty in 1987 to killing 37 people, mostly while he worked as a nurse’s aide at hospitals in Cincinnati and London, Kentucky. He later claimed he was responsible for killing 18 people while working at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati. He told his former attorney the killings began in 1970 when was at Marymount Hospital in Kentucky. Many of his victims were chronically ill patients and he claimed he was trying to end their suffering. Harvey used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of his victims, often putting it in the hospital food he served them, prosecutors said. Some of the patients were suffocated when he let their oxygen tanks run out. He was caught after a medical examiner smelled cyanide while performing an autopsy on a victim. Harvey told a newspaper after he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty that he liked the control of determining who lived and died.",1.0
"How a middle schooler incepted the internet with a hoax about a bad ’90s cartoon.  Everything a tiny fraction of the internet knows about an obscure TV show called Street Sharks is a lie.    Geek. com writer Jordan Minor announced on Thursday that in the early 2000s, he made a habit of trolling a     site called TV Tome by adding a bunch of fake information about the   syndicated cartoon, which aired for three seasons in the  ’90s. Minor, who at the time was a rebellious middle schooler, says he made up episodes, storylines, and a female character named ”Roxie.” He even cleverly added real actors to the mix; for example, he listed Henry Winkler as one of Street Sharks’ guest stars, in a    homage to Winkler’s famous ”jump the shark” episode of Happy Days. And then, like all good vandals, Minor moved on. Not everyone else did, however. Because of the way (mis) information tends to spread online, Minor’s brief moment of fabrication circulated the web for more than a decade.    Minor’s joke perfectly illustrates how bad information travels on the web Minor’s   hoax reveals nothing new about the internet, which is full of similar fabrications  —   often sly Easter eggs slipped into Wikipedia entries or other open source wikis, usually meant for humorous effect. Take the hoax of Olimar the Wondercat, an entirely fake Wikipedia page about a fake TV show that one Wikipedia editor created and maintained for years. Named after the editor’s cat, the page ultimately outgrew the original hoax, as other editors got in on the joke by adding fun ”facts” and other fictional tidbits about the   program.    The same thing happened with Minor’s Street Sharks endeavor. After TV Tome was merged into the website TV. com in 2005, the information from its Street Sharks entry began to spread. If you’ve ever run an internet search for a phrase cited on Wikipedia or another open source wiki site, you’ve undoubtedly learned that the web is full of garbage   sites that lift whole passages from wiki pages without actually bothering to   or confirm any of their content. Sometimes pages that provide information without citing any sources or including any disclaimers are eventually passed around as factual. Other times, the sources provided are themselves completely bunk.    And so Minor’s Street Sharks fibs and falsehoods became fodder for the completely deteriorated current state of the internet’s collective memory of the show. Minor writes, ”I’ve found forum posts of people saying [the character he invented named] Roxie was their favorite character, and read IMDB reviews of people fondly remembering episodes that don’t exist.” He’s also found people passionately declaring that they once owned VHS tapes containing episodes he knows never existed, because he concocted them. Meanwhile, he alleges that real Street Sharks voice actor Andrew Rannells (who now plays Elijah on Girls) once supported the idea that Winkler also    —   just because Minor once said so on the internet. The internet’s collective memory is powerful  —   and not always accurate Minor cites these incidents as evidence that truth on the web is largely unknowable  —   but he also fails to allow for the possibility that plenty of other people could’ve simply been playing along with his joke, as humans on the web are wont to do. For instance, he describes his   character Roxie as ”loosely based” on a real character named Rox, so it’s possible that people were simply misremembering the original character’s name rather than playing into a collectively generated false memory.    Collectively generated false memories do happen, of course. Sometimes our collective memory is so powerful that when the internet provides us with insurmountable ”evidence” to the contrary, instantaneous conspiracy theories arise. The Wikipedia entry for the Berenstain Bears has a Talk Page with an entire section devoted to discussing the belief that the title of popular children’s book series The Berenstain Bears once spelled ”Berenstein” with an ” ” instead of an ” .” So many people insist that they remember seeing Berenstain spelled ”Berenstein” that a parallel universe theory has arisen to try to explain it  —   an example of something called the Mandela Effect, in which a parallel universe is used to explain collective unsubstantiated memories. Another collectively generated false internet memory concerns the ending of a 1988 TV movie called 14 Going on 30. So many people have mistaken the movie’s ending as a lost alternate ending to the beloved Tom Hanks movie Big, which has a similar plot, that threads arguing over whether the alternate ending of Big was actually real proliferate; one thread at the Straight Dope was started in 2002 and is still continuing today. There’s even a famous Creepypasta (a story that belongs to the vast and popular genre of the same name that trades in   internet urban legends) known as ”Candle Cove,” which plays on the idea of these eerie collective false memories of pop culture. ”Candle Cove” simulates a conversation on an early internet message board where users are asking whether anyone else remembers the creepy children’s TV show they watched in their childhood known as Candle Cove. As the thread progresses, more memories are revealed, and the thread participants start to simultaneously doubt their own memories and realize that the ”real” TV show was more terrifying than any of them guessed. If the internet is malleable, is anything real? In looking back on his adolescent Street Sharks, uh, ”experience,” Minor concludes that his story is a dizzying reminder that the internet is constantly  —   and rapidly  —   rewriting history. Of course, that assumes history was ever a knowable conundrum to begin with. Research into false memories has shown for decades that getting people to misremember   events is fairly simple, which is why eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Studies have also shown that it’s easy to influence someone else’s memory simply by claiming to remember something different.    Even Minor admits that ”my lies were mixed with   truths,” noting that he can no longer really remember what was real and what wasn’t. His ultimate takeaway that the web is unreliable and fallible really speaks to the greater truth: that collective human memory itself is unreliable and fallible. Perhaps the most useful lesson to glean from Street Sharks is that we live in an age when the internet never forgets but memory is fallible, lying is easy, and citations are often needed but rarely provided  —   and even when they are, there’s always the chance, however slight, that your ”source” could be a trickster like Minor. Given all this, instead of wondering why lies are so thoroughly pervasive online, perhaps we should focus on the positive: It’s a miracle we know anything at all.

"Why the conservative push to repeal Obamacare is stalling yet again.  The Trumpcare revival is flailing just a few days after it got started.    Republican lawmakers left a big meeting on Tuesday night signaling that there had been no great breakthrough on the issues that derailed the American Health Care Act two weeks ago. Another meeting is expected today, though it’s not clear what there is left to do. No new legislative text has been made public.  The overarching question is whether this was a real play to get a bill passed, or whether the competing factions would merely use it as an opportunity to blame the others for the impasse. The White House, House leadership, and the far right and centrist wings of the Republican caucus have all faced criticism for the original bill’s failure. What’s clear right now is that things aren’t going well  —   and a new round of   is already underway.      are putting the heat on moderates When Trumpcare first failed last month, it was due in part to the   Freedom Caucus. That group of three dozen or so lawmakers was mostly against the bill because it didn’t fully repeal Obamacare. President Donald Trump criticized its leaders publicly after the bill’s failure, even making tacit threats to support primary challengers against them:      The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017    Despite that impasse, Republican lawmakers and the White House have pledged to keep working on the issue and rumors of a new plan began popping up. Freedom Caucus leaders trumpeted a renewed optimism early this week that they’d get something done. And a key ally of that group claims that those lawmakers were coming around on a compromise, only to have talks stall now because of the moderate “Coverage Caucus”  —   Republicans who want a bill that won’t cause big coverage losses.    In a blistering call on Wednesday morning, Michael Needham, who leads Heritage Action for America  —   one of the most prominent outside groups that had been opposed to the AHCA  —   laid the blame for the latest stumbles at the feet of moderate House Republicans, who are part of a coalition known as the Tuesday Group. According to Needham, the White House presented conservatives with a plan on Monday that they would have accepted. It would have allowed states to broadly waive Obamacare’s insurance reforms, such as the rule that prohibits health plans from charging sicker people more than healthy ones and minimum requirements for what health insurance must cover. For the Freedom Caucus, this would have been a compromise: The infrastructure of Obamacare would stay in place, but states would have the chance to create an alternative  —   though under such an alternative, fewer people would likely be covered and sicker people could see higher costs. Nonetheless, that plan would have gotten upwards of 20 votes from the Freedom Caucus, Needham said, which would seem to get the bill close to the 216 votes it needs to clear the House. A Freedom Caucus aide confirmed the group saw that proposal as a positive step.    But moderates balked, according to Needham, and that has derailed the negotiations for now.  Those centrist Republicans have been skittish from the start because they are concerned about the AHCA’s consequences for their constituents. The Congressional Budget Office projected that 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the initial bill. Many of those lawmakers have promised to preserve Obamacare’s protections for people with preexisting conditions, which the waivers favored by the Freedom Caucus would either directly or effectively unravel in states that sought them. “This happened because of the intransigence of the Tuesday Group, which refuses to get to yes,” Needham said. “I think the Tuesday Group clearly wants to keep Obamacare in place. ” Because of the moderate opposition, Needham said the proposal had since been narrowed, allowing waivers only from the minimum insurance requirements and Obamacare’s limits on how much more health plans can charge older customers. He described that proposal as a “ ” for conservatives. That would appear to leave the bill again well short of what it needs to pass. All this drama is bringing the contentious relationship between House leadership and the Freedom Caucus and outside groups like Heritage back to the foreground. Alongside the moderates, Needham sought to put the squeeze on House leaders like Speaker Ryan for the failures of the latest talks. “It is the job of Paul Ryan to get them to vote yes,” he said. “It’s the job for Paul Ryan to get that original proposal through. ”    Aides close to leadership have emphasized, however, that this latest effort is a White   affair. So the debate is back at the same dividing lines that stunted Trumpcare the first time around: Conservatives want to roll back as much of Obamacare as they can, but moderates are concerned about the consequences of doing so. The White House is leading this effort, but nobody is sure what happens now One thing is abundantly clear: This time around, replacing Obamacare is the White House’s show.  Trump administration officials are the common denominator in every meeting  —   they have met with lawmakers from the   Freedom Caucus as well as members of the Tuesday Group who had previously supported AHCA. Vice President Mike Pence, budget director Mick Mulvaney and Health Secretary Tom Price helped lead the   discussion with both wings at the Capitol on Tuesday night. But now that the talks have run aground, you have to wonder: What did they think was going to happen? Did they really believe they were on the precipice of a deal? Or was this a show for the public, to try to save face from the bill’s humiliating defeat a couple weeks ago? The prevailing theory among lobbyists is the latter. The AHCA’s failure was a big loss for the Trump White House in its first legislative push. Though President Trump signaled he was ready to move on, that wasn’t palatable for a party that had pledged for seven years to repeal Obamacare.    It looks likely to drag on. Heritage’s Needham said on Wednesday morning that lawmakers should go home on their scheduled   Easter break and figure out what to do next. Ryan seems to be operating under the same assumption:   ”We’re having very productive conversations” Speaker Ryan says of ACA repeal effort; ”we can keep working this for weeks.” —   Jonathan Nicholson (@JNicholsonInDC) April 5, 2017    ",-1.0
"Howard Dean was warning people about the opioid crisis a decade ago.  “If there were an emperor of progressive Democrats, Howard Dean would be the man  —   except of course his fellow Vermonter, Sanders, is now that man,” Ben Sarle wrote for the Atlantic last year. Certainly it’s hard to imagine the unexpected success of Bernie Sanders’s and Barack Obama’s campaigns without Dean’s insurgent  ’04 presidential run. Dean inspired thousands of new youth organizers, pioneered the use of digital technologies for political campaigns, and amassed sizable funds through many modest donations.     In March 2003, Dean righteously slammed the Democrats’ establishment leadership, opening a California speech: ”What I want to know is what in the world so many Democrats are doing supporting the president’s unilateral intervention in Iraq?” The doctor turned popular Vermont governor’s catchphrase was that he was from ”the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party,” and he was blunt about the failings of both his own side and the Bush administration.     The Democrats’ frontrunner collapsed in the Iowa vote, after coordinated attacks from the party hierarchy, and he quit the race after finishing second to John Kerry in New Hampshire. Dean morphed his campaign into Democracy for America. The   organization’s goal? To “empower the progressive grassroots to take our democracy back from corporations and the wealthy few and aggressively combat growing income inequality. ” While Dean was chair of the Democratic National Committee, between 2005 and 2009, the party took back the House, the Senate, and the White House.   I spoke with Dean, now 68, over the phone from his Burlington home. We discussed health care and Iraq, politics as war, Dean’s beef with business, and Donald Trump’s “mental problems. ”     This conversation has been condensed and edited.  Alexander Bisley What messages were you advancing back in 2004 that you most wish people listened to you on?    Howard Dean  I think I’ve been proven right about a number of things: the war in Iraq, Bush’s tax cuts, which ran up huge debts, and his lack of regulation, which allowed the entire infrastructure of the Western financial world to collapse. I don’t think Republicans know anything about fiscal policy; I don’t think they care. I think they’re so ideologically driven that they don’t care about balanced budgets. You wait and see Trump’s tax cuts; I guarantee the budget will be less balanced afterward. Republicans are ideologues; they don’t care what the facts are. Alexander Bisley You were prescient about the opioid epidemic. In a 2001 interview with the LA Times, you warned about OxyContin’s catastrophic impact; as governor, you restricted its prescription in Vermont.    Howard Dean Right  —   because I was a physician, I could see that one coming. There was no real need for OxyContin. It was highly addictive, and there were lots of reasons it became so addictive. That was what really created the heroin addiction, which is the scourge of our country, everywhere. Once the government forced OxyContin to reformulate so you couldn’t abuse it as easily, people switched to heroin because it was more available and cheaper.              Alexander Bisley Do you think the opioid epidemic played a role in getting Donald Trump elected president? Howard Dean  I think it did have an effect. There’s a sort of constellation of hopelessness in a lot of rural America for many reasons, and I think the opioid endemic is pretty high on their list of worries. It’s on my list as the three things we have to do to try to reconstruct rural America.     First is real tax reform  —   not the kind that Trump is about to pass that helps billionaires, but the kind that actually encourages investment in places that need it. Second is a better education system, not the kind that [Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos wants, which is to privatize all the schools with lower quality.  The third is dealing with the opioid epidemic, which is one of the reasons Obamacare is so important. It may not be perfect, but it certainly does help people who have really serious drug problems. We’re going to have to use a medical model to deal with this problem because throwing everybody in jail clearly doesn’t work. We need to be smart about what happens to people who are in trouble. If they’re violent and dangerous, obviously they have to be in prison. But if they have a drug problem, they probably need to be in treatment [instead]. Alexander Bisley Obamacare has given 20 million more Americans health care. However, even Obama acknowledged it needs improvements. What would you suggest? Howard Dean  A bunch of things. First of all, I’d allow people under 65 to buy into Medicare on a voluntary basis. There would never be the problem of not having an adequate number of insurance companies in the market. If insurance companies chose to leave a market, for whatever reason, you’d have Medicare as a backup.  Number two, I actually would get rid of the individual mandate. If you’re a purist about the insurance market, you need it. But we managed to insure every child under 18 in Vermont minus 1 percent, and we didn’t have a mandate. For the 1 percent that are going to do the wrong thing, it’s not worth antagonizing the 99 percent that don’t want to be told what to do by the government. There’s plenty of people across the entire political spectrum that feel that way; that’s not just a conservative position. So I would probably get rid of the individual mandate. I’d allow people to buy into Medicare, the   public option, and I’d use Medicaid the way President Obama did. I think that was the most successful part of the bill. Alexander Bisley  Trump is the Republicans’ “chickens coming home to roost,” Bill Maher told me recently. “The problem is that they’ve been riding this tiger for a long time. Republicans have been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years,” Obama put it at the end of the 2016 campaign.     Howard Dean  I think that’s very accurate. When you feed your base anger and lies, eventually it’ll catch up with the feeder. And that’s what happened. Alexander Bisley People like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Mike Pence: These guys are similarly responsible? Howard Dean Sure, they all did it, or almost all of them did. There’s almost a total absence of moderate Republicans now. The stuff that Paul Ryan was saying about the health care bill was just   and nonsense. He and McConnell were making things up; that was the party line. I was shocked by what Ryan said about insurance. He didn’t appear to understand how it works. Alexander Bisley How does your party get through to swing voters who voted for Trump? Howard Dean First of all, I really do believe it’s time for my generation to step back and assume a coaching role. I think we need to get the young people of what I call the “first global generation” into politics. Trump may do it for them. This is a generation who doesn’t like establishment politics, they don’t like institutions because they find them clunky and slow, which they are, and they’ve remade the world in many ways without the help of institutions on an ad hoc basis.     I think the shock of the Trump win for them was, “Oh, gosh, you really do need institutions as clunky and slow as they are. ” Trump was an affront to the values of the younger generation, who value diversity, inclusion, respect for others, facts, and metrics. They’re not particularly left, and they don’t necessarily consider themselves Democrats, but they always vote for the Democrats because the Republicans are busy throwing red meat to their base, which includes excluding all the . .. first global generation’s friends.  I see this as a generation with less ideological bandwidth from left to right than ours, somebody who’s put the culture wars behind them, which our generation is still fighting. Young people who want to get stuff done and not just screaming, yelling, carrying on on television. That’s not going to benefit the country, and it’s because the Republicans have pushed so hard against the values of their own children. I think we’re going to see a huge change in politics as soon as that generation begins to take over the levers of power. Alexander Bisley What are some of your coaching tips? Howard Dean I think young people don’t quite understand that politics is a substitute for war and it’s a rough game. You don’t find nice people because the stakes are enormous, and people will do a lot of bad things to each other. Four hundred years ago, if we had a question on the succession of power, lots of people would’ve lost their lives. Instead, we essentially had a revolution in this country, and people didn’t lose their lives because we use elections instead. Politics is a substitute for war, and therefore you have to be tough, unyielding, and uncompromising in battle. That’s why the Republicans generally, with the exception of the two Obama campaigns, have run campaigns better.  They’ve survived a long time as a minority party. It’s a funny thing to say they’re a minority party, given their huge gains in the last eight years, but the truth is their views do not represent the views of most Americans on most issues, such as Social Security, Medicare, the right to have women make up their own reproductive decisions, and   rights, including marriage. Those are all positions that the Republicans have been left behind on. But they’re very clever, they’re incredibly disciplined, they understand that politics is like war, they’ve been methodical about getting what they want.  The younger generation isn’t like that at all. They aspire to a higher vision of what human beings are, and we’ll get there, but we’re not going to get there without breaking some glass. Alexander Bisley  Trump “believes truly insane, deranged and delusional things” Chris Hayes told me. “It’s very much an Infowars presidency in many ways. The president is a conspiracy theorist. ” What do you think?    Howard Dean  Well, I think the American people are smarter than most writers and intellectuals give them credit for. Richard Nixon had a 24 percent favorability rating the day he left office a disgrace. So there’s going to be 24 percent of the people who are going to believe whatever they believe, and they don’t care what the facts are.  But I think there are a lot of people who thought Trump really might be somebody who would turn the country around, so they were willing to forgive his craziness. Now I think they’re not, because it looks like he probably can’t do the job as a result of his mental problems. Alexander Bisley To be human is to have regrets. Do you have any particular political regrets? Howard Dean Well, yes, I didn’t win in 2004. It would’ve been great to be president; we might’ve saved ourselves a lot of trouble. We would’ve been out of Iraq earlier, we would’ve had a more equitable economic system, we would’ve had universal health care a long time ago. That’s assuming I could’ve had a Congress that I wanted. But remember, these campaigns are like war, and they’re very tough. I actually think if you can’t get through the campaign then you probably shouldn’t be president. And I didn’t get through the campaign.  Alexander Bisley  What about the most recent presidential campaign? You told MSNBC the Democratic National Committee “should never have taken sides”  —   do you have any regrets from that one?  Howard Dean Well, I regret Hillary didn’t win. I always like to teach my classes that there’s one instrument that’s incredibly popular among both physicians and politicians because they use it twice as much as anybody else: the retrospectoscope. The retrospectoscope is always correct. I try not to do too much looking in the rearview mirror. You want to do enough of it to learn, but you don’t want to do enough of it to fundamentally undermine what your values are.     Alexander Bisley  Okay, but is there a particular learning from the last campaign you’d emphasize? Howard Dean  I think the thing we learned about the most was that America was not quite ready to elect a woman president; we’ve got a ways to go there. But we did make a crack in the ceiling, and I think it’s very important.  Alexander Bisley  What has changed the most in American politics since 2004? Howard Dean  I think what’s changed the most is the ability to run technical campaigns with metrics. What we did was very crude compared to where people are today. While it was invented by the left, mostly by the kids on my 2004 campaign, the right has now taken up technology and actually surpassed us in their ability to use it. Alexander Bisley  What did you think would change but hasn’t? Howard Dean  I’m not sure. I think someday we’ll get away from the reliance on the   crazy stuff, otherwise known as fake news, and the Breitbarts, and all that. But I don’t think that’s at hand now; the Russians are using that as an international weapon. I’m a little surprised it hasn’t gone away sooner. I think until this next generation gets into politics, I don’t see major cleaning up of the place. I think the partisanship is going to continue for a while, and fake news and all this other destructive stuff is going to stay as long as my generation is in politics. There’s technology that my generation knows how to use but doesn’t know what it really means. Alexander Bisley  “Washington is the last place in America that has any idea about what the hell is going on,” you told Katie Couric recently.     Howard Dean That’s true. I always call it middle school on steroids. They’re all wrapped up in their own little bubble, and they don’t really understand what’s going on elsewhere. The Republicans know what the anger is, and then they exploit it. The Democrats, I don’t think they understand what people really want. The Republicans understand what people want; they just don’t want to give it to them because it requires some rearranging and tough choices. People want to live in a fair society where if they work hard, they have a shot. Since about 2000, that hasn’t been the case.   I think the moral leadership in the business community has fallen apart for the most part. When I was young, businesses integrated their boardrooms before they had to, and they actually were fairly  . Now I think there’s an appalling lack of concern sometimes in the boardroom of multinational corporations. After all, their allegiance is to multinational shareholders, not necessarily [to] the United States. There are some exceptions  —   for example, Starbucks and all those companies that made Mike Pence back off his   bill.   They really came through in North Carolina. Who ever thought the NCAA would come through on anything like that? Arizona refused to recognize Martin Luther King Day, so the National Football League forced them to do that. We need large corporations to use their influence. There are more that don’t do the right thing than there used to be. I think the business community needs to think seriously about where we’re going and not simply about what the next tax break is.             Alexander Bisley Matthew Yglesias wrote in Vox about how Deaniacs became Democrats and believes Sandersistas can do the same. Do you agree? Howard Dean  I do think it’s true, but it’s interesting what’s going on with the Sanders people because it went on with me in 2004 too. We divided into three groups. I told them when I was dropping out, I said, “You go to join your local Democratic Party. If they welcome you with open arms, then you’re part of the fabric of the party. If they try to keep you out, then you try to beat them in an election, which has happened. ” The Sandersistas have done that too; they have several state chairmanships.  I think what Sanders did was fantastic; it was great for the country and great for the body politic. However, there is a faction of Sanders people that I call “the sourpuss party” who don’t really want to win; they just want to be  . That always exists in humankind. They’d rather be on the sidelines and be right than get dirty and have to make some compromises. Bernie himself is not like that; he was quite a good mayor. He had to make compromises, he told his supporters so, and they had to like it. Whether it’s the right or the left, in every group there’s always people who believe that purity of ideology is more important than results. That’s not where I am on the political spectrum.    Alexander Bisley  What’s your relationship with Bernie like? Howard Dean  I think we like and respect each other. We’re not close, but I think what he did was good and he knows that I think he did was good. I went out of my way not to say anything that I thought was really destructive about him during the campaign even though I was supporting Hillary. I think he’s been a big addition to the country. Alexander Bisley  What do you think of the recent wave of nostalgia and goodwill for George W. Bush? Howard Dean  Look, I’ve always thought George W. Bush was an honorable person, although that doesn’t fit exactly with what happened in Iraq. My theory is that [Dick] Cheney manipulated him and controlled the amount of intelligence he was getting. But I know George Bush, I like him, he’s a great parent. I had some major problems with the war and some of his domestic policies, but as a human being I think it’s hard to dislike George W. Bush. Alexander Bisley In my opinion  —   and your opinion in 2003 and 2004  —   he certainly misled America into Iraq, which was and is horrendous, and had a lot of bad domestic policies too. Howard Dean  I agree with that. I didn’t support him for president; I don’t think he should’ve been president. I actually don’t think he was elected president. I think [Al] Gore should’ve gone and taken the next constitutional step, which was to ask Congress to make the decision, although the outcome might not have been different. I do not think [Bush] was a good president, but I do think he’s a good person. Alexander Bisley  Today some liberals even feel wistful toward the W years: Have the Republicans gotten more extreme since he was president?    Howard Dean The Republicans have gotten much more extreme. In the times of legislation, they’re just vindictive. It’s almost  ; their position on climate change, the purism on abortion, the hostility to people of color  —   which they may deny but then play to and   it. Trump didn’t even bother to   it; he just laid it out there. My parents were both Republicans; that’s not the Republican Party I grew up with in my house.  Alexander Bisley  What can a tiny state like Vermont do to challenge Trumpism? Howard Dean  We can do a lot. We were the first state in the nation to legalize   unions. We’ve had universal health care for people under 18 since 1992. There’s a lot of things we can do. I think one of the impressive things that Bernie did as mayor of Burlington was start the Burlington Community Land Trust, which was a way of allowing   people to stay in their own homes and to buy homes, and that’s been copied all over the country. A lot of our environmental stuff has been copied all over the country. Even small states can lead the way if they’re internally consistent and they have principles they believe in.  Here in Vermont, you get rewarded for telling the truth. I think what people loved about Bernie is that he wasn’t afraid to say things that everybody else is afraid to say that were pretty obvious. Bernie will win elections as long as he wants to here because his coalition is essentially the Trump voters and the lefties and the progressives.  I had my car   in my driveway this past summer. I got yakking about politics with the tow truck driver. As we’re putting the jumper cables on, he says, “You know what I’d like to see in politics? I’d like to see a   ticket. That’d give the big middle finger to all those people in Washington. ” Well, Bernie gets all those people up here. I think people here are pretty practical about the politics in Washington; they want somebody to go down there and shake the place up. Alexander Bisley Bernie seems to me like the John McCain of the left in that he’ll never retire.     Howard Dean  He’s a little more consistent than John McCain, but you’re right. Bernie’s independent; he’s not afraid of calling out his own side, which is important. Alexander Bisley  “Since his career in politics ended, Dean has found a home in the K Street establishment he once held in such disdain,” the New Republic’s Jonathan Cohn, a Deaniac, wrote in 2013. What’s your response? Howard Dean Jonathan Cohn wrote that? Alexander Bisley Yes. Howard Dean  He must have read the Intercept. That was a mistake [laughs]. I’m not a lobbyist. I do work at Denton’s, which is the largest law firm in the country, and I have a great time doing it. But I don’t lobby, I don’t work for clients I don’t particularly like, I don’t do billable hours; I do it my way. I have no intention of going to K Street. I must’ve missed that article, but I still think Jonathan Cohn is the best health care writer in the United States, bar none. Alexander Bisley  What do you hope your legacy is?  Howard Dean  There’s the Vermont legacy: what I did in Vermont in terms of balancing the budget,   marriage, health care, and that we blocked up hundreds of thousands of acres that’ll never be developed here because I wanted to preserve the character of Vermont long after nobody remembered who I was.  But the national legacy, the most important part of my legacy, is I think I was the first candidate to get the first global generation involved in politics. Alexander Bisley Despite Trumpism, you’re hopeful about their capacity to improve America and improve the world?    Howard Dean I have very little patience for people who whine and moan about millennials or the first globals, as I call them. I think this generation is absolutely extraordinary. Of course they have faults, but I think a lot of the criticism [from] older people about this generation [is] older people who are insecure about some of the things these guys are pointing out. This is a generation of human beings who have more power as individuals than any generation in human history. It’s unbelievable what they’ve done.  I know kids who are 28 years old who started foundations when they were 18. They’re changing more lives than USAID does, and there’s thousands of them. I think   education has been transformed by Teach for America and by the charter school movement. Nobody did anything about   education for 40 years  —   not white, not black, not Republicans, not Democrats, nobody.   Now we’ve got to get [more of] them into politics. They hate it, they don’t have any use for it  —   it’s too slow, it’s cumbersome, it’s full of   people that are unattractive  —   but it’s going to have to happen. And they’re going to change it. The problem is they’ve never wanted to get [into politics]. Now I think they understand why they have to do it, and that’s my great hope for the salvation of the world.  Alexander Bisley  You came up during the ’60s and ’70s, so you would’ve known young leftists who were more annoying than the odd fool on campus today. Howard Dean  You know that’s true. Here’s the great thing about this generation from my point of view: They have our values, but they’re much more   much more willing to work with each other, much more pragmatic, much less ideological, which is one of the more unattractive features of my generation in the ’60s.  Bernie’s left, but there’s not really much of a left in this country. I remember when there was a left  —   they were blowing up buildings, they were   as hell  —   and now there isn’t one. Now the right’s really unpleasant and doing crazy things. This generation has our values without having our rough edges and intolerance of others. I think that’s very important.     Now, there’s still a hell of a lot of work to be done. The race issue in this country still exists. I think before Ferguson, [Missouri,] my generation thought we were   and that’s not true: There’s a hell of a lot of work to be done. There’s not many nice things about getting old, but one of them is that I can look backward as well as forward. When Freddie Gray was killed, what you media were writing about was riots in the streets of Baltimore. When Martin Luther King was killed, 99 cities were burned down in the United States. What happened in Baltimore was barely a riot by our standards. Second of all, there were white kids out there protesting along with the black community; that never would’ve happened in the ’60s and the ’70s.  In 1968, King was killed, Bobby Kennedy was killed, the Chicago Convention blew up, and 99 cities were burned down. If you told us 40 years later we’re going to have a black president, we’d have told you you’re out of your mind, you’re smoking too much pot. Forty years later, Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. The amount of change in this country is unbelievable, but it’s not going to really accelerate until the first global generation takes their rightful place, which has been usurped by my generation. We’ve just stayed on a little too long, I think. Alexander Bisley also writes for Maclean’s, the Guardian, BBC, and more.  First Person is Vox’s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

"Honoring the world champion Cubs was a fitting final official act for Obama.  On a superficial level, what went down Monday at the White House was a      ceremony honoring another professional sports champion at the seat of American power. The president made some remarks. The team gave him a personalized jersey. They all smiled for the cameras. The players departed and tweeted from the bus on their way to the airport about how cool an experience it was. But circumstances being what they were, and the times being what they are, this was no normal ceremony. For beginners, those were the Chicago Cubs, still adorable and still adored by vast swaths of the nation  —   not to mention the West Wing  —   gathered there in the East Room on Monday afternoon. And that was President Obama, a South Side Chicagoan and avowed White Sox fan, gushing about the attributes of the rival North Siders standing behind him.  [Cubs win classic Game 7 to break   World Series drought]  And these are the final days of the Obama administration  —   Monday’s ceremony being his final official event  —   with the scaffolding and wooden stands already constructed a few steps from the White House for Donald Trump’s inauguration Friday. It had taken the Cubs 108 years to win a World Series title, and it took Obama about two seconds to break out the      jokes. “They said this day would never come,” Obama said, opening his remarks, as the crowd roared with laughter. “Here is something none of my predecessors ever got to say: Welcome to the White House, the World Series champion Chicago Cubs. . . . It took you long enough. And I’ve only got four days left. ”      (The Washington Post)   This was also Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Obama, the country’s first African American president, used that occasion to note that “there is a direct line from Jackie Robinson to me standing here. ” Diffusing the awkwardness of the   Sox rivalry  —   with first lady Michelle Obama, as her husband noted, being a   Cubs fan  —   was child’s play compared with the potential political tension. Though Trump’s name was never mentioned, his impending presence hovered over the ceremony. The Ricketts family, which owns the Cubs, is itself a political melting pot, with Todd Ricketts, Trump’s choice for deputy commerce secretary, flanking Obama on one side, and sister Laura Ricketts, a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton this election cycle, on the other side. In the audience were Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) Obama’s former chief of staff, as well as Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( .) and at least two Democratic congressmen from Illinois. In the front row, former top Obama campaign strategist and senior adviser David Axelrod  —   wearing a   beneath his suit jacket reading, “  2016: Make Chicago Great Again”  —   sat beaming as he regarded third baseman Kris Bryant and first baseman Anthony Rizzo in the flesh. “There were a lot of sick days around here during the playoffs,” Obama said, citing an unnamed staff member who called in sick and then was seen on TV being interviewed about the Cubs from a bar. Breaking with the tradition of visiting the White House on the team’s next scheduled trip to Washington the following season, the Ricketts family had pushed through the Cubs’ visit to squeeze it in before Obama left office  —   piggybacking it onto the team’s fan festival in Chicago over the weekend. All but a handful of Cubs players attended, with starting pitchers Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester and John Lackey among the notable absences.  [Five things to remember about the Cubs’ memorable Game 7 victory]  Obama attacked the political awkwardness with humor. Speaking of Cubs General Manager Theo Epstein, who has now helped end an   World Series drought for the Boston Red Sox and a   drought for the Cubs, Obama managed to score a direct hit against his own party’s national committee.      (Gillian   Washington Post)   “He takes the reins of an organization that’s wandering in the wilderness and he delivers them to the promised land,” Obama said, then added the punchline: “I’ve talked to him about being DNC chair. ” Moments later, Epstein said the Cubs had granted Obama a “midnight pardon” for all his “indiscretions as a baseball fan. ” The Cubs also gave Obama a handful of gifts, including a lifetime pass to Wrigley Field  —   “” Obama noted, examining the pass  —   and one of the “W” flags that flies at Wrigley after a Cubs win, autographed by all the members of the team. Obama did, however, decline to put on the “44” Cubs jersey with which he was presented  —   Chicago pride only going so far. At the end of his remarks, Epstein pointedly thanked Obama for his “tremendous presidency” and for “the dignity and integrity with which you’ve served the country the past eight years. ” And at the end of what may have been the most extraordinary of the dozens of these ceremonies Obama has hosted, the outgoing president shook hands and posed for pictures, and the whole room broke into a spontaneous chorus of “Go, Cubs, Go. ” ",-0.5
"Yasiel Puig is out of Dodgers second chances. Recently, Yasiel Puig broke the silence of an otherwise quiet Dodgers clubhouse by talking loudly and with animation on his cellphone before hanging up to scream a lewd suggestion across the room to teammate Joc Pederson. So when the Dodgers describe Puig as more mature or in a better place, understand they are still grading on a curve. What they are not doing any longer, they insist, is being held hostage by his potential talent or popularity. The Dodgers plan to begin the season with Puig as their regular right fielder, but even as arguably his biggest supporter, manager Dave Roberts said, “My message to him was clear: If he is not performing or he loses his focus, he is going to create opportunities for others, but that is the way it is for everyone. ” That is not exactly true. Corey Seager or Justin Turner or Clayton Kershaw could stumble, and no one is taking their jobs. Puig is different. Not long ago, the Dodgers were marketing around him and were afraid of getting rid of him and seeing him blossom elsewhere. But his OPS has fallen every year from his breakout 2013 rookie campaign, from . 925 to . 740 last year. The Dodgers sent him to the minors last August, and say he returned with a better swing and attitude. This spring, Roberts insists, “Yasiel is in the best mental and physical state I have seen him. ” Puig is just 26 and has two years and $14 million left on his deal. Yet he is likely facing his last shot in Los Angeles with top prospect Cody Bellinger perhaps ready. Dodgers officials know their best rotation includes Julio Urias. But with perhaps only about 150 innings allocated for the    lefty, the Dodgers are leaning toward keeping him back in April and regulating his innings either in the minors or extended spring. The Dodgers considered shutting him down in midseason, but seem to feel stopping and restarting him would be a mistake. He eventually will slot in as the fourth starter behind Kershaw, Rich Hill and Kenta Maeda. For now, the most likely Nos.   to open the year are Brandon McCarthy and Alex Wood. Scott Kazmir has been slowed by a hip ailment. The Dodgers see   Ryu as a wild card. The lefty has made progress this spring, but he has in the past, only to be limited to one start over the past two years.",1.0
"How Do You Make the Fake NASA Documentary Operation Avalanche? Hire a Really Good Lawyer. 

Slide:  1 / of  1.
Caption: 
Lionsgate Premiere  Matt Johnson and Matthew Miller were flying home from the successful premier of their first film when they had an idea: Make a fake documentary about faking the Apollo 11 moon landing. They knew it would be almost impossible to pull off, but it didn’t matter. “As soon as I said it, Matt and I knew we had to do it,” says Johnson. Johnson and Miller were no strangers to faking things. Their debut film, The Dirties, was a fictional documentary about a school shooting that they made for $10,000 using real high schools as sets. But winning the Slamdance Film Festival grand prize doesn’t bring the kind of money needed to pull off fake a moon landing. “It wasn’t until we came up with the idea of doing it all for real that it became possible,” Johnson said. “Doing it for real” means just that. Johnson and Miller made Operation Avalanche, out now, at Johnson Space Center in Houston. They told NASA they were making a documentary, showed up wearing ’60s clothes, and surreptitiously shot a movie about two CIA agents who help the space agency by faking the Apollo 11 mission. But first they got a lawyer.  Johnson, who wrote and directed the film, was on the festival circuit with The Dirties and developing his idea for Avalanche when he heard about Escape From Tomorrow, a horror movie that director Randy Moore shot at Walt Disney World without permission. Johnson asked around and learned that the lawyers at Donaldson + Califf in Los Angeles successfully argued that the film was protected by the parody provisions of Fair Use. Johnson and Miller, who produced Avalanche, called Chris Perez, the lawyer who worked on Escape, and immediately hired him. “We said, ‘Let’s make this movie together,'” Johnson says. Perez said they could use anything they shot at NASA and archival footage of Stanley Kubrick, whom conspiracy theorists believe filmed the bogus landing. The result is a delightful film about two ambitious (if naive) CIA agents—Matt (Johnson) and Owen (Owen Williams)—trying to uncover a Russian spy at NASA, only to realize they can do more to help the government by faking a lunar mission that’s way behind schedule. Pulling a fast one on Uncle Sam may seem brazen for two guys with a $1 million loan, a crazy idea, and little else, but it wasn’t. Granted, having someone like Perez sign off on your movie gets you something called “errors and omissions” insurance, which protects the studio if someone sues. But Perez told the filmmakers they were on solid ground under Fair Use, which states that such a move is fine as long as it is creative, transformative of the source material and sparing in its use, and won’t adversely impact the market for the original work. The problem is, most filmmakers don’t know that, and most studios won’t back those who do. “The reason why it hasn’t spread much is because it’s easier [for studios] to say no,” Perez says. It’s easy to see why. Warner Bros. settled lawsuit about a copyright claim Mike Tyson’s tattoo artist made about Hangover Part II. A legal claim about concert footage delayed the festival debut of the Aretha Franklin documentary Amazing Grace. Neither case involved Fair Use, but that doesn’t make studios less wary. Other movies, like Muhammad Ali — The Whole Story, have made a successful case for Fair Use, but only after a legal fight. Lionsgate, which acquired the rights to Avalanche in 2014, understood the risk and wasn’t worried, Perez says. And despite seven days at NASA, just 20 minutes of footage made it into Operation Avalanche, which earned glowing reviews at its Sundance Film Festival premier. A few seconds of Kubrick’s visage made the cut, too. Still, the scenes helped shape the film’s narrative arc, and it’s exactly the type of thing Johnson worries too many filmmakers are afraid to use. He wants to change that. “The law and the legal side of our production is now actually a creative tool that we use,” he says. “As soon as you realize lawyers are making it their business to allow artists to do new things, then the world opens up to you.” As to NASA, well, the agency isn’t too happy. In a statement, it says the “the film project was misrepresented” to the Science and Entertainment Exchange and to NASA, which supports more than 100 films each year. “We are disappointed the filmmakers would exploit the openness and transparency of those involved,” the agency says. That might explain why no one at NASA accepted Johnson’s invitation to see the film when it played at South by Southwest.",0.0
"Andrew Puzder withdraws labor nomination, throwing White House into more turmoil.   Andrew Puzder, President Trump’s labor secretary nominee, withdrew from consideration Wednesday amid growing resistance from Senate Republicans centered primarily on Puzder’s past employment of an undocumented housekeeper. The collapse of Puzder’s nomination threw the White House into further turmoil just two days after the resignation of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, amid revelations that  Flynn had spoken repeatedly, and possibly illegally, with the Russian ambassador last year about lifting U. S. sanctions. Puzder’s fate amplified the deteriorating relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill, where bipartisan support grew Wednesday for expanded investigations into ties between Trump, his presidential campaign and Russian officials. The White House, including Trump, offered no comment on Puzder’s withdrawal nor any indication of whom the president would nominate in the restaurant executive’s place. Puzder issued a statement saying he was “honored” to have been nominated. “While I won’t be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team,” he said. A top Trump campaign supporter, Puzder had attracted widespread criticism regarding his business record and personal background. He was set to testify Thursday at a confirmation hearing that had been delayed for weeks to allow for the completion of an ethics review of his vast personal wealth.      (Peter   Washington Post)   Critics have railed against Puzder’s positions against   increases and more generous overtime benefits. Some have also accused him of sexism, pointed to a rancorous divorce that involved   allegations of domestic abuse as well as racy TV ads run by his restaurant chains that featured scantily clad women eating hamburgers. But it was Puzder’s hiring of an undocumented worker for domestic work  —   as well as his support for more liberalized immigration policies  —   that pushed several Senate Republicans away, they said. Puzder had told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions this month that he had been unaware of the housekeeper’s immigration status when he hired her and that he paid federal and state back taxes after terminating her employment. Similar revelations have forced Cabinet nominees to withdraw dating to at least Bill Clinton’s presidency, but it was less clear this year, in the unpredictable,   era of Trump, whether that norm would apply. In the end, the revelation was particularly troubling to lawmakers because of the job Puzder was seeking: running the Labor Department. Sen. Tim Scott ( . C.) a member of the Senate health committee, said Wednesday that revelations about Puzder’s personal employment practices gave him “serious concerns” that he had conveyed to Senate leaders. Three other GOP senators on the committee, Susan Collins (Maine) Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) had also publicly voiced doubts. In the hours before Puzder withdrew, 12 Republican senators “at a minimum” were withholding support, according to a senior Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid political retribution. The quick erosion of support compelled Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) to tell the White House on Wednesday that Puzder lacked the support needed to survive, according to two senior Senate aides who requested anonymity. Shortly after that, Puzder withdrew. Senators may yet face another contentious confirmation vote Thursday, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( . C.) Trump’s nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is scheduled for a final vote on the Senate floor. On Wednesday, Mulvaney lost the backing of Sen. John McCain ( .) who objects to Mulvaney’s support for military spending cuts.     How long Cabinet confirmations take  —   and why past nominees failed View Graphic     How long Cabinet confirmations take  —   and why past nominees failed   [Trump’s pick for budget director just lost a crucial backer in the Senate]  Puzder has spent much of his career in the restaurant industry speaking out against wage and labor regulations. The former commercial trial lawyer has been a staunch opponent of rules finalized by the Labor Department last year  —   and since put on hold  —   that would have expanded the number of people eligible for overtime pay. He also has been critical of substantially increasing the minimum wage, arguing that it could push companies to cut jobs and encourage businesses to invest more money in automation. As a result, Puzder’s nomination immediately came under intense scrutiny from unions, labor groups and consumer advocates who worried the executive would prioritize businesses over workers. As recently as this week, workers from his   chain and advocates for a higher minimum wage marched outside of CKE’s restaurants to protest the nomination. Worker advocates had also   petitions to senators’ local offices and organized trips for CKE employees to travel to Capitol Hill and share their grievances with senators.  [Watchdog group working to unseal Puzder’s divorce records before his confirmation hearing ]  Democrats cheered Puzder’s withdrawal and sought to take credit for helping pressure Republicans to withdraw support. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) called Puzder’s decision “a victory for the American worker. Puzder should never have even been nominated to lead the Labor Department, and Senate Republicans clearly recognized this, too. ” He called on Trump to nominate someone who “champions workers’ rights rather than suppresses them. ” Progressives and Democrats said they hoped Trump’s next pick for labor secretary would be someone with a clear willingness to speak up for disadvantaged workers. “We need a labor secretary in the mainstream who supports the workplace protections that he or she would be charged with enforcing  —   and who cares about workers,” said Emily Martin, general counsel for the National Women’s Law Center, which opposed Puzder’s nomination because of “sexist” advertising run by Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s  —   two of Puzder’s restaurant chains  —   and reports of harassment from employees working for the chain. Several names that had emerged on Trump’s shortlist for labor secretary late last year began recirculating Wednesday. Among them: Rep. Lou Barletta ( .) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. After Puzder’s withdrawal Wednesday, Walker tweeted: “The future is too bright in WI for me to do anything other than being Governor. ” Puzder would have been the first labor secretary since the Reagan era to take the job without some experience in public service. He made a minor foray into politics in 2011, when he served as an economic adviser and spokesman for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who recently endorsed his nomination. In 2016, Puzder was an avid Trump supporter. In addition to serving as an economic adviser to his campaign, he and his wife, Deanna Puzder, contributed a total of $332, 000 to Trump’s bid, joint fundraising committees and to the Republican National Committee, according to the Federal Election Commission. Senators often do not weigh in on a nominee publicly until after a confirmation hearing, but Republicans have been mostly in lockstep to support Trump’s top Cabinet nominees. Only one other pick  —   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  —   drew as much public wavering among Republicans before his hearing, when five GOP senators expressed doubts. Ultimately, all of them voted for Tillerson. Beyond the committee where Puzder was scheduled to appear Thursday, three other Republicans  —   John Thune (S. D.) Rob Portman (Ohio) and Thom Tillis (N. C.)  —   publicly expressed concerns about his nomination. Thune’s hesitancy was notable because he is the   Senate Republican and responsible for helping to build support for   GOP causes. He told reporters Wednesday that he wanted to know more about why Puzder employed an undocumented housekeeper and how he paid her. Tillis cited the same concerns to reporters. Collins and Murkowski also voted against Betsy DeVos, Trump’s choice for education secretary, forcing Vice President Pence to become the first vice president to cast a tiebreaking confirmation vote for a Cabinet member. Both senators are among several who had seen footage of a 1990 “Oprah Winfrey Show” episode in which Puzder’s former wife appeared in disguise to describe allegations of domestic violence. The health committee requested that Winfrey’s production company provide copies of the episode for senators to review. Puzder has always denied the allegations, and his   recanted the accusations in 1990 when the couple reached a   agreement at the time of their divorce and again in a letter to senators last month. Aides said before Puzder’s withdrawal that Portman was still reviewing his history and did not want to weigh in yet, but the senator represents a state where labor unions were building support against the nomination. Portman won reelection last year with the endorsement of several labor unions, a rare feat these days for a Republican.  [Oprah Winfrey’s TV network provided footage of interview tied to Andrew Puzder’s labor secretary nomination]  Another blow to Puzder’s chances came on Wednesday morning when the conservative National Review announced its opposition. The publication cited Puzder’s past support for increased levels of legal immigration for   or seasonal workers  —   a position at odds with Trump’s calls for limited legal immigration. The magazine’s editors acknowledged “the impulse of the White House and the Senate to try to bulldog through rather than to give obstructionist Democrats a scalp. ” But, they wrote, “The country, and the administration, can weather a redo on this one. ” The National Restaurant Association  —   which had marshaled members across the country to help Puzder  —   called his withdrawal “extremely unfortunate. ” “Andy Puzder would have made a great labor secretary,” said Cicely Simpson, the group’s executive vice president. “We hope that President Trump’s next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy. ”  Paul Kane and Ashley Parker contributed to this report.

"Israel passes bill retroactively legalizing West Bank settlement homes. JERUSALEM  —    Israel’s parliament has passed a contentious law meant to retroactively legalize thousands of West Bank settlement homes. The law passed   in a   vote Monday. The law is expected to be challenged in Israel’s Supreme Court and is likely to face legal hurdles. The law retroactively legalizes several thousand homes built illegally on private Palestinian land. The original landowners would be compensated either with money or alternative land, even if they do not agree to give up their property. The international community overwhelmingly opposes settlements and sees them as an obstacle to peace. The law is part of a series of   steps taken in recent weeks by Israel’s   government, which has been emboldened by the election of U. S. President Donald Trump.",1.0
"A celebration of the natural hairstyles of black kids.      Photographer Emily Stein‘s young neighbors, children in a black family, were being chastised at school for having hairstyles that were “too colorful. ” “[It] struck me as upsetting and something I wanted to celebrate,” she said via email. So she and an assistant ran all over the streets of London to create a photographic appreciation of black children’s myriad hair sculptures. The pair would dash after children sporting a creative hairstyle, ask the parents’ permission to take a photo, and then quickly tape up a sheet of brightly colored paper as a backdrop. “I try to make the experience really fun for the kids   …     and I’m pretty immature and over excitable, so I don’t think kids find me intimidating,” she said. Stein let the children take the lead and select their own poses. Some were shy and tried to hide from the camera. Jahmari, the boy with the   fade, hit pose after pose like a professional model. “I hope that people who look at the series would feel the positive energy of youth and the spirit of undiluted individuality,” she said.

"Hiroshima survivors want Obama to apologize. But the Japanese government probably doesn’t..  Terumi Tanaka was 13 when the atomic bomb exploded a mile and a half from his Nagasaki home. He was knocked unconscious but survived, protected by several hills between him and the epicenter.    Five members of his family were not as fortunate. He remembers finding the charred bodies of his aunt and cousins outside their home; another aunt was severely burned, and when she died several days later, he and his mother cremated her themselves in a nearby field. Tanaka, like many hibakusha, or atomic bomb survivors, has strong and complicated feelings about President Obama’s historic visit to Hiroshima this week  —   the first by a sitting US president. Speaking to a small group of journalists, Tanaka, now 84 years old, said he wants the president to meet with survivors and ”acknowledge that the US committed a crime against humanity and against international law.” Shizuka Kamei, who lost his sister in Hiroshima and went on to become a powerful, conservative cabinet member, was more direct, telling a group of journalists: ”If President Obama’s not coming with an apology, he should not come at all.”    But while many Japanese survivors might want President Obama to apologize for the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the Japanese government might actually prefer that Obama not apologize.    Indeed, Japan’s vice foreign minister, Mitoji Yabunaka, reportedly told US Ambassador John Roos that ”President Obama visiting Hiroshima to apologize for the atomic bombing during World War II is a ‘non starter,’” according to a 2009 State Department cable released in 2011 by WikiLeaks. So why in the world wouldn’t the Japanese government want the US to apologize for inflicting such a horrendous tragedy on Japan? It turns out there are two reasons:    1) It would put pressure on Japan to apologize in kind An apology from President Obama could make Prime Minister Shinzo Abe feel compelled to offer his own apology for Japan’s wartime atrocities, including the ”Rape of Nanking” in China and massacres of ethnic Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore —   which, according to Yuki Tanaka, a professor at Hiroshima City University I spoke with, were perpetrated in part by soldiers from Hiroshima. ”Obama apologizing would bring up the issue of Japan apologizing, which is something Mr. Abe desperately wants to avoid,” Michael Cucek, an adjunct professor at Temple University’s Japan campus, told me in an interview. Already, a group of more than 300 Hiroshima peace activists are calling on the prime minister to join Obama in apologizing for the ”grave war crimes [both] nations committed.”    Abe has long resisted such mea culpas, saying Japan needs to end its ”masochistic” feelings of guilt. In December, he apologized for Japan’s use of Korean ”comfort women” as sex slaves during the war, but afterward he returned to his ”time to move on” refrain, telling reporters, ”We should not drag this problem into the next generation.” The same issues are now surfacing in Hiroshima. When the bomb fell there, tens of thousands of Koreans were working on the ground as forced laborers, and an estimated 40, 000 to 50, 000 were killed. Last week, a group representing Korean survivors called on both Obama and Abe to apologize and wrote to Obama, ”We hope your visit to Hiroshima will not be used to further the Abe government’s intention of painting Japan merely as a victim.” Tanaka, the history professor, said Japan could avoid such accusations of whitewashing if it followed Germany’s lead and explored its own culpability. That country takes the responsibility so seriously there’s even a German word, Vergangenheitsbewältigung, to describe coming to terms with one’s past. ”If you go to the Holocaust museum in Berlin, you always see groups of students engaging in discussions,” Tanaka said. ”You go to Hiroshima and there’s no discussion, only victimization.” 2) It could inflame a   domestic debate over nuclear power  —   and nuclear weapons An apology from Obama for using nuclear weapons on Japan ”could open up a can of worms” about Japan’s own nuclear program, Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, told me when we spoke recently. Since the disaster at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, Prime Minister Abe has worked hard to contain a vocal   movement in Japan. On the fifth anniversary of the disaster, he reaffirmed his commitment, saying Japan ”cannot do without” nuclear power.    Japan now has the largest stockpile of separated plutonium of any country that isn’t a nuclear power, according to the Wall Street Journal. And that’s emboldened some war hawks: ”If Japan wanted to develop nuclear weapons, it could do it almost immediately,” former Tokyo governor and military   Shintaro Ishihara told a group of journalists last week. ”And why shouldn’t Japan have its own?” With North Korea testing nuclear weapons just a few hundred miles away, that view might be gaining traction. In April, shortly after Donald Trump mused in the New York Times about the possibility of abandoning the US nuclear commitment to Japan’s security and encouraging Japan to develop its own arsenal instead, Abe issued a statement saying that the Japanese constitution does, in fact, allow for the development and use of nuclear weapons. ”This is a government that is not ruling out owning and using a nuclear weapon, so an apology at Hiroshima is going to make things awkward,” said Sophia University’s Nakano. Nakano said Abe also sees a political opportunity in Obama’s visit, which comes just ahead of Japan’s summer elections, and doesn’t want to spoil that with apologies. There is already an upper house election scheduled, but, as the Japan Times reports, Abe may get enough of a bump from Obama’s visit that he decides to call a lower house poll as well. If his party gets a majority in both houses, he’s pledged to go forward with changes to Japan’s pacifist constitution. Tanaka, the survivor who lost five family members, told reporters he thinks that’s the wrong direction for the country. ”Our constitution calls for the peaceful resolution of conflict. This is important to the survivors, and I think if we can share this idea with the world, it could become the global norm.” It’s a message he said he hopes to deliver to President Obama, whether or not the president offers an apology.

"Stephen Curry is trouncing LeBron off the court now too. Take that, LeBron James! NBA superstar Stephen Curry on Thursday again showed his unsurpassed leadership as he led sportswear maker Under Armour to a winning first quarter. Curry, who has led the Golden State Warriors to the   season record, helped Under Armour to a 64 percent spike in footwear sales in the three months ended March 31. Curry is the company’s No. 1 endorser and his    $129. 99 Under Armour Curry 2 kicks are among the hottest items in the US. By comparison, Nike’s LeBron XIII, the latest version of the NBA standout’s signature shoe, was discounted on the company’s site on Thursday from $200 down to $119. 97. “The Curry product has been full price since it was launched, while other brands have begun to discount,” said Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss, pointing to the Nike LeBron XIII line.  Other Nike signature shoes that have been discounted amid weaker sales in the wake of Curry’s rise include those pitched by Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant, say analysts.  Curry’s shoe is outselling them all  —   except Nike’s Air Jordan, which practically invented the   signature sneaker sector. Under Armour accounts for less than 5 percent of basketball sneaker sales. “No one is ever going to catch up to Jordans,” said Matt Powell, NPD Group’s sports industry analyst.  But Nike is not resting on its laurels. A month ago, it poached Under Armour’s senior vice president of design, Dave Dombrow, who helped oversee the Curry shoe launch. Under Armour’s stock, which effectively split    earlier this month when it issued nonvoting C shares, shot up 6. 8 percent on Thursday, to $46. 93.",1.0
"The Best Way to Test Students? Make Them Explain It On Video. As a physics professor, I have two jobs. The first, obviously, is to help students understand physics. That makes me something of a coach. But I want to talk about my second job: evaluating what students understand about physics. You might call this grading them. Evaluating a student's understanding of a topic is like taking a measurement. However, it requires measuring something that is difficult to see. It's not like I can stick a ruler into a student's brain to determine the size of their physics stuff. Now, most teachers use indirect means, usually a multiple-choice test or an exam in which students work through a problem. These are poor measures of student understanding. Someone could simply guess, or flub the answer through a silly mistake. ",0.0
"Tesla's Electric Cars Aren't as Green as You Might Think. Elon Musk is unveiling the Tesla Model 3 today. If you're planning to buy one, you’re probably feeling pretty good about yourself. Not only will you have a sweet ride, but you’ll be doing something good for the environment! No gasoline-powered sports cars to get you through your midlife crisis, thank you very much. You care about global warming. But how green is a Tesla, really? Devonshire Research Group, an investment firm that specializes in valuing tech companies, dug into the data and concluded that Tesla's environmental benefits may be more hyped than warranted. Devonshire isn’t saying that Tesla is pulling a Volkswagen, or that its cars are spewing greenhouse gases from invisible tailpipes. It’s arguing that Teslas (and, by extension, all electric vehicles) create pollution and carbon emissions in other ways. Each stage of an EV's life has environmental impacts, and while they aren't as obvious as a tailpipe pumping out fumes, that doesn't make them any less damaging. We can’t look at mining as an over-there thing and at Tesla as an over-here thing. They’re intricately linked. You can’t judge Tesla, or any other electric car, in a vacuum. You must compare it to the status quo. ",0.0
"I visit the world’s most dangerous countries for fun. Andy McGinlay   Barcroft Media Andy McGinlay   Barcroft Media Andy McGinlay   Barcroft Media Andy McGinlay   Barcroft Media Andy McGinlay   Barcroft Media View Slideshow This guy’s trips are the bomb! Scotland native Andy McGinlay, 34, has more than your ordinary sense of adventure when it comes to traveling. This bloke favors “extreme backpacking,” and it’s taken him to some of the world’s most unsafe (even tyrannical) areas, including North Korea, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. “I never feel more alive than I do when I step off the plane into some   war zone or despotic country,” McGinlay  —   a teacher based in Saudi Arabia  —   tells Barcroft Media. “It’s a dangerous cocktail of adrenaline and the sense that I’m going somewhere nobody else has the balls to  —   I live for this feeling. ” So far, McGinlay’s travels have taken him to 91 countries. He aims to hit 100 during his lifetime, which we sure hope isn’t cut short during one of these daredevil holidays. “After former President George W. Bush made his infamous ‘axis of evil’ speech, I knew right then that I had to visit every one of those countries  —   Iran, Iraq and North Korea  —   and I did,” McGinlay tells Barcroft. He went to Iran in 2012, noting its border was harder to enter than North Korea’s. But while in Iran, it wasn’t difficult for him to wander into Iraq. “Many of these   dangerous countries do, in fact, turn out to be quite friendly and almost the opposite of our perception from Western media,” he says. “They receive so few visitors from the outside world, the tourists who do venture there are made to feel extra welcome. ” His experiences, though, aren’t always so rosy. While on a mountain hike in Kabul, Afghanistan, McGinlay recorded footage of people shooting at American Black Hawk helicopters. In Syria on a 2010 trip, he was arrested and interrogated over accusations of spying. Once, in New Delhi, he was kidnapped and taken to Kashmir, where his captors  —   who held him for 10 days  —   forced him to smoke opium. He was only 20 years old at the time. But adrenaline, thick skin  —   whatever it is that keeps him going  —   isn’t fizzing out anytime soon. “I’ve invested so much of my life into traveling, and there’s nothing else I would rather be doing,” he tells Barcroft, “so I expect to continue my journey long after the big 100 and well into the future. ”",1.0

"Chasen Shreve’s mystery collapse hangs over Yankees’ hope. TAMPA  —   You would not be surprised if I told you that as of Sept. 5 last year, Dellin Betances had the   ERA (1. 30) among the 148 relievers with at least 40 appearances, Andrew Miller was ninth (1. 65) and Aroldis Chapman was 14th (1. 79). But what if I told you Chasen Shreve was 16th (1. 86)? In that same timeframe, among relievers who faced at least 175 batters, Miller (. 145) and Betances (. 147) ranked   in batting average against and Chapman 17th (. 197). No shocker, right? But how about if I told you Shreve was actually better than Chapman at that point, eighth among relievers at . 177? Yep, for   of 2015, Chasen Shreve was a heck of a reliever and then, well, then he became something less than a batting practice pitcher. In his final nine appearances, Shreve allowed 22 of the 36 batters he faced to reach safely and four homered. After allowing seven of 33 inherited runners to score over his first 50 appearances, Shreve inherited 10 runners and eight scored, and he tacked a 16. 20 ERA on top of that, and a 1. 594 OPS against. The Yankees were   in those games, and Shreve was a major culprit as they barely hung on for a   spot. Unlocking what happened in the final month is an important issue for the 2016 Yankees. Because, yes, they have built this spectacular end game with Betances, Miller and Chapman. But the Yankees also arguably have the most rotation red flags of any team. So there are going to be lots of innings to cover by the bullpen. And that is before dealing with the strong likelihood Chapman is going to miss time at the start of the season due to a suspension under the new domestic abuse protocols. Now, remove Betances or Miller for even a short DL stint and suddenly think of the number of innings needed to be filled by a middle crew minus its two most trustworthy cogs from 2015  —   Adam Warren and Justin Wilson. Which is why the Yankees tried to enlist several relievers this season and  —      —   had a   agreement with Tommy Hunter before he failed their physical and the deal was squashed. “A bullpen is not three guys,” pitching coach Larry Rothschild said. “It is seven guys out there. It is going to be important this spring to find guys to fill the other roles. ” The candidates are familiar, as so many of those who failed to hold onto roles last year are back. There is a sense among the Yankee brass that too much was asked too soon from guys such as Nick Goody, Jacob Lindgren, Branden Pinder and Nick Rumbelow, and they should be better this year for the experience. But the only one with anything approaching a track record is Shreve, who in the first 65 appearances of his career (including his Braves debut in 2014) pitched to a 1. 64 ERA. And then   …     Rothschild said he may never have watched more tape on a player than Shreve’s   work without coming to peace with what went wrong. Brian Cashman said the internal detective work checking arm angle, velocity and spin rate showed no deviations. Shreve said this was the most he ever pitched in a season, which may have gotten him tired. He also said he started thinking about his mechanics too much and got away from just fixating on the target and throwing. There also was this: Shreve said Brian McCann saw he was tipping pitches. And McCann said, “As a hitter, I could have picked it up,” and the catcher said he thought many hitters did. No one wanted to say publicly what the problem was, but here is something: Of those four homers Shreve gave up in his final nine outings, three came on   fastballs  —   a pitch the lefty only used about 50 percent of the time. “It is 100 percent fixable,” McCann said. “Let’s not forget this guy was having an unbelievable season. ” The Yankees pen sets up so much better if Shreve can be a consistent component. Joe Girardi has said he does not want to use his Big Three together often as a way to always keep at least one fresh, but that only works if someone can handle the sixth   seventh effectively and be trusted with late tie games on the road. Shreve enters the leading candidate, his plus splitter making him more effective against righties than lefties and, thus, positioning him to be more than just a matchup reliever. But only if the    Shreve resurfaces. “You can’t let one month ruin you,” Shreve said. “I want to absolutely be the guy that this team can trust. ”",1.0
"The evolution of the Clint Eastwood hero, from the Man With No Name to Sully.  For 45 years  —   longer if you count his work as an actor  —   Clint Eastwood has been churning out gruff, efficient movies about gruff, efficient men:   stories of strong and silent heroes and antiheroes who do their work, mull their regrets, and live with the consequences. His heroes show up, get the job done, and then go about their business, hoping to leave the world a little bit better in the process.    Eastwood’s latest film, Sully, offers yet another protagonist in this mold: Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who in January 2009   a commercial jetliner in the middle of the Hudson River outside Midtown Manhattan after a catastrophic engine failure, managing to save the lives of all 155 passengers in the process.  It’s a sober, earnest film about the virtues of quiet competence. Sully may not be Eastwood’s final film, but in many ways it serves as a summary and reflection of Eastwood’s own Hollywood career  —   and a reminder of why he is one of cinema’s most important and enduring filmmakers. Eastwood’s filmography is focused on action and consequences Eastwood got his start working as an actor in the 1950s and ’60s, most notably in a trio of epic spaghetti Westerns by Italian director Sergio Leone. In those films, Eastwood played a gunslinger who rarely speaks and is never identified, known widely as the Man With No Name. Eastwood’s mysterious character was a stoic figure with a gift for violence and a finely tuned sense of justice and responsibility, more myth than man.     In the early 1970s, Eastwood would move behind the camera to direct his own films, and his work retained the same stoic sensibility. In High Plains Drifter, his second feature, Eastwood once again cast himself as a nameless gunfighter, the Stranger, who appears almost as an apparition, riding out of the desert haze toward the dusty mining community of Lago.    Eastwood’s Stranger is far from a typical upstanding hero: In the first few minutes of the film, he orders a bottle of whiskey, guns down a trio of men who threaten him, and pulls a woman off the street to rape her after she insults him. He’s a spirit of vengeance  —   literally, in this case, as the film’s final shot strongly implies that he is the resurrected embodiment of a marshal that the town’s leadership conspired to have killed. The movie serves as a revenge fable in which the town’s hypocrisy is exposed and the marshal’s killers are punished for their misdeeds. And while it is bloody and exhilarating, it offers more than easy genre thrills. Instead, the film complicates the idea of vengeance by casting it as an ugly, cruel force with no regard for common decency or social stability. Invariably, the movie suggests, it leaves one with the bitter taste of regret.     Yet High Plains Drifter doesn’t exactly suggest that vengeance is simply wrong  —   rather, that it isn’t as satisfying as one might hope, and that it always comes at a high cost. In the movie’s key exchange, as the locals are preparing to kill a band of marauders expected to launch an assault on the town, one of the townspeople asks Eastwood’s Stranger what happens after the bad men are killed. His reply: “Then you live with it. ” Then you live with it could serve as the thematic kicker to any number of Eastwood movies, and maybe to his entire oeuvre. His movies are about deeds and misdeeds, duty and justice, and how both individuals and society must learn to live with the consequences of their actions. Eastwood’s favored themes have evolved as he’s aged, but they remain remarkably consistent Eastwood would go on to make dozens more films after High Plains Drifter  —   from   thrillers and crime films to biographies and historical dramas, along with a number of Westerns, many of which would dwell on similar themes and motifs. More than a decade later, in Pale Rider, he once again cast himself as a nameless avenger who arrives in a small settlement to protect a group of decent villagers from violence and corruption. Like many of his films, it was a meditation on violence and honor, but also on men and masculinity, in which Eastwood appears as wilderness specter  —   a man in a preacher’s frock who turns out to be remarkably skilled at violence.    Pale Rider doesn’t do much to complicate its portrayal of violence, but it does offer an unusually anonymous and businesslike take on heroism. Eastwood’s unnamed Preacher is the movie’s protagonist, but also a catalyst for the community to take stock of itself and its true identity. His presence brings them together, giving them the strength to fight back. The specifics of his identity are unimportant: When one of the villagers asks who he is, really, Eastwood’s Preacher responds, “Well, it doesn’t really matter, does it?”  The same sense of grave duty and regret infused Eastwood’s 1992 revisionist Western Unforgiven. Arguably his best film, it offers yet another mournful look at the burden of violence and the cost of revenge. Once again, Eastwood stars as a famed gunman in the American West, but this time he’s retired, a reluctant gunslinger all too aware of how killing can weigh on a man’s heart.              The referential film serves as a kind of   retrospective for Eastwood, one that takes stock of both the Western as a genre and his own specific role as an action icon. And while it’s too much to call Unforgiven an apology, it is a movie that soundly rejects the thrilling and romantic notion of the   gunslinger, a notion that Eastwood himself helped create. In the years following Unforgiven, age and   would become new themes of Eastwood’s. In a series of thrillers  —   Absolute Power, True Crime, Blood Work  —   Eastwood cast himself as an aging professional (a cat burglar, a reporter, and a retired FBI profiler, respectively) caught in a web of crime and violence while trying to calmly finish out his life. Looked at one way, these films are little more than competent adult thrillers. But there’s something ruminative about all of these roles, each of which finds him playing an old man looking back on his sins and successes, judging the world and measuring his life.  Sully features a familiar Eastwood hero: the complicated man wrestling with his legacy  These days, Eastwood works mostly on what might best be described as middlebrow prestige films: the war stories of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima; a Leonardo DiCaprio —  starring biopic, J. Edgar; a drama about age and integration, Gran Torino; a tale of a decorated soldier in Iraq, American Sniper.  Not all of these movies are great cinema: Eastwood’s directorial drabness often drags down his films, and he sometimes struggles to focus his ideas. But the same stoic sense of age and grief and responsibility runs through these films as well. These are movies about complicated men that raise questions about violence and legacy and their weight on the psyche of both an individual and the society that individual represents.    Sully works very much in the same mode: It’s a portrait of an ordinary man who, in a moment, becomes an extraordinary hero  —   and who nonetheless worries that his legacy will be at stake. Tom Hanks plays “Sully” Sullenberger, the pilot who in January 2009 landed US Airways Flight 1549 in the middle of the Hudson River. The movie is framed by the government’s investigation into the crash, but its middle section is devoted to an extended recreation of the event itself. Shot in Eastwood’s typical workmanlike style, so sapped of color that it sometimes approaches black and white, the movie excels at capturing both the    drama of ditching the plane and the remarkable calm that Sullenberger and his crew displayed while making    decisions. The movie’s masterful depiction of the scene is eerily accurate to recordings and reconstructions of the crash, right down to the Sullenberger’s musing about the beauty of the Hudson just before the engines failed.              Eastwood’s efficient,    direction sometimes drains big scenes of energy, but here it imbues the sequence with a surprising tension; by underplaying the event, he renders it both real and surreal.             But Eastwood doesn’t just show us the cockpit; he tracks the frightened passengers, the   rescuers, the air traffic controller who tries to guide the plane toward an airport, as well as the New Yorkers who watched with fear as the plane flew low over the city and then celebrated Sully as a hero for keeping everyone alive. Through it all, Sully shrugs off the idea that he is somehow special: “I don’t feel like a hero,” he tells a TV news interviewer. “I’m just a man doing his job. ” Among other things, Sully functions as a rumination on Eastwood’s   career Sully isn’t a Western, and Sullenberger isn’t the Man With No Name, but in many ways this is the story Eastwood has always told: the quiet, competent protagonist who brings together the community by taking the difficult but necessary action  —   and who then wonders about what he’s done. The movie’s central conflict is between Sully and the government safety inspectors pushing the notion that he could have made it back to a runway, based on simulations that showed he could. In reality, that conflict is exaggerated: Although some simulations did show that the plane might have made a successful return, the government’s safety report judged Sully’s   decisions as correct.             But this fictionalized conflict gives the movie the opportunity to mull Sully’s own doubts about his decision and his performance, and to wonder how he will be remembered after four decades as a pilot. As Eastwood told Deadline Hollywood earlier this month, when he first looked into telling the story, “I didn’t know where the conflict was. So I read it and of course you get into it with the transportation board hearings and everything, but I realized that his career as he wanted to end it was suddenly put in the balance. ”    It’s hard not to see Sully as a way for Eastwood to reminisce on the end of his own    career, as yet another story about a hero who doesn’t talk much but efficiently gets the job done, and wonders whether he made the right decision. At 86, he’s made his choices, and lived his life  —   and now he’s trying to live with it. ",-1.0
"Barack Obama Talks AI, Robo-Cars, and the Future of the World.                       Scott Dadich: Thank you both for being here. How’s your day been so far, Mr. President? Barack Obama: Busy. Productive. You know, a couple of international crises here and there. Dadich: I want to center our conversation on artificial intelligence, which has gone from science fiction to a reality that’s changing our lives. When was the moment you knew that the age of real AI was upon us? Obama: My general observation is that it has been seeping into our lives in all sorts of ways, and we just don’t notice; and part of the reason is because the way we think about AI is colored by popular culture. There’s a distinction, which is probably familiar to a lot of your readers, between generalized AI and specialized AI. In science fiction, what you hear about is generalized AI, right? Computers start getting smarter than we are and eventually conclude that we’re not all that useful, and then either they’re drugging us to keep us fat and happy or we’re in the Matrix. My impression, based on talking to my top science advisers, is that we’re still a reasonably long way away from that. It’s worth thinking about because it stretches our imaginations and gets us thinking about the issues of choice and free will that actually do have some significant applications for specialized AI, which is about using algorithms and computers to figure out increasingly complex tasks. We’ve been seeing specialized AI in every aspect of our lives, from medicine and transportation to how electricity is distributed, and it promises to create a vastly more productive and efficient economy. If properly harnessed, it can generate enormous prosperity and opportunity. But it also has some downsides that we’re gonna have to figure out in terms of not eliminating jobs. It could increase inequality. It could suppress wages. Joi Ito: This may upset some of my students at MIT, but one of my concerns is that it’s been a predominately male gang of kids, mostly white, who are building the core computer science around AI, and they’re more comfortable talking to computers than to human beings. A lot of them feel that if they could just make that science-fiction, generalized AI, we wouldn’t have to worry about all the messy stuff like politics and society. They think machines will just figure it all out for us. Obama: Right. Ito: But they underestimate the difficulties, and I feel like this is the year that artificial intelligence becomes more than just a computer science problem. Everybody needs to understand that how AI behaves is important. In the Media Lab we use the term extended intelligence1. Because the question is, how do we build societal values into AI? Extended intelligence is using machine learning to extend the abilities of human intelligence. Obama: When we had lunch a while back, Joi used the example of self-driving cars. The technology is essentially here. We have machines that can make a bunch of quick decisions that could drastically reduce traffic fatalities, drastically improve the efficiency of our transpor­tation grid, and help solve things like carbon emissions that are causing the warming of the planet. But Joi made a very elegant point, which is, what are the values that we’re going to embed in the cars? There are gonna be a bunch of choices that you have to make, the classic problem being: If the car is driving, you can swerve to avoid hitting a pedestrian, but then you might hit a wall and kill yourself. It’s a moral decision, and who’s setting up those rules? The car trolley problem is a 2016 MIT Media Lab study in which respondents weighed certain lose-lose situations facing a driverless car. E.g., is it better for five passengers to die so that five pedestrians can live, or is it better for the passengers to live while the pedestrians die? Ito: When we did the car trolley problem2, we found that most people liked the idea that the driver and the passengers could be sacrificed to save many people. They also said they would never buy a self-driving car. [Laughs.] Dadich: As we start to get into these ethical questions, what is the role of government? Obama: The way I’ve been thinking about the regulatory structure as AI emerges is that, early in a technology, a thousand flowers should bloom. And the government should add a relatively light touch, investing heavily in research and making sure there’s a conversation between basic research and applied research. As technologies emerge and mature, then figuring out how they get incorporated into existing regulatory structures becomes a tougher problem, and the govern­ment needs to be involved a little bit more. Not always to force the new technology into the square peg that exists but to make sure the regulations reflect a broad base set of values. Otherwise, we may find that it’s disadvantaging certain people or certain groups.  Ito: I don’t know if you’ve heard of the neurodiversity movement, but Temple Grandin3 talks about this a lot. She says that Mozart and Einstein and Tesla would all be considered autistic if they were alive today. Obama: They might be on the spectrum. Ito: Right, on the spectrum. And if we were able to eliminate autism and make everyone neuro-­normal, I bet a whole slew of MIT kids would not be the way they are. One of the problems, whether we’re talking about autism or just diversity broadly, is when we allow the market to decide. Even though you probably wouldn’t want Einstein as your kid, saying “OK, I just want a normal kid” is not gonna lead to maximum societal benefit. Obama: That goes to the larger issue that we wrestle with all the time around AI. Part of what makes us human are the kinks. They’re the mutations, the outliers, the flaws that create art or the new invention, right? We have to assume that if a system is perfect, then it’s static. And part of what makes us who we are, and part of what makes us alive, is that we’re dynamic and we’re surprised. One of the challenges that we’ll have to think about is, where and when is it appropriate for us to have things work exactly the way they’re supposed to, without surprises? Dadich: When we’re talking about that extended intelligence as it applies to government, private industry, and academia, where should the center of that research live, if there even is a center? Ito: I think MIT would argue that it should be at MIT. [Laughs.] Historically it probably would have been a group of academics with help from a government. But right now, most of the billion-dollar labs are in business. Obama: We know the guys who are funding them, and if you talk to Larry Page or others, their general attitude, understandably, is, “The last thing we want is a bunch of bureaucrats slowing us down as we chase the unicorn out there.” Part of the problem that we’ve seen is that our general commitment as a society to basic research has diminished. Our confidence in collective action has been chipped away, partly because of ideology and rhetoric. The analogy that we still use when it comes to a great technology achievement, even 50 years later, is a moon shot. And somebody reminded me that the space program was half a percent of GDP. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but in today’s dollars that would be $80 billion that we would be spending annually … on AI. Right now we’re spending probably less than a billion. That undoubtedly will accelerate, but part of what we’re gonna have to understand is that if we want the values of a diverse community represented in these breakthrough technologies, then government funding has to be a part of it. And if government is not part of financing it, then all these issues that Joi has raised about the values embedded in these technologies end up being potentially lost or at least not properly debated. Dadich: You bring up a really interesting tension that Joi has written about: the difference between innovation that happens in the margins and the innovation that happens in something like the space program. How do we make sure the transmission of all these ideas can happen?   Obama: I’ve tried to emphasize that just because the government is financing it and helping to collect the data doesn’t mean that we hoard it or only the military has it. To give a very concrete example: Part of our project in precision medicine is to gather a big enough database of human genomes from a diverse enough set of Americans. But instead of giving money to Stanford or Harvard, where they’re hoarding their samples, we now have this entire genetic database that everybody has access to. There is a common set of values, a common architecture, to ensure that the research is shared and not monetized by one group. Dadich: But there are certainly some risks. We’ve heard from folks like Elon Musk and Nick Bostrom4 who are concerned about AI’s potential to outpace our ability to understand it. As we move forward, how do we think about those concerns as we try to protect not only ourselves but humanity at scale? Obama: Let me start with what I think is the more immediate concern—it’s a solvable problem in this category of specialized AI, and we have to be mindful of it. If you’ve got a computer that can play Go, a pretty complicated game with a lot of variations, then developing an algorithm that lets you maximize profits on the New York Stock Exchange is probably within sight. And if one person or organization got there first, they could bring down the stock market pretty quickly, or at least they could raise questions about the integrity of the financial markets. Then there could be an algorithm that said, “Go penetrate the nuclear codes and figure out how to launch some missiles.” If that’s its only job, if it’s self-teaching and it’s just a really effective algorithm, then you’ve got problems. I think my directive to my national security team is, don’t worry as much yet about machines taking over the world. Worry about the capacity of either nonstate actors or hostile actors to penetrate systems, and in that sense it is not conceptually different than a lot of the cybersecurity work we’re doing. It just means that we’re gonna have to be better, because those who might deploy these systems are going to be a lot better now. Ito: I generally agree. The only caveat is that there are a few people who believe that there is a fairly high-percentage chance that a generalized AI will happen in the next 10 years. But the way I look at it is that in order for that to happen, we’re going to need a dozen or two different breakthroughs. So you can monitor when you think these breakthroughs will happen. Obama: And you just have to have somebody close to the power cord. [Laughs.] Right when you see it about to happen, you gotta yank that electricity out of the wall, man. Ito: What’s important is to find the people who want to use AI for good—communities and leaders—and figure out how to help them use it. Obama: Traditionally, when we think about security and protecting ourselves, we think in terms of armor or walls. Increasingly, I find myself looking to medicine and thinking about viruses, antibodies. Part of the reason why cybersecurity continues to be so hard is because the threat is not a bunch of tanks rolling at you but a whole bunch of systems that may be vulnerable to a worm getting in there. It means that we’ve got to think differently about our security, make different investments that may not be as sexy but may actually end up being as important as anything. What I spend a lot of time worrying about are things like pandemics. You can’t build walls in order to prevent the next airborne lethal flu from landing on our shores. Instead, what we need to be able to do is set up systems to create public health systems in all parts of the world, click triggers that tell us when we see something emerging, and make sure we’ve got quick protocols and systems that allow us to make vaccines a lot smarter. So if you take a public health model, and you think about how we can deal with, you know, the problems of cybersecurity, a lot may end up being really helpful in thinking about the AI threats. Ito: And just one thing that I think is interesting is when we start to look at the microbiome. There’s a lot of evidence to show that introducing good bacteria to fight bad bacteria—to not sterilize—is a strategy. Obama: Absolutely. I still don’t let Sunny and Bo5  lick me, because when I walk them on the side lawn, some of the things I see them picking up and chewing on, I don’t want that, man. [Laughs.] Ito: We have to rethink what clean means, and it’s similar whether you’re talking about cybersecurity or national security. I think that the notion that you can make strict orders or that you can eliminate every possible pathogen is difficult. Dadich: Is there also a risk that this creates a new kind of arms race? Obama: I think there’s no doubt that developing international norms, protocols, and verification mechanisms around cybersecurity generally, and AI in particular, is in its infancy. Part of what makes this an interesting problem is that the line between offense and defense is pretty blurred. And at a time when there’s been a lot of mistrust built up about government, that makes it difficult. When you have countries around the world who see America as the preeminent cyberpower, now is the time for us to say, “We’re willing to restrain ourselves if you are willing to restrain yourselves.” The challenge is the most sophisticated state actors—Russia, China, Iran—don’t always embody the same values and norms that we do. But we’re gonna have to surface this as an international issue in order for us to be effective. Ito: I think we’re in a golden period where people want to talk to each other. If we can make sure that the funding and the energy goes to support open sharing, there is a lot of upside. You can’t really get that good at it in a vacuum, and it’s still an international community for now. Obama: I think Joi is exactly right, and that’s why we’ve been convening a series of meetings with everybody who’s interested in this. One thing that we haven’t talked about too much, and I just want to go back to, is we really have to think through the economic implications. Because most people aren’t spending a lot of time right now worrying about singularity—they are worrying about “Well, is my job going to be replaced by a machine?” I tend to be on the optimistic side—historically we’ve absorbed new technologies, and people find that new jobs are created, they migrate, and our standards of living generally go up. I do think that we may be in a slightly different period now, simply because of the pervasive applicability of AI and other technologies. High-skill folks do very well in these systems. They can leverage their talents, they can interface with machines to extend their reach, their sales, their products and services. Low-wage, low-skill individuals become more and more redundant, and their jobs may not be replaced, but wages are suppressed. And if we are going to successfully manage this transition, we are going to have to have a societal conversation about how we manage this. How are we training and ensuring the economy is inclusive if, in fact, we are producing more than ever, but more and more of it is going to a small group at the top? How do we make sure that folks have a living income? And what does this mean in terms of us supporting things like the arts or culture or making sure our veterans are getting cared for? The social compact has to accommodate these new technologies, and our economic models have to accommodate them.   Ito: It’s actually nonintuitive which jobs get displaced, because I would bet if you had a computer that understood the medical system, was very good at diagnostics and such, the nurse or the pharmacist is less likely than the doctor to be replaced—they are less expensive. There are actually very high-level jobs, things like lawyers or auditors, that might disappear. Whereas a lot of the service businesses, the arts, and occupations that computers aren’t well suited for won’t be replaced. I don’t know what you think about universal basic income6, but as we start to see people getting displaced there’s also this idea that we can look at other models—like academia or the arts, where people have a purpose that isn’t tied directly to money. I think one of the problems is that there’s this general notion of, how can you be smart if you don’t have any money? In academia, I see a lot of smart people without money. Obama: You’re exactly right, and that’s what I mean by redesigning the social compact. Now, whether a universal income is the right model—is it gonna be accepted by a broad base of people?—that’s a debate that we’ll be having over the next 10 or 20 years. You’re also right that the jobs that are going be displaced by AI are not just low-skill service jobs; they might be high-skill jobs but ones that are repeatable and that computers can do. What is indisputable, though, is that as AI gets further incorporated, and the society potentially gets wealthier, the link between production and distribution, how much you work and how much you make, gets further and further attenuated—the computers are doing a lot of the work. As a consequence, we have to make some tougher decisions. We underpay teachers, despite the fact that it’s a really hard job and a really hard thing for a computer to do well. So for us to reexamine what we value, what we are collectively willing to pay for—whether it’s teachers, nurses, caregivers, moms or dads who stay at home, artists, all the things that are incredibly valuable to us right now but don’t rank high on the pay totem pole—that’s a conversation we need to begin to have. Dadich: Mr. President, what technology are you looking at to solve the biggest challenges that you see in government? Obama: There is a whole bunch of work we have to do around getting government to be more customer friendly and making it at least as easy to file your taxes as it is to order a pizza or buy an airline ticket. Whether it’s encouraging people to vote or dislodging Big Data so that people can use it more easily or getting their forms processed online more simply—there’s a huge amount of work to drag the federal government and state governments and local governments into the 21st century. The gap between the talent in the federal government and the private sector is actually not wide at all. The technology gap, though, is massive. When I first got here I always imagined the Situation Room would be this supercool thing, like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, where he’d be moving around stuff. It’s not like that, at all. [Laughs.] Particularly when it comes to hunting down terrorists on the other side of the globe, the movies display this omniscience that we possess somehow, and it’s—it’s just not there yet, and it has been drastically underfunded and not properly designed. In terms of the broader questions around technology, I am a firm believer that if we get climate change right, if we’re able to tap the brakes and figure out how we avoid a 6-foot rise in the oceans, that humanity is gonna figure stuff out. I’m pretty optimistic. And we’ve done a lot of good work, but we’ve got a long way to go. Figuring out how we regulate connectivity on the Internet in a way that is accountable, transparent, and safe, that allows us to get at the bad guys but ensures that the government does not possess so much power in all of our lives that it becomes a tool for oppression—we’re still working on that. Some of this is a technological problem, with encryption being a good example. I’ve met with civil libertarians and national security people, over and over and over again. And it’s actually a nutty problem, because no one can give me a really good answer in terms of how we reconcile some of these issues. Since this is a frontiers issue, the last thing I should mention is that I’m still a big space guy, and figuring out how to move into the next generation of space travel is something that we’re significantly underfunding. There’s some good work being done by the private sector, because increasingly it has displaced government funding on some of the “What the heck, why not?” ventures, the crazy ideas. When we think about spaceflight, we’re still thinking about basically the same chemical reactions we were using back in the Apollo flights. Fifty years later and it seems like we should—I don’t know if dilithium crystals7 are out there—but, you know, we should be getting some breakthroughs. Dadich: I understand you’re a Star Trek fan. That was a show inspired by a utopian view of technology—what about it shaped your vision of the future? Obama: I was a sucker for Star Trek when I was a kid. They were always fun to watch. What made the show lasting was it wasn’t actu­ally about technology. It was about values and relationships. Which is why it didn’t matter that the special effects were kind of cheesy and bad, right? They’d land on a planet and there are all these papier-mâché boulders. [Laughs.] But it didn’t matter because it was really talking about a notion of a common humanity and a confidence in our ability to solve problems. A recent movie captured the same spirit—The Martian. Not because it had a hugely complicated plot, but because it showed a bunch of different people trying to solve a problem. And employing creativity and grit and hard work, and having confidence that if it’s out there, we can figure it out. That is what I love most about America and why it continues to attract people from all around the world for all of the challenges that we face, that spirit of “Oh, we can figure this out.” And what I value most about science is this notion that we can figure this out. Well, we’re gonna try this—if it doesn’t work, we’re gonna figure out why it didn’t work and then we’re gonna try something else. And we will revel in our mistakes, because that is gonna teach us how to ultimately crack the code on the thing that we’re trying to solve. And if we ever lose that spirit, then we’re gonna lose what is essential about America and what I think is essential about being human. Ito: I totally agree—I love the optimism of Star Trek. But I also think the Federation is amazingly diverse, the crew is diverse, and the bad guys aren’t usually evil—they’re just misguided. Obama: Star Trek, like any good story, says that we’re all complicated, and we’ve all got a little bit of Spock and a little bit of Kirk [laughs] and a little bit of Scotty, maybe some Klingon in us, right? But that is what I mean about figuring it out. Part of figuring it out is being able to work across barriers and differences. There’s a certain faith in rationality, tempered by some humility. Which is true of the best art and true of the best science. The sense that we possess these incredible minds that we should use, and we’re still just scratching the surface, but we shouldn’t get too cocky. We should remind ourselves that there’s a lot of stuff we don’t know.

"Many LASIK patients may wind up with glare, halos or other visual symptoms, study suggests.      LASIK isn’t always as awesome as we might think. Millions of Americans each year undergo LASIK surgery to correct their vision. Given how common the procedure has become and how ubiquitous the ads are on radio and TV, you might be tempted to treat the decision to get the treatment pretty casually or think of it as purely a financial decision. A team of researchers from the Food and Drug Administration, the National Eye Institute and the Department of Defense would like to make sure you weigh the potential risks to your eyes more seriously. In 2009, as LASIK was becoming a household word, the government scientists launched a major study to investigate reports of adverse impacts from the procedure. At the time, there were a lot of anecdotes flying around but little scientific information about patient outcomes. The results, published in October 2014, showed that some patients developed problems that adversely affected their    lives, such as difficulty driving at night or in sunshine. But it was such a small number  —   less than 1 percent  —   of the patients in the study that it was difficult to draw any strong conclusions from that data. On Wednesday, the group released a   report in JAMA Ophthalmology that provides more sobering information. The study suggests that the percentage of people who undergo LASIK and wind up with new visual symptoms  —   such as double images, glare, halos or starbursts  —   may be much higher. The data was based on a questionnaire that looked at patient satisfaction with their vision and at visual and   symptoms following surgery. First, the good news. More than 95 percent of participants said they were satisfied with the improvements to their vision. In addition, the prevalence of   symptoms also decreased after surgery. The bad news is that a “substantial” percentage of the study participants said they had other, new symptoms following the procedure. The study analyzed outcomes for two groups of LASIK patients. In the first group, which included 262 Navy personnel with an average age of 29. 1, it was 43 percent reporting new symptoms. And in the second, consisting of 312 civilians at five practice and academic centers and with a median age of 31. 5, it was 46 percent. In addition, about 28 percent of patients who had never had   symptoms before developed mild, moderate or severe symptoms three months after the procedure. “To our knowledge, our study is one of the few that have reported the development of new visual symptoms,” Malvina Eydelman of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and colleagues wrote. “While the overall prevalence of visual symptoms decreased, a large percentage of participants with no symptoms preoperatively reported new visual symptoms postoperatively. ” One interesting component of this study was that the survey showed that the percentage of people with symptoms may be much higher than what has been previously reported in studies involving direct interviews with   professionals. The authors of the new study note that the reluctance of patients to tell their doctors about “negative” events has been well documented. The researchers cautioned that the study may not generalize to the LASIK population as a whole because of its small sample size and short   which was typically three months. However, they emphasized that “although the magnitude of the development of symptoms is uncertain, patients undergoing LASIK surgery should be adequately counseled about the possibility of developing new visual symptoms after surgery prior to undergoing this elective procedure. ” Read more: Blue light from tech gadgets and digital eyestrain: More than 73 percent of young adults suffer from symptoms Children’s sleeplessness may be linked to bedtime use of electronic gadgets      ",-0.5
"Breaking this dating app taboo pays off in a big way. Nevertheless they persisted. Online dating app Hinge has released evidence that texting the person you’ve matched with a second time significantly increases the chances of sparking a conversation. While double texting is stereotypically seen as a sign of being overly eager, data Hinge accumulated from analyzing 300, 000 conversations suggests that your odds of a response go from one in 500 if you’ve only proffered a solo opening line, to one in three. “I was really surprised,” says Molly Fedick,    of Hinge’s   “But people are very busy with their lives and may have several connections in their app, so they may take time to respond. If you’ve already matched with them, the mutual attraction is there. ” “Double texting almost always shows determination and a strong interest in the individual,” says Carmelia Ray, the   dating coach who stars as a matchmaker on Myx TV’s “Mom vs. Matchmaker. ” There are some limitations to Hinge’s insight since the data provided was only applicable to the mobile app. DC dating coach Erika Ettin says that double texting typically doesn’t work on   platforms like OKCupid. “Mobile apps also have much more activity while on a website, the messages are often longer,” she says. On those sites “you should assume they’ve read your message and if they don’t respond, they’re just not that into you. ” If you do double text, Hinge data suggests that you should only do so 3 hours and 52 minutes after you’ve sent your first message. But don’t worry if your match has temporarily slipped your mind: even those who double texted a week after initially reaching out were more than twenty times likelier to get a response than if they had left things alone.

"‘Band-Aid on a bullet wound’: What America’s new war looks like in Afghanistan’s most violent province.      CAMP SHORAB, Afghanistan  —   Earlier this month, a small district center just south of this desolate U. S. base came under attack from Taliban militants who threatened to overrun the local police. Frantic calls arrived from Afghan officials: They needed air support. In a U. S. command center, a steel hut of plywood walls and a dozen video monitors piping in drone feeds and satellite imagery, soldiers began directing aircraft to the area. Redhanded 53, the call sign for a      propeller plane loaded with sensors, arrived overhead just in time to watch a truck loaded with explosives slam into the main police station. [U. S. widens war in Afghanistan, authorizes new action against Taliban] Within an hour, the Americans had marshaled an armed Predator drone in the skies over the battle in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. But the commanding officer, Col. D. A. Sims, and his troops were unable to determine whether the men with guns on the ground were Taliban or Afghan soldiers. So Sims directed the Predator to fire one of its two hellfire missiles into an adjacent field  —   a $70, 000 dollar warning shot just to let the militants know that the Americans had arrived. The Oct. 3 battle is a microcosm of what is happening across Afghanistan: Taliban fighters that show enormous resilience despite being on the wrong side of a   $800 billion war; an Afghan army that still struggles with leadership, equipment, tactics and, in some units, an unwillingness to fight; and the world’s most sophisticated military reduced at times to pounding fields with its feared armaments. The future of the U. S. role in Afghanistan after a decade and a half of war has received little attention in the presidential campaign and debates. But the next administration will be bequeathed a strategy that is doing “just enough to lose slowly,” said Douglas Ollivant, a senior    fellow at the New America Foundation. Considered the birthplace of the Taliban  —   and the hub of the Afghanistan’s opium trade  —   Helmand is a   battlefield that runs deep with symbolism and blood. But despite a 2010 surge into the province by U. S. forces  —   the biggest military operation of the Afghanistan war  —   military reports now estimate that 85 percent of Helmand is controlled by the Taliban. “We’re like a   on a bullet wound,” one U. S. adviser said of the U. S. presence.    Col. D. A. Sims, commander of Task Force Forge looks out over Helmand province on Oct. 4. (Thomas    Washington Post)  ‘Holding the Helmand Line’ It is a scene that has played out continuously since the Obama administration surged 30, 000 troops into Afghanistan in 2009: U. S. forces torn between doing the Afghans’ job for them, or watching from the sidelines as they attempt to build a capable military from scratch. “The Army’s bringing security, and I’ll give them a   and they have a   because of the [airstrikes] we’re bringing,” said Army Col. Jeremy McGuire, the U. S. officer in charge of advising the Afghan military in Helmand. “It’s a passing grade. ”  The balance between assistance and dependence, though, has proved elusive, as advisers such as McGuire say that aiding the Afghans with airstrikes  —   once available only for the   of U. S. troops and Special Operations missions  —   has injected a new type of reliance on the U. S.  coalition. U. S. air support was a temporary measure approved by President Obama in June. On paper, it grants U. S. forces the ability to strike targets that will deliver “strategic effects” on the battlefield. In reality, the new strikes in Helmand were used to keep Afghan forces on “life support,” McGuire said. The airstrikes have also inadvertently encouraged Afghan security forces to continue relying on checkpoints rather than becoming more mobile. Their static approach damages their ability to counter the Taliban, according to the Americans. Frequently, U. S. strikes are used to keep a checkpoint from falling or after they do fall, to help the Afghans retake them. Despite a renewed dependency on U. S. forces, Afghan casualties are at unsustainable levels across the country. U. S. military documents show that in one week in August alone, more than 100 Afghan forces were killed, and nearly 300 were injured. The casualties, along with inconsistent leadership, has led, in some areas, to dangerously low morale in both the Afghan army and various branches of the police forces. The result is the almost daily abandonment of police and army checkpoints that are looted by the Taliban. Of the 540 checkpoints in Helmand, Afghan police have abandoned 112 of them, and the army has lost 30, McGuire said. The Afghans “are too spread out across too many checkpoints, but that’s the story in all of Afghanistan,” McGuire said. “The reason we’re probably staying alive is because we are keeping district centers and provincial capitals from falling, but that’s about all the assets we really have. ”     In 2011, at the war’s peak, the United States had more than 100, 000 troops in Afghanistan. Since then, it has slowly reduced its numbers. The remaining 9, 800 U. S. forces are spread across the country alongside their counterparts in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The United States is scheduled in 2017 to decrease the number of its troops to 8, 400  —   unless the next president decides otherwise. As U. S. forces draw down in 2017, the number of advisers here will increase from 25 to more than 100. The soldiers who do security for Camp Shorab will be replaced by civilian contractors, and in the spring, the U. S. Army’s mission in Helmand will rotate out to be replaced by a familiar presence in the province: the U. S. Marine Corps. “The Afghans ask every day for airstrikes,” McGuire said. “It kind of becomes old, especially when you can’t provide [them] five airstrikes. You can only provide one, and that’s if the [Taliban] is outside with an   shooting at someone. ” [U. S. soldier killed in Afghanistan was an ‘exceptional Green Beret’] As the Afghans hemorrhage casualties, lose ground and try to provide security for a handful of districts, the Americans in Helmand have become interlocutors for most of the parties involved  —   including the Army, the provincial governor and Helmand’s police chief, all while striking the Taliban and helping prepare Afghan units for another year of fighting. In Helmand, according to U. S. military officials, the situation could be better today had it not been for a decision at the end of 2014 to leave the Afghan Army unit covering the province  —   the 215th Corps  —   without any U. S. or NATO advisers. The decision, deemed “an acceptable risk” by the U. S. military, allowed what gains had been made by the unit since 2009  —   with a massive amount of U. S. support  —   to quickly disappear. According to one Corps adviser, the 215th suffered more than half of the Afghan security forces’ casualties in Afghanistan for all of 2015. Their casualties this year, though, are down 50 percent. In response to the 215th’s rapid degradation in the winter of 2015, the U. S.  mission in Afghanistan rushed in what is called an “expeditionary advising package,” a term of art for advisers needed to stave off disaster in some of Afghanistan’s more embattled regions. What started in February 2015 as seven advisers and four interpreters living alongside the 215th Corps’ leadership in the derelict remains of Helmand’s largest base has subsequently turned into what is now known as Task Force Forge with roughly 550 soldiers, civilians and contractors. Its motto: “Holding the Helmand Line. ”    Afghan commandos from the 7th Special Operations Kandak load up in their   helicopter to resupply a group of Afghan soldiers on Oct. 3. (Thomas    The Washington Post)  ‘They like to know there are Americans there’ Camp Shorab, located in Helmand’s desert and built among the ruins of two previous installations there, has grown into a base complete with a mess hall, showers, WiFi, a small post exchange and an   shop that sells souvenirs and haircuts. Even with Forge’s presence here and nearby Task Force Lethal  —   an American unit made up of an infantry battalion,   helicopters and gunships, stationed at Camp Dwyer  —   the 215th throughout this year has been able to conduct only   operations to clear parts of Helmand’s main    road, Route 601. Earlier in the year, the 215th had to give up two districts  —   Musa Qala and Nawzad  —   to the Taliban to start rotating units off the front lines for a   rest and refit. In recent weeks, Afghan forces also pulled out of the southern town of Khanashin to provide more security in Helmand’s capital, Lashkar Gah. The move was a welcome one by the U. S. forces because directing air cover to the southern district was becoming increasingly difficult. In Marjah  —   one of the cities that had some of the heaviest fighting when the U. S. Marine Corps was in Helmand in 2010  —   Afghan Army units have been forced to huddle in the town’s center. Roads in and out of Marjah are impassible because of roadside bombs, forcing the unit’s commander there to request that his forces be airlifted out, leaving behind their equipment, including U. S.  Humvees. Lashkar Gah has also been under attack since late August, with reports of Taliban militants getting closer to the city limits each day. Earlier this week, a   vehicle exploded in the city, forcing the Afghans to rush in 300 commandos to bolster its defenses. Currently, U. S. forces have an expeditionary advising package at the city’s adjacent airfield, and though that contingent was supposed to withdraw earlier this month, it will probably stay in place for the foreseeable future. Consisting of roughly 50 soldiers from Task Force Forge and a small contingent of advisers, the group is a “show of force” against the Taliban and a morale booster for the city’s residents. “They like to know there are Americans there,” one soldier said. “And they know Americans will defend their own. ” Yet for the nearly constant fighting across Helmand, the war can seem like a distant one at Camp Shorab. “The only thing we see of Afghanistan is what’s on these screens and outside that door,” Task Force Forge’s assistant operations chief, Capt. Chris Cummings, said, gesturing toward the entrance to his command center. [As U. S. air war over Afghanistan shrinks, a    for Afghan aircraft] The soldiers here  —   including elements of the first and second squadrons of the Army’s 3rd Cavalry Regiment, based out of Fort Hood, Tex. and some German soldiers  —   spend their days helping refuel aircraft, providing security for the advisers at the camp and standing through   posts in Shorab’s   emplacements. The nearby airfield, controlled by the Afghans, has to be secured every time a flight comes in, so the soldiers rush out in pickups and Land Rovers to ensure the planes’ passengers get off safely. The sentry positions, stocked with junior soldiers  —   some of whom had to look up Helmand province on the Internet before deploying  —   are the only evidence that Shorab is in a combat zone. The last time the base received any indirect fire was when another Army unit was standing up Shorab in the spring. Although the routine on the ground for the Americans is a mixture of security operations and training the Afghans, what happens in the sky is more complicated. With troop numbers a fraction of the war’s peak, getting aircraft over Helmand is a daily scheduling dilemma. Blocks of the day can be covered by myriad aircraft, some armed, others not. And while most of the aircraft are used to look for the Taliban, they also are employed to find Afghan security forces as their commanders are often unreliable at reporting where exactly they are located. By nightfall during the Oct. 3 battle, the Afghan army had secured much of the district center, called   . It had required American air power. After the warning shot into the field, Sims used the second hellfire missile on the drone to hit a vehicle surrounded by Taliban.   jets then killed at least two fighters with guided 2.  rockets that hit their targets as they ran down a goat path. Apache gunships also arrived to rake a handful of more militants with their 30 mm cannons. The Afghan commander eventually reported that he had lost 15 of his men and that seven were wounded. “We killed 12, and the Afghans lost 15,” one American officer said. “Does that count as a loss? Because it’s certainly not a win. ”    Soldiers, including an Army Green Beret, head back to their helicopters after a meeting between Afghan and U. S. military officials in Lashkar Gah on Oct. 4.

"The media loved Trump’s show of military might. Are we really doing this again?.  The cruise missiles struck, and many in the mainstream media fawned. “I think Donald Trump became president of the United States last night,” declared Fareed Zakaria on CNN, after the firing of 59 missiles at a Syrian military airfield late Thursday night. (His words sounded familiar, since CNN’s Van Jones made a nearly identical pronouncement after Trump’s first address to Congress.)  “On Syria attack, Trump’s heart came first,” read a New York Times headline. “President Trump has done the right thing and I salute him for it,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Bret Stephens  —   a frequent Trump critic and Pulitzer   conservative columnist. He added: “Now destroy the Assad regime for good. ” Brian Williams, on MSNBC, seemed mesmerized by the images of the strikes provided by the Pentagon. He used the word “beautiful” three times and alluded to a Leonard Cohen lyric  —   “I am guided by the beauty of our weapons”  —   without apparent irony. Quite the pivot, for some. Assessing Trump’s presidency a few weeks ago, Zakaria wrote that while the Romans recommended keeping people happy with bread and circuses, “so far, all we have gotten is the circus. ” And the Times has been so tough on Trump that the president rarely refers to the paper without “failing” or “fake” as a descriptor.      (Department of Defense)   But after the strikes, praise flowed like wedding champagne  —   especially on cable news. “Guest after guest is gushing. From MSNBC to CNN, Trump is receiving his best night of press so far,” wrote Sam Sacks, a Washington podcaster and journalist. “And all he had to do was start a war. ” Why do so many in the news media love a show of force? “There is no faster way to bring public support than to pursue military action,” said Ken Paulson, head of the Newseum Institute’s First Amendment Center. “It’s a pattern not only in American history, but in world history. We rally around the commander in chief  —   and that’s understandable. ” Paulson noted that the news media also “seem to get bored with their own narrative” about Trump’s failings, and they welcome a chance to switch it up. But that’s not good enough, he said: “The watchdog has to have clear vision and not just a sporadic bark. ” Clara Jeffery, editor in chief of Mother Jones, offered a simple explanation: “It’s dramatic. It’s good for TV, reporters get caught up in the moment, or, worse, jingoism. ” She added: “Military action is viewed as inherently nonpartisan, opposition or skepticism as partisan. News organizations that are fearful of looking partisan can fall into the trap of failing to provide context. ” And so, empathy as the president’s clear motivation is accepted, she said  —   “with no mention of the refugee ban keeping those kids out, no mention of Islamophobia that has informed his campaign and administration. How can you write about motive and not explore that hypocrisy?” Mocking “the instant elevation of Trump into a serious and respected war leader,” Glenn Greenwald in the Intercept recalled John Jay, one of the Federalist Papers authors, who wrote more than 200 years ago: “However disgraceful it may be to human nature . . . nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it. ” In fact, Jay wrote, “absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it”  —   except, of course, to scratch that eternal itch for military glory, revenge or  . Groupthink, and a lack of proper skepticism, is something that we’ve seen many times before as the American news media watches an administration step to the brink of war. Most notoriously, perhaps, that was true in the   to the Iraq invasion in 2003, the start of a long disaster there. Stephen Walt, Harvard professor of international affairs, thinks the press and the public should have learned some things by now. “Syria remains a tragedy because there are no good options,” he wrote in Foreign Policy, and America’s interventions in the Middle East very seldom end well. Walt later told me that the news media now must look forward and ask deeper questions. “What is Trump’s overall strategy for Syria,” given that “the balance of power on the ground is unchanged and we are no closer to a political settlement. ” Missile strikes may seem thrilling, and retaliation righteous. But journalists and commentators ought to remember the duller virtues, too, like skepticism, depth and context. And keep their eyes fixed firmly there, not on the spectacular images in the sky.

"Ikea's Slow and Steady Plan to Save the Smart Home. A year and a half ago, Ikea became a smart home company, introducing a line of connected light bulbs to complement its lingonberries. This spring, it adds its second product category to its Home Smart lineup: a set of smart blinds, called Fyrtur, that open and close with the tap of a wireless remote or a voice command. Blinds might seem an odd choice to build on Ikea’s IoT momentum. In fact, there’s no better sign that the company has a better grip on the smart home than just about anybody. Stories about the smart home tend to focus on the negative, and for good enough reason; how many other household items can be hacked by pranksters threatening nuclear war? But the problems associated with many connected devices belie that they can, in many instances, be genuinely useful. Take Ikea’s Trådfri LEDs, which focus on affordability and ease of use over flash. Or likewise its smart blinds, which exist explicitly to solve more problems than they create. Expect to see Ikea build out its smart home offerings selectively, and at a deliberate pace. ",0.0
"Explosions rock 2 Egyptian churches, killing dozens and injuring scores more.   TANTA, Egypt  —   Bombs rocked churches packed with worshipers in the Egyptian cities of Tanta and Alexandria on Sunday, killing at least 43 and injuring scores more. The assaults were the latest in a spate of attacks targeting Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority and come ahead of a scheduled visit by Pope Francis to Egypt.  The Islamic State claimed responsibility for both bombings through the Amaq News Agency, which is affiliated with the Islamist militant group. Egypt’s Christian minority, who make roughly 10 percent of the population, have increasingly been targeted by Islamist extremists.  Together, the bombings were the single deadliest day for the besieged community in decades. By Sunday night, President Abdel Fattah   had declared a state of emergency across the country for three months. The first bomb in Tanta, 80 miles north of the capital, Cairo, exploded around 9. 30 a. m. during a Palm Sunday service at St. George’s Church. The device, police said, was planted in the pews of the church.  “I ran to the church to find my lifelong friend shattered to pieces by the bomb,” said Mona Faiez, 61, who lives near the church and came running after she heard the blast. Her friend, Soliman Shaker, was a church deacon.   Relatives and onlookers gather outside the church in Tanta. The church was packed with worshipers for Palm Sunday services. (Nariman   )   “What kind of human could do this and why?”  Less than three hours later, a second blast erupted near Saint Mark’s Church in the northern city of Alexandria. The head of Egypt’s Coptic Church, Pope Tawadros II, was presiding over the Palm Sunday Mass at the church, but he was unharmed.  The Health Ministry said 43 people have been killed in the attacks, 27 in Tanta and 16 in Alexandria, but the death toll is widely expected to rise. It said 119 have been injured.  Both churches were packed for Palm Sunday services. After the attack in Tanta, photos appeared on social media, showing bloodstained walls and shattered wooden pews. Many of the dead were believed to be children, according to initial local media reports.  On Sunday, Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, denounced the bombings and expressed “his deep condolences” to Tawadros II and “all of the dear Egyptian nation. ”  In remarks made after celebrating Mass in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican, the pope asked God to “convert the hearts of those who spread terror, violence and death, and also the hearts of those who make, and traffic in, weapons. ”  President Trump tweeted, “So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U. S. strongly condemns. I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly. ”             Caption   Bombs explode outside the Saint Mark’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria and Mar Girgis Coptic church in Tanta during Palm Sunday Mass.

"This vegan took her hatred for poultry to the extreme. A Georgia driver purposely crashed into a truck filled with live chickens  —   because she’s “a vegan,” according to reports. Judith Armstrong, 26, was cruising down the highway in her red   sedan about a     ago when she spotted the truck and decided to smash into it,  . The rattled truck driver slammed on the brakes, but Armstrong wasn’t done  —   she slammed into the vehicle again and spun in front of it, cutting it off. The animal advocate fled the scene as the truck driver pulled over to call 911, the TV station reported. At first, efforts to track her down seemed impossible because authorities only had a vague description of her appearance and vehicle. But Madison County deputies soon realized she “clucked” up, leaving parts of her car  —   including her license plate  —   at the scene. Cops tracked her down at her home, where she spoke to deputies through the window, refusing to leave until a search warrant was produced. She finally admitted to the deed, telling cops “she was a vegan and hit the truck due to it being a chicken truck,”  .  Major Jeffrey Vaughn from the Madison County Sheriff’s office said the chickens had just been picked up from a local farm and Armstrong was looking out for the safety of the birds. “She was protecting the life of those little baby chickens  …     she thought,” Vaughn told The Post. “Unfortunately, they were en route to a processing plant. ”   Vaughn said no chickens were injured in the accident and the truck was also undamaged.  Armstrong was suspected of being drunk during the accident, but told officers she didn’t drink before the crash and had “a couple of shots” only after she arrived home. Armstrong was also suspected of drunken driving, but told officers she didn’t drink before the crash, but did have “a couple of shots” after she arrived home. Officers got a warrant and arrested Armstrong on charges of    aggressive driving, driving under the influence and obstruction. She was released on a $5, 250 bond. ",1.0
"Venezuela is on the brink of a complete economic collapse.    Customers line up to enter a   Bicentenario supermarket in Caracas, Venezuela. (Jorge  )  The only question now is whether Venezuela’s government or economy will completely collapse first. The key word there is ”completely.” Both are well into their death throes. Indeed, Venezuela’s ruling party just lost congressional elections that gave the opposition a   majority, and it’s hard to see that getting any better for them any time soon  —   or ever. Incumbents, after all, don’t tend to do too well when, according to the International Monetary Fund, their economy shrinks 10 percent one year, an additional 6 percent the next, and inflation explodes to 720 percent. It’s no wonder, then, that markets expect Venezuela to default on its debt in the very near future. The country is basically bankrupt. That’s not an easy thing to do when you have the largest oil reserves in the world, but Venezuela has managed it. How? Well, a combination of bad luck and worse policies. The first step was when Hugo Chávez’s socialist government started spending more money on the poor, with everything from   gasoline to free housing. Now, there’s nothing wrong with that  —   in fact, it’s a good idea in general  —   but only as long as you actually, well, have the money to spend. And by 2005 or so, Venezuela didn’t. Why not? The answer is that Chávez turned the   oil company from being professionally run to being barely run. People who knew what they were doing were replaced with people who were loyal to the regime, and profits came out but new investment didn’t go in. That last part was particularly bad, because Venezuela’s   crude needs to be blended or refined  —   neither of which is cheap  —   before it can be sold. So Venezuela just hasn’t been able to churn out as much oil as it used to without upgraded or even maintained infrastructure. Specifically, oil production fell 25 percent between 1999 and 2013. The rest is a familiar tale of fiscal woe. Even   oil prices, as Justin Fox points out, weren’t enough to keep Venezuela out of the red when it was spending more on its people but producing less crude. So it did what all poorly run states do when the money runs out: It printed some more. And by ”some,” I mean a lot, a lot more. That, in turn, became more ”a lots” than you can count once oil started collapsing in  . The result of all this   as you can see below, is that Venezuela’s currency has, by black market rates, lost 93 percent of its value in the past two years. It turns out Lenin was wrong. Debauching the currency is actually the best way to destroy the socialist, not the capitalist, system.    Source: dolartoday. com  Now you might have noticed that I talked about Venezuela’s black market exchange rate. There’s a good reason for that. Venezuela’s government has tried to deny economic reality with price and currency controls. The idea was that it could stop inflation without having to stop printing money by telling businesses what they were allowed to charge, and then giving them dollars on cheap enough terms that they could actually afford to sell at those prices. The problem with that idea is that it’s not profitable for unsubsidized companies to stock their shelves, and not profitable enough for subsidized ones to do so either when they can just sell their dollars in the black market instead of using them to import things. That’s left Venezuela’s supermarkets without enough food, its breweries without enough hops to make beer, and its factories without enough pulp to produce toilet paper. The only thing Venezuela is   with are lines. Although the government has even started rationing those, kicking people out of line based on the last digit of their national ID card. And it’s only going to get worse. That’s because Socialist president Nicolás Maduro has changed the law so the   National Assembly can’t remove the central bank governor or appoint a new one. Not only that, but Maduro has picked someone who doesn’t even believe there’s such a thing as inflation to be the country’s economic czar. ”When a person goes to a shop and finds that prices have gone up,” the new minister wrote, ”they are not in the presence of ’inflation,’ ” but rather ”parasitic” businesses that are trying to push up profits as much as possible. According to this  —   let me be clear  —   ”theory,” printing too much money never causes inflation. And so Venezuela will continue to do so. If past hyperinflations are any guide, this will keep going until Venezuela can’t even afford to run its printing presses anymore  —   unless Maduro gets kicked out first. But for now, at least, a specter is haunting Venezuela  —   the specter of failed economic policies.       ",-0.5
"5 Jets draft takeaways: Hackenberg is Maccagnan’s turning point. We won’t know for several years how the Jets did during this year’s draft, but this feels like a pivotal moment for general manager Mike Maccagnan. The move to take quarterback Christian Hackenberg in the second round out of Penn State could be a huge plus or minus on Maccagnan’s record eventually. Hackenberg gets the headline, but there were some other interesting moments in this draft for the Jets. Here is a look at five takeaways from this year’s Jets draft: Hackenberg took over the headlines on Friday night, when the Jets  . This is a polarizing pick that has some people scratching their heads and others praising Maccagnan’s bold move. The bottom line is this is what Maccagnan was hired for last year. Tired of cap experts Mike Tannenbaum and John Idzik running his team, owner Woody Johnson went out to find a scout to run his team. Maccagnan has been praised for his eye for talent. This draft pick will either make him look like a genius or look clueless. It was a risky pick for sure. While Hackenberg could be the Jets’ quarterback of the future, he is not the quarterback of the present. The Jets need to get Fitzpatrick signed for the 2016 season. That did not change with the draft picks. The Jets linebacking corps grew old and slow over the past few years. This season it will have a totally new look. Only veteran David Harris will be back in the starting lineup. Erin Henderson will be the starter next to him with Lee getting plenty of playing time in sub packages. On the outside,   player Lorenzo Mauldin is expected to start on one side and Jenkins will be competing for the starting job opposite him with a few unproven veterans. A profile is starting to emerge of a Maccagnan draft pick. One thing that has become clear is he likes players from the major conferences. This year only one of the seven picks came from a lesser conference and that was punter Lachlan Edwards of Sam Houston State. The Jets took two players each from the Big 10, SEC and ACC. If you add the 2015 draft to this year’s, only two of 13 picks came from   conferences. Last year, he grabbed a player from the   Big 10, ACC, Big 12 and SEC before taking   pick Deon Simon from Northwestern State. Maccagnan also likes younger players. His first three picks this year are all 21 years old.",1.0
"LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner Announces Plans to Step Down. The last three and a half years haven’t been so great for social media platforms. They’ve been accused of fomenting genocide, breaking Western democracies, and abetting mass shooters. The CEOs have sweated in front of Congress, meditated deep in the forests, and deleted the very apps that made them billionaires. Amid this drama, Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, has been like a man whistling as he bikes safely beside the century’s craziest car crash. His company has quietly grown, gained influence, and avoided acrimony. The worst that people generally say is that it’s all been pleasantly boring. And so it’s fitting that on Wednesday, Weiner is stepping into a new role in a calm, sensible transition, seemingly designed to make as few waves as possible. He’s announcing that, after 11 years running the company, he will become executive chair in June. His replacement will be Ryan Roslansky, a senior vice president of product at the company who was the first person Weiner hired. Tomer Cohen, another VP of product, gets Roslansky’s role. It’s all very ordered. Asked how he planned to alter Weiner’s vision of the company, Roslansky said that, actually, he was fully on board with Weiner’s vision. “I didn’t take this role to change the company. I took it because I couldn’t believe more in what we’re doing,” Roslansky told WIRED. Weiner, for his part, somehow explained his departure as the result of too much love for his current job. “It just felt like the right time. I had always thought to myself that I’d be in the role for as long as I was happy, and then I realized I love this place so much, and our sense of purpose, our vision, has become so inextricably linked with my own sense of purpose,” he said. LinkedIn was a network, but it wasn’t really social, when Reid Hoffman, the company’s founder, hired Weiner in 2008. It was mainly just a job board. You created an account, buffed up your career history, connected your address book, and then forgot about it. But gradually, largely through projects that Roslansky oversaw, it evolved into a platform with different communities. People post essays and updates. Recruiters scour the résumé pile. Marketers post their ads. And, yes, occasionally jerks get it confused with Tinder. Throughout, the company’s origins shaped its tone and its culture. People’s identities were tied to their résumés, which meant that they acted like their bosses were always looking. This decreases racist shitposting and increases the colloquial use of PowerPoint clichés. The company went public in 2011 at a valuation just over $4 billion and then did something very unusual. It froze product development for two months while the engineering team rebuilt its entire tech stack. Once unfrozen, the product could scale. In 2015, through a project led by Roslansky, the company spent $1.5 billion to buy the online learning platform Lynda. By 2016, roughly three-fifths of LinkedIn’s revenue came from recruiters, with the rest split mainly between advertising and individuals paying for premium accounts. Microsoft must have liked the mix and bought the company for $27 billion. Most large acquisitions of this sort go haywire in some way or another. The founders of Facebook’s two large purchases of that era—WhatsApp and Oculus—are long gone from the mother ship and have spent time throwing grenades into One Hacker Way. But Weiner stayed in his role, and everything proceeded apace. He reported up to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, whose compensation, as reported in Marker, was tied partly to how well LinkedIn did in making users return to the site. That isn’t to say that LinkedIn is never controversial and has never had a crisis. It continues to do business in China and to comply with the law there. It has algorithms that, like so many other algorithms, can be hacked. One telling moment came in 2017, when people began flooding the service with what BuzzFeed News beautifully called “Broetry.” Unlike its platform peers, LinkedIn wasn’t being accused of fomenting jihadism. But it appeared guilty of something nonetheless quite serious: empowering douchebags. A group of users had figured out that they could write short posts with lots of line breaks that would do exceedingly well in the algorithm. Their specialty was the zombie business school hustle content that appears too frequently on LinkedIn to begin with, this time formatted like Wallace Stevens. “A candidate failed the interview. I still hired her. Here’s why.” It was clickbait that cleverly took advantage of a bug in the system that gave more weight in LinkedIn’s feed algorithm to a post on which people took actions, including “click to read more,” which of course happened more on stories with line breaks. Posts of this sort were soon getting millions of views, encouraging more of them, and creating a feedback loop of banality. Every Friday, LinkedIn’s senior product managers meet at 10 am in California. At one such meeting around this time, according to someone present, Roslansky declared it was time to stop the Broetry. It made the engagement metrics go up; it might even have been good for the bottom line. People seemed to like the stuff, and you could run ads next to it. But it was accidental, garbage growth hacking. LinkedIn soon changed the algorithm to vanquish the Broets. At another meeting that year, according to Weiner, Roslansky took the initiative in the company’s decision to no longer allow political ads. According to one person who worked directly under him, Roslansky's style is to listen carefully, ask questions, and subtly guide the organization to decisions. A typical question he asks is, ""If we were starting from scratch, is this how we would build this product?"" Microsoft doesn’t offer many details about LinkedIn’s finances, but it’s growing steadily. According to the company’s most recent financial report, LinkedIn’s revenues grew from $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $2.1 billion in the last quarter of 2019. The generous way to put it is that revenue increased by 24 percent. The less generous way to put it is that Microsoft still earns slightly more revenue off Bing. Weiner says simply, “The company has never been stronger.” In his new job as executive chair, Weiner says he wants to work on a project that he discussed in depth at the WIRED25 conference this past fall: changing LinkedIn so that it doesn’t reinforce network bias. A platform that offers everyone’s résumé to everyone else should, theoretically, democratize work. But over the past few years, Weiner has become deeply worried about the ways his platform reinforces biases. It’s easy to connect on the platform with people who went to the same school as you or who have friends in common. To whom much is given, even more will be given still. There’s no topic that seems to inspire Weiner more, and he is happy to detail his company’s efforts to reverse the bias. For one, it now eagerly connects people in nonprofit organizations with people on the platform. If you volunteer for the Boys and Girls Club, LinkedIn will make it easy for members of the organization to connect with you. The company also asks users to take the “Plus One Pledge” and to bring people outside of their networks inside. And perhaps most important, the company now requires that engineers check, whenever algorithmic changes are made, who might benefit disproportionately and who might be harmed in an unintentional way. It’s an important project, and not an easy one—reflected perhaps in the fact that Weiner himself has just chosen his closest colleague as the next CEO. And, according to Weiner, it’s likely to be his central ambition as he moves into the executive chair’s role. The ideal, he said to me a few months back, is if “we can take these vicious cycles and turn them into virtuous ones.” Which isn’t a bad ambition for a social network, even one that’s mostly ordered and calm.",0.0
"Why Software Needs to Escape from San Francisco. Lately I've been hearing complaints from my techie friends about San Francisco. Sure, the city is a mecca for anyone who wants to build a startup—with ample capital, helpful angels, and some of the best software talent on the planet. But it's becoming a monoculture. “You go to dinner and tech is literally all people talk about: tech, tech, tech,” sighs my friend David Silva, an engineer who lived in San Francisco for five years before decamping for the East Coast.

"Southern Baptists are about to vote on a proposal to condemn ‘alt-right white supremacy’.           A Southern Baptist Convention proposal to condemn a white nationalist group drew some backlash during the convention’s annual meeting on Tuesday when a committee first declined to bring a proposed resolution to a vote. But Southern Baptist leaders worked on the language late last night, and the convention will vote Wednesday at 5:45 p. m. Eastern time on the resolution condemning the   movement  —   a small,   movement that seeks a   state. The debate over the resolution highlights the many divisions within the denomination around the election of President Trump, which put the spotlight on white supremacists among his supporters. While several Southern Baptist leaders have served on Trump’s evangelical advisory board, many younger Southern Baptists  —   including the denomination’s Ethics and Religious Liberty president Russell Moore  —   vocally opposed his candidacy.   [Southern Baptist churches threaten to pull funds after months of Trump controversy]   Many evangelicals of color have said they feel alienated by such high white evangelical support for Trump and have asked leaders to condemn those who support him who are racist. The Southern Baptist resolution was written by Dwight McKissic, a black pastor from Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington, Tex. who said he wanted the denomination to make it clear they had no sympathy for the  . “I saw people identifying themselves as Southern Baptist and members of the   so this is horrifying to me,” McKissic said. “I wanted the Southern Baptist Convention to make it very clear we have no relationship to them. I thought it would be a slam dunk, but I misread Southern Baptists apparently. ” Meeting in Phoenix this week, Southern Baptists voted on Tuesday to condemn gambling and Planned Parenthood, and they adopted a statement on the importance of public officials who display “consistent moral character. ” That resolution also commended “those leaders who choose not to meet privately with members of the opposite sex who are not their spouse,” referring to Vice President Pence, who drew attention when he said he doesn’t eat alone with a woman other than his wife. Discussion broke out Tuesday over the   resolution after a committee that brings resolutions to a vote declined to do so, a move that drew attention from   leader Richard Spencer. Last night, Moore and Steve Gaines, the president of the SBC, worked with the committee to shape the language of the proposal so it could be voted on today. Moore and Gaines declined to comment on the resolution before it came to a vote. Moore said, however, that he was encouraged by Tuesday’s decision to revisit the resolution. “They recognize that white supremacy in this   guise is dangerous and devilish and we need to say something,” Moore said. The initial text of the resolution called on Southern Baptists to “reject the retrograde ideologies, xenophobic biases, and racial bigotries of the   ‘ ’ that seek to subvert our government, destabilize society, and infect our political system. ” The new text of the proposal noted some of the convention’s previous actions on race, including how Southern Baptists voted in 1995 to apologize for the role that slavery played in the convention’s creation and racism. It noted how in 2012 it elected its first black president. More than 20 percent of Southern Baptist congregations, it says, identifies as predominantly nonwhite. “Racism and white supremacy are, sadly, not extinct but present all over the world in various white supremacist movements, sometimes known as ‘white nationalism’ or ‘’” the resolution states. Southern Baptists “decry every form of racism, including   white supremacy, as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ” and “we denounce and repudiate white supremacy and ever form of racial and ethnic hatred as of the devil. ”    Barrett Duke, chairman of the 2017 Committee on Resolutions, answers questions at a news conference on Tuesday in Phoenix. (Angie  )  On Tuesday, resolutions committee chairman Barrett Duke told Southern Baptists gathered there that the resolution contained language that was “inappropriate” for an official SBC statement and did not define precisely who is a member of the   according to the Baptist Press. A call to Barrett Duke, chairman of the SBC’s resolutions committee, was not immediately returned. Duke told Religion News Service that the committee’s decision to not to bring the resolution forward for a vote on Tuesday was “not an endorsement of the  . ” “There are aspects of people who identify as the   certainly, a lot of their views and their intentions, we would adamantly, aggressively oppose,” Duke said. McKissic, who wrote the original resolution, declined to speculate over the motives for why the committee didn’t bring his proposal forward, but he said he was offended by Duke’s remarks and he felt his proposal was treated differently than the others the committee considered. He said black Southern Baptists were disappointed by how it was handled, but it became clear on Tuesday that a large number of white Southern Baptists wanted to vote on the resolution. There was a vote, but it needed a   majority and received a 57. 53 percent. Then the committee decided to revisit the resolution. “I don’t think they anticipated how white people would get upset about this and demanded something be done. I’m encouraged and heartened by this,” McKissic said. “It was the white people who said, no we will not take this sitting down. We don’t want this association with the convention. ” The Southern Baptist Convention has a long and complicated history on race, one that has recently gotten wrapped up in many Southern Baptists’ support for Trump. Some of the committee members are affiliated with National Religious Broadcasters and First Baptist Church in Dallas, institutions that are seen as friendly to Trump. In April, five white Southern Baptist seminary leaders posted a racially insensitive photo on Twitter with many of them dressed in hoodies and pointing as though they were holding guns. Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary’s Barry McCarty, who is chief parliamentarian of the SBC, was shown holding a gun. H. B. Charles, who was just elected the first black pastor to serve as the president of the next Southern Baptist pastor’s conference in Dallas in June 2018, said Tuesday’s resolution was another example of how the convention still has a long way to go on race. “If we had fumbled the ball and kept going without addressing this, it would have been damaging for those from the outside looking in, who could’ve concluded that the SBC does not care about matters of race,” Charles said. “I’m glad we picked up the fumble and are trying to address this before we leave. It could have had a really bad effect on our witness. ”    The Southern Baptist Convention of 15. 2 million members is the nation’s largest Protestant denomination, but its membership is on the decline. Attendance was down nearly 7 percent from the year before and baptisms were down 5 percent.",-0.5
"NASA is sending 6 strangers to Hawaii to practice living on Mars.  Before NASA sends humans to Mars, it has to figure out this really, really basic problem: How do you get six or more people to live in a very confined space, on a desert, without naturally occurring oxygen, for a year, without wanting to kill one another?     It’s ironic: NASA can successfully launch a rocket to Mars and land it, but if the crew hates their roommates, the mission will collapse.  This isn’t an abstract problem. In the past, simulated space colonies have gone horribly wrong. The   Biosphere II project in 1994 eventually split into warring factions that refused to speak to one another.        Related    The top 7 ways a trip to Mars could kill you, illustrated   That’s not ideal. So to prepare for an eventual Mars mission, NASA has been running simulations for the past several years on top of an isolated volcano in Hawaii.     The mission is called Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or   for short. On Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano, six “astronauts” live in a simulated Martian environment for eight months or more. The location resembles the geography of Mars, as you can see below.    Today, NASA and the University of Hawaii are launching the fifth round of the mission. This afternoon, Hawaii time, six participants will enter the facility for an   stay. (If this all sounds familiar, it’s because in August 2016, NASA completed the fourth round of the mission, which lasted for a year.) The new crew includes two women and four men. You can read more about them here.             On the mountain, they do everything an astronaut on Mars would do. Every time they go outside their tiny    habitat to conduct geological fieldwork, they have to don a spacesuit. Similarly, radio transmissions to “Earth” are delayed 20 minutes in both directions, just like they would be on the Red Planet. They eat only prepackaged,   space food. What fun.             If you’re thinking, “Who on Earth would want to spend eight months in a tiny tent with strangers,” know that 700 people applied to take part in the mission, as the Associated Press reports. (NASA also regularly recruits participants for a study where people are confined to a bed for months to simulate the effects of microgravity on the body. Vice sent a reporter to check it out. It sounds awful.)                        The hope of the mission, as principal investigator Kim Binsted explained to the AP, is “to figure out how best to select individual astronauts, how to compose a crew and how to support that crew on   space missions. ”    In the last round of the mission, NASA experimented with virtual reality to help alleviate loneliness, and gave the astronauts a VR headset so they could see their family eat a Thanksgiving meal together. It’s not home. But as National Geographic News reported, preliminary data suggests it helps.     On this mission, NASA and the University of Hawaii will be using virtual reality for   exercises “to predict individual and team behavioral health and performance and multiple stress. ” They also report, in a press release, that they will be continuously monitoring the facial expressions of the crew mates to gain better insights on what circumstances are optimal for cooperation. The studies are vital, because even the simulated Martian environment can be a lonely and frustrating place, as the New Yorker described last year:  The   crew members have not been immune to homesickness, or to the pressures of monotony and enclosed space. Sometimes one will schedule an E. V. A. just to take a walk outside, or will sneak into the attached supply container to record a private voice mail. The days proceed with little variety apart from the sound of wind or rain on the dome. After passing the midway point, the crew started joking   about what researchers call the “  phenomenon,” when energy sometimes flags. Monotony and boredom can be a threat to any expedition’s  .  …       …    The mind grows stressed, and makes mistakes, as it searches for new stimulus.   A mission to Mars has the potential to be a   lonely journey. And it’s not that NASA astronauts can just tough it out. Loneliness is increasingly seen as a risk factor for disease and mental decline. And these astronauts are going to need to be in peak mental and physical shape to make it through the journey. Because, as we’ve explained, at every turn it will be dangerous. ",-1.0
"Verizon&#8217;s Unlimited Data Plan Has Changed. Here&#8217;s How It Compares to Other Carriers. 

Slide:  1 / of  1.
Caption: 
Getty Images  This week, Verizon unveiled new unlimited data offerings for wireless customers. Unfortunately—for both consumers and those who insist on accuracy—none of its “unlimited” plans are actually unlimited. Verizon now has a few different “unlimited” choices: The cheaper Go Unlimited monthly plan, the more expensive Beyond Unlimited monthly plan, an option for business customers, and a prepaid option. These plans all place limits on video quality (480p or 720p, depending on the plan), and some of them place limits on the speed of your connection. Verizon’s previous unlimited data plan, which placed no limits on video quality but would throttle your bandwidth once you hit the 10GB-per-month mark, is no longer available to new customers. Verizon customers who have that older unlimited plan will be able to keep it, but they will also see their video quality limited to a maximum of 720p, just like everyone else on the network. Verizon famously launched its all-you-can-eat monthly plan in February. In doing so, it forced other carriers to restructure their own unlimited data plans to compete. This resulted in a net positive effect for consumer choice in cellular data. Since then however, Verizon has begun stepping back its offerings by forcing lower-quality video streams and imposing speed limits for its cheaper plans. It’s possible the other carriers will follow Verizon’s lead once again and start downgrading video (some already do) and being less generous with their data plans in general. Right now, all four major carriers—and some lower-priced virtual mobile networks—now have an unlimited data plan of some kind. There are major differences in terms of pricing, qualifications, and data-throttling. Here’s how they all shake out. Price: $75 per month and up
The fine print: The amount of 4G LTE data is unlimited, but your speed could be throttled at any time, no matter how much you’ve downloaded so far this month, if Verizon’s network is experiencing congestion. Whether the network is congested is entirely up to Verizon to determine. Video quality is limited to 480p on mobile phones and 720p on tablets. You can’t watch any 1080p video on this plan. Mobile hotspot capability is unlimited, but speeds are throttled to 600 kbps.
Best for: Mobile hotspot users and video junkies who don’t mind being stuck with DVD-quality streams. Price: $85 per month and up
The fine print: The amount of 4G LTE data is unlimited, but your speed could be throttled once you hit the 22GB mark for the month. Video quality is limited to 720p on phones and 1080p on tablets. Mobile hotspot capability is unlimited for the first 15GB, but speeds are throttled after that.
Best for: Mobile workers who rely heavily on tethering, and video streamers who gotta have their HD. Price: $70 per month and up
The fine print: AT&T’s cheapest unlimited plan gives you all the data you want at 3Mbps speeds until you hit the 22GB mark. After that, it could throttle your data speeds further during periods of congestion. Video is limited to 480p. Mobile hotspot capability isn’t part of the plan.
Best for: People who never tether and are OK with DVD-quality video. Price: $100 per month and up
The fine print: AT&T’s more expensive unlimited plan gives you all the data you want at unthrottled 4G speeds until you hit the 22GB mark. After that, you’re throttled during periods of congestion. Video streams in 720p. Mobile hotspots work at full speed for the first 10GB. After that, hotspots are throttled to 128kbps, which is throw-it-out-the-window slow, totally unusable. But hey, you get free HBO with this plan, just like a hotel room.
Best for: Those who insist on HD video, tetherers, and Insecure addicts. Price: $70 per month
The fine print: The good news is that all taxes and fees are lumped into that $70 price, and you get a free hour of Gogo in-flight internet when you’re on a plane. You’ll need to sign up for auto-pay. If you use a ton of data every month (we’re talking the top three percent of data hogs), your speed may be throttled. In response to Verizon’s unlimited relaunch, T-Mobile added mobile-hotspot service and HD streaming to its own plan. Hotspots are limited to 10GB and 3G speeds, and videos “typically” stream in HD.
Best for: This still appears to be the best all-around deal. Plus, you’ll know exactly what you’ll be charged every month. Price: $55 per month
The fine print: You’ll need to activate auto-pay for that lowest price; otherwise it’s $60. Download speeds are capped at 8Mbps, which is slower than the US average. Just like other carriers, Cricket will throttle you further after you hit the 22GB mark for the month. Doesn’t include mobile hotspot capability.
Best for: Getting unlimited AT&T data coverage at a much lower price. Price: $50 per month and up
The fine print: You’ll need to activate auto-pay; otherwise it’s $55. Video resolution is capped at 480p. Doesn’t include mobile hotspot service.
Best for: Those who want the lowest-priced “Big Four” unlimited plan. Price: $50 per month and up
The fine print: Video is capped at 480p unless you pay an extra $20 per month for HD streaming. Music streamed from Spotify, Pandora, and iHeart Radio doesn’t count toward your monthly data—although that’s really more of a perk for data-limited plans.
Best for: Those who are fine with Sprint’s coverage, but also want mobile hotspot for the same price. Price: $50 per month (plus fees and taxes)
The fine print: Your data speeds start throttling back after just 500MB. Doesn’t include mobile hotspot capability.
Best for: Hard to say. Boost and Sprint are better options due to the low cap for throttling. Price: No unlimited data plan; $20 for unlimited talk and text, plus $10 per GB of monthly data (plus fees and taxes). Only available on Nexus and Pixel phones.",0.0
"Accused Etan Patz killer likely sexually assaulted him: lawyers. The accused killer of Etan Patz likely lured the    boy into a bodega basement to sexually abuse him, prosecutors said Tuesday during closing arguments. “Maybe the defendant tried to sexually assault him but realized Etan was fighting back,” said Assistant District Attorney Joan   at the retrial of Pedro Hernandez, 56, in Manhattan Supreme Court. “Does he shut his victim up that moment by cutting off his air supply?” Etan disappeared from a Soho street the first time he walked alone to the school bus stop on May 25, 1979. Police canvassed the neighborhood for days, but the child’s body was never found and they were unable to gather any forensic evidence. In 2012, cops received a tip that led them to Hernandez, who at the time of Patz’s disappearance worked at a bodega next to the bus stop. Hernandez confessed to enticing Patz into the store’s basement with the promise of a soda and then strangling him to the point of near death. Hernandez admits that he put Patz’s still breathing body into a plastic bag then into a produce box before dumping it in an alley less than two blocks away.   played a montage of seven of the defendant’s videotaped confessions to police, prosecutors and psychiatric experts since his 2012 arrest. The same year Etan disappeared, he told a church group he had killed a boy in New York. “It’s hard to explain away 30 years of confessions,” the prosecutor said. It was the second time   had delivered a summation in the case. A prior 2015 trial ended in a hung jury with one holdout scuttling a conviction after 18 days of deliberations. Six of the jurors from the previous panel listened to the closing Tuesday, seated in the same row as Etan’s father, Stan Patz, and in front of several case detectives. On Monday, defense lawyer Harvey Fishbein argued in his summation that the real killer is convicted and currently imprisoned child molester Jose Ramos. He was dating a woman hired to walk Etan and other neighborhood kids home during a school bus strike in 1979. And Ramos, 72, once told a federal prosecutor he was “90 percent sure” he was with Etan the day he disappeared. Fishbein argued that Hernandez is an unreliable and inconsistent man” and the only evidence against him “is his own words. ” Hernandez has low intelligence and a personality disorder which makes it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy, the attorney said. By the time cops finished interrogating him for 6. 5 hours, Hernandez had been falsely convinced of his own guilt, the lawyer said. The disappearance of Etan has haunted New Yorkers and baffled authorities for decades. He was one of the first missing children to appear on a milk carton. A jury is set to begin deliberating Wednesday.",1.0
"Right-wing Israeli leaders push forward assertive new legislation to preserve Jewish settlements.   JERUSALEM  —     leaders in the Israeli government have seized on the election of Donald Trump to push forward assertive new legislation that would legalize Jewish settlements in the West Bank built on privately owned Palestinian land.  Believing that the time to act is now, as the U. S.   begins to shape his foreign policy, top Israeli ministers voted unanimously Sunday in favor of a bill that would allow Israeli settlements and outposts that were built on property owned by Palestinians to avoid   demolitions. On Monday, Israeli politicians dug in for a fight over the legislation, which would retroactively offer legal protection to thousands of homes built both in   settlements and in newer wildcat outposts that were constructed on private Palestinian land. Palestinian landowners would be given money or alternative land parcels in exchange for their seized property. Israel considers most of its settlements legal but has acknowledged that some are either built without approval by the military or were erected on private Palestinian lands.     The move by Israeli leaders is one of the first concrete responses to the Trump election on the international stage. Trump and his advisers have signaled that the incoming administration will be more supportive of Israel than was President Obama, whose State Department has sharply criticized settlements as “an obstacle to peace,” even as the White House awarded Israel an unprecedented $38 billion in military aid over the coming decade and has staunchly defended Israel in political forums.  Naftali Bennett, Israel’s education minister and the leader of the   Jewish Home party, said the Trump victory means that “the era of the Palestinian state is over,” a direct challenge to the official government position of backing a   solution. Bennett and his allies view the full legalization of the settlements built on Palestinian land as only a first step. Bennett wants Israel to formally annex the 60 percent of the West Bank where the   settlements are located, thereby ending any prospect for a viable Palestinian state. Speaking to foreign correspondents Monday, Bennett said the Trump election and shifting politics in Europe “provide Israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything. ” As for the idea that Israel should wait and see where Trump is going, Bennett said it is important for Israel to declare what it wants. The draft legislation was opposed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the move “childish and irresponsible. ” Even so, senior members and top ministers of Netanyahu’s fellow Likud party approved a bill that their leader considers   and needlessly provocative. Netanyahu finds himself in a tight spot. If the draft legislation is eventually passed by the parliament  —   not a sure bet  —   the Israeli leader fears a wave of condemnation by Europe and the United Nations, where   voices can insist that the settlers are “stealing”   land with government approval. Netanyahu is also wary of what Obama may do in his last months in office. The outgoing president, many Israelis fear, could formally outline what the Americans consider a fair resolution to the   conflict, including the parameters for a future Palestinian state. Obama could do this in a speech or by allowing a resolution to pass in the United Nations. Daniel Friedmann, a former Israeli justice minister, said, “Netanyahu really wanted to avoid this. ” He said the Israeli prime minister “could stop it if he really wanted to, but he is not in an easy position, because he does not want the settlers to think that he is the one who threw it out. ” Netanyahu could still stall or derail the legislation, but the clock is ticking. The first of three readings of the bill is scheduled for Wednesday. The State Department condemned the proposed law, saying it further endangers the prospects for peace. “This legislation would be a dramatic advancement of the settlement enterprise, which is already gravely endangering the prospects for a   solution,” State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said on Monday. “This only makes clear the choice Israel faces between building more settlements and preserving the possibility of peace. ” Trudeau added that the State Department hopes the proposal does not become law but declined to say whether the administration plans any response if it is enacted.  The move to press ahead with the “legalization bill” was spurred by the Israeli Supreme Court, which ordered that a Jewish settlement called Amona be evacuated and demolished because a portion of it was built on privately owned Palestinian land. On Monday, the high court rejected a government appeal for a delay and gave the Israeli military until Dec. 25 to clear the settlement. Demolition orders against other settlements built on private Palestinian land are also looming. Today about 400, 000 Jewish settlers are living on 125 settlements and 100 outposts in the   West Bank, on territory that Palestinians want for a future state. Most of the world considers the settlements illegal under international law. The United States calls the communities “illegitimate. ” Israel disputes that. In the past year, the Obama White House and the State Department have condemned settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem with sharply escalating rhetoric, openly questioning whether Netanyahu is truly committed to a   solution. Shai Ben Yosef, a leader of the Ofra settlement, which also is partly built on private Palestinian land, told the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that “Trump’s election removes that excuse of, ‘Oy vey, what are they going to do to us?’ ” He added: “The person about to move into the White House is a man whose motivation to pressure Israel is much smaller. We can reach agreements with him about legalizing the settlements. ” Yosef said Netanyahu has often cited Washington as the reason for his insistence that settlements grow slowly, out of fear of upsetting the Americans. With Trump’s election, he said, “our government needs to drop all those old excuses. ”  As usual, the Palestinians were on the sidelines as their fates were being debated in the Israeli parliament and courts. The Palestinian government condemned the move to legalize settlements built on private Palestinian land as “theft. ” Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, vowed that the Palestinians would go to the U. N. Security Council to seek to block the legislation’s implementation. He called the move “a dangerous escalation in the region. ” The move is not universally embraced in Israel, either. Isaac Herzog, leader of the opposition in parliament, said the proposed bill is a “serious stain on Israel’s law books, because it authorizes theft and robbery. There is no precedent, nothing like it, in which the Israeli government authorized a law that allows taking land from private people. ” Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit warned that legislation contradicts international law and said he wouldn’t be able to defend the bill in front of the high court. “I think that it is too early and premature for politicians to make statements and I think it is not wise,” Israel’s former national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said of the Israelis who think they know what Trump’s intentions are toward Israel and the Palestinians.  Carol Morello in Washington contributed to this report.  Read more:     ",-0.5
"Ohio Gov. John Kasich just saved his state’s clean energy standards.  Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, just vetoed a bill, passed by the Ohio legislature earlier this month, that would have made the state’s renewable energy portfolio (RPS) standards voluntary for two years. This means the standards will now go back into effect in January, after a   suspension that began in 2014.     The bill was driven by legislators involved in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) a conservative group that has been waging (mostly unsuccessful) war on state energy standards across the country. ALEC’s champion in the legislature, Cincinnati Republican Rep. Bill Seitz, originally put forward a bill that would have scrapped the renewable energy requirements altogether, but it went nowhere, so Republicans in the legislature softened it. As the bill was debated, Kasich indicated that he wanted the standards to be reinstated and threatened to veto any bill that scrapped them. The legislature’s bid to make the standards voluntary rather than suspending them was an attempt to finesse Kasich’s opposition, but in the end it proved fruitless. In a statement, Kasich said the bill “amounts to   damage to both our state’s   and   economic competitiveness. ”     Now the standards, which require Ohio utilities to get 12. 5 percent of their energy from renewable energy by 2025, will be effective again as of January. For more background on the history of the Ohio bill, see this post.  [UPDATE: Oh lord, I just saw the reaction from Seitz and it is . .. quite something. I’m recording it here for posterity. From the Cleveland Plain Dealer:     Reaction from Sen. William Seitz, a Cincinnati Republican and the driving force behind legislative efforts since 2013 to modify or altogether scrap the state’s  energy and efficiency mandates was quick and somewhat bitter. ”It is apparent that Gov. Kasich cares more about appeasing his coastal elite friends in the renewable energy business than he does about the millions of Ohioans who decisively rejected this ideology when they voted for   Trump,” he wrote in an email immediately after the release of the veto. While praising Trump and his ”amazing cabinet of free market capitalists,” Seitz vowed to make another effort in the coming year to get rid of the standards.  ”We will do our part by launching a full scale effort next session to totally repeal these [former Gov. Ted]   mandates, With   majorities next session, we are optimistic of success.   ",-1.0
"‘Hamilton’ backlash will hit at Tonys. As we close in on the June 12 Tony Awards  —   the excitement mounts!  —   here’s a snapshot of the race: “Hamilton” has a   16 nominations, but it’s not going to topple Mel Brooks’ “The Producers” for the most wins. Mel will remain the King of Broadway with his 12 Tonys. An informal survey of Tony voters reveals a few cracks in the “Hamilton” facade. Cynthia Erivo, the breakout star of “The Color Purple,” is the clear favorite for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical, snapping the prize away from Phillipa Soo, of “Hamilton. ” Both are terrific, but   Erivo is one reason why “The Color Purple,” a show dismissed by many voters back in 2005, is on track to win Best Revival of a Musical. Soo was also one of the “Hamilton” cast members who agitated for a share of the profits. There are plenty to go around, of course, but more than a few producers  —   and some writers from the Dramatists Guild  —   are worried about setting a precedent. They’re prepared to fight Actors’ Equity on this front if it comes up in future negotiations. “We will argue that ‘Hamilton’ is unique,” one producer says. “Actors are not entitled to profits. They’re entitled to a paycheck, but we take the risk. ” Leslie Odom Jr. my “Smash”   was another “Hamilton” agitator, so there’s grumbling about him as well. He’s terrific as Aaron Burr, for which he’s nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical, and I think he’s on track to be a big movie or TV star. But more than a few voters told me they marked their ballot for Danny Burstein of “Fiddler on the Roof” instead. “He’s earned it,” one producer says. My money’s still on Odom, but if there’s going to be an upset on Tony night, look for it in this category. The Tony for Best Choreography will likely go to Savion Glover for “Shuffle Along. ” Voters like this show, and Glover’s work is one reason why it moves so swiftly. He’s brilliantly   the original musical’s dances while giving them a modern spin. There’s support for “Shuffle” director George C. Wolfe in his category, but probably not enough to upset Thomas Kail, who staged “Hamilton. ” Let me put in a word for John Doyle. I never gave much thought to “The Color Purple,” but his production has made me a huge fan of the show. In fact, I’m waving my hand in the air and singing “Like a blade of   a   a waterfall” as I write this. David Rockwell is quietly gaining traction for Best Scenic Design of a Musical for his exquisite jewel box set for “She Loves Me. ” Voters adore this revival, lovingly directed by Scott Ellis. It won’t topple “The Color Purple,” but voters will give it a nod by recognizing Rockwell. I’m picking up a lot of support in her category for Ann Roth, who designed the witty costumes for “Shuffle Along. ” Everybody loves this salty old broad. (She won’t be offended by that phrase, trust me!) How can you not vote for a woman who breaks out the charcuterie and the vino when you visit her at her costume shop? Plus, she should have won for her brilliantly funny costumes for “The Book of Mormon” in 2011. (“Priscilla, Queen of the Desert” won, if you can believe that.) Now that I’ve thoroughly depressed the “Hamilton” producers with what they won’t win, let me lift their spirits with what they will win. Best Musical is a given, and so is Best Original Score (Music   Lyrics) Written for the Theatre. It pains me to admit this, but I’m coming around to   Miranda’s score, which I’ve given a few spins on my CD player. I’m not a rapper, and my head hurts from all that rhyming (“Aaron Burr, Sir”?) but “Burn” and “It’s Quiet Uptown” are lovely. And “Wait for It” is a Broadway standard in the making. “Hamilton” is also going to win Best Book of a Musical, but I must report that voters find the   “Hamilton: The Revolution” a bit much. That’s the book Manuel   with his Boswell, Jeremy McCarter, about the making of the musical. “I’ve never read such pretentious drivel in my life,” scoffs one voter. “The  !” Still, he’s casting his vote for the “Hamilton” script. Like many, he’s trying to separate the show from the hype, which everyone agrees is out of control. As another voter says: “I love ‘Hamilton.’ But if I have to read one more story about it in the New York Times, I’m canceling my subscription. ” As they say in “The Color Purple”: “Amen!”",1.0
"Clinton’s VP Announcement Is the Ultimate Text From Hillary. Hillary Clinton finally announced her vice-presidential running mate today. Senator Tim Kaine isn't an exciting pick, but he makes sense. Clinton more or less has liberals safely on her side; Kaine is a moderate white man from Virginia, a swing state, which pretty much checks off all the demographic and electoral boxes where she needs to build up more support. What's more interesting is how Clinton told the public she would deliver the news: via a text from Hillary. It was the ultimate Internet age callback to the viral meme of Clinton and her now infamous sunglasses and Blackberry. But it was also a way to drum up anticipation among her supporters for an event that is, admittedly, a snoozefest for anyone but cable news producers. ",0.0

"AMC’s ‘Night Manager’ is a grand slam spy caper. There are two kinds of spy movies: Loud, splashy,   spectacles like the   “Mission: Impossible” franchises and geopolitical thrillers in which people in dark suits quietly stab each other in the back  —   and a big action scene is somebody photographing secret documents. Many of those   intelligence capers are based on John Le Carré novels, as is AMC’s breathtaking new miniseries, “The Night Manager. ” It’s going to slay the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The   British import, which premieres Tuesday night, is driven by Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, who spend the entire show playing a deadly game of cat and “ . ” Hiddleston’s been equally at ease playing the villainous Loki in the “Thor” flicks and Hank Williams in “I Saw the Light. ” Here, he graduates to sexy, charismatic leading man as Jonathan Pine, a former military man now working as night manager in a luxury Cairo hotel. Thanks to sheer bad timing, Pine is dragged into the shady world of Laurie’s Richard Roper, aka “The worst man in the world. ” To the casual observer, Roper is a wealthy philanthropist with a hot girlfriend, Jed (Elizabeth Debicki). But behind closed doors, he peddles weapons of mass destruction to whoever can pay his inflated prices. Catching Roper is a life mission for Angela Burr (the wonderful Olivia Colman, David Tennant’s   on “Broadchurch”) the slightly frumpy, unprepossessing head of the tiny “International Enforcement Agency. ” When Pine agrees to help her  —   by infiltrating Roper’s inner circle  —   she’s closer than ever to her goal. One of the things that makes Le Carré novels, such as 1993’s “The Night Manager,” so compelling is how trying to do good is a futile endeavor. The contrast between Burr’s small operation and Roper’s seemingly unstoppable power is depressing. Worse, corruption is everywhere and rival intelligence agencies undermine each other  —   a spy’s worst enemy is often the colleague across the hall. The miniseries captures this Le Carré essence, but also the story’s breathless suspense. The pace is slow, nobody raises their voice  —   and yet you’re glued to the screen. It helps that the show has a unity of tone and visuals that’s rare on TV: All the episodes were handled by one writer, David Farr, and one director  —   Denmark’s   Susanne Bier, an Oscar winner for “ . ” Farr made judicious changes to the novel, chief among them his turning the book’s male Burr into a woman, and a pregnant one at that. More controversial is the new ending. But then, it was approved by Le Carré himself, and if it’s good enough for him, who are we to complain?",1.0
"How the RNC Would Handle a Worst-Case Scenario Like a Bio or Chemical Attack. The Republican National Convention this week takes place under a certain sense of unease, and not just of the norovirus variety. Recent attacks in Nice and Dallas are just the most recent in a string of violent events that make the world feel off-kilter, and large gatherings of people like a potential target. The city of Cleveland is prepared, of course, though even its police officers are uneasy about the city’s generous open carry laws this week, which allow for powerful weapons to be carried outside the convention’s home at the Quicken Loans Arena. There’s another kind of threat, though, that Cleveland has also readied itself for: That of a biological, chemical, or radiological event. Police officers in Cleveland, Ohio demonstrate some of their security assets, including remote-controlled robots, horse-mounted officers, bomb-sniffing dogs on July 14 2016 ahead of the Republican National Convention.

"The Day Without a Woman organizers have been released from jail.  Four leading organizers of “A Day Without a Woman,” a   strike for women’s rights, were arrested Wednesday during an act of civil disobedience in New York City.    Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory, Carmen Perez, and Bob Bland (who were also the lead organizers of the Women’s March on Washington) were arrested after blocking traffic outside Trump International Hotel in Columbus Circle.  The organizers were released Wednesday night. Bland, who recently gave birth, was the last to be released. After Sarsour was released, she told the Huffington Post she was upset Bland was still being held, because Bland was “expressing her milk in the sink” and needed to nurse her baby.  Nonetheless, Sarsour said, “I feel empowered, I feel proud of what I did today. . .. I hope it sends a message to people that you’ve got to risk it, you’ve got to be bold in this moment. ”     A total of 13 organizers and supporters of A Day Without a Woman were arrested Wednesday, according to a spokesperson.

But we are together, reSisters. #DayWithoutAWoman pic. twitter.  —   Women’s March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017    The arrests happened after a large rally supporting A Day Without a Woman in downtown Manhattan.       The scene at 59th and 5th right now. #daywithoutawoman #womensstrike pic. twitter.  —   Charlotte Alter (@CharlotteAlter) March 8, 2017    Demonstrators have been protesting both in public and in private, by taking the day off work, wearing red, refusing to shop, or attending rallies.  The purpose of the “strike” is to make the world appreciate women’s work  —   which is systematically undervalued  —   by taking away that work for a day. It’s also a demand for women’s equality and policies like paid family leave, a $15 minimum wage, and full abortion rights.  These organizers are trying to use the Women’s March as a starting point for a bigger movement  A Day Without a Woman was the fourth of 10 major protest actions that the recently arrested Women’s March organizers are leading during President Trump’s first 100 days in office.     “We want to reintroduce the notion of strike in the political lexicon of this country,” Lamis Deek, a   attorney and one of the organizers of the Day Without Women, told Bloomberg.  Organizers hope to keep up the huge grassroots momentum that drew more than 4 million people worldwide to protest for women’s rights the day after Trump’s inauguration, and they hope to turn that momentum into   political power. They have a huge list of supporters who said they wanted to stay involved in activism after the march was over. In just over a month, the Women’s March has also managed to turn itself into an organization with a big email list and big potential staying power.  Sure, organizers have put a lot of effort and promotion into A Day Without a Woman  —   but the Women’s March should still have plenty of other tricks up its sleeve once March 8 has come and gone. Technology has helped the Women’s March build a ton of capacity in a short time. And it’s not just Facebook and other social media; those tools are great at spreading the word about events, but not so great for   community organizing. The Women’s March website and email list is managed through Action Network  —   a platform only available to progressive activists, and one that is specifically designed to help organizers channel scattered grassroots energy into something more focused.    “The Women’s March is a great   example of what we were trying to build from the beginning,” Brian Young, executive director of Action Network, told Vox. The march got started with completely disconnected grassroots Facebook events, he said  —   but the organizing really took off once the march had a central organizing hub where activists could register their own local events or find ones nearby. The second of the “10 Actions for the First 100 Days” events was about helping activists organize local strategy meetings, or “huddles. ” Young thinks these huddles were just as impressive and important as the original march, even though they involved fewer people overall and got almost no media attention. “They had about 5, 000 huddles. There are organizations that have been around for decades that can’t get people to come to 5, 000 events,” Young said. “They had this base of support and knew hundreds of people who were willing to step up and organize their communities. ” A women’s general strike is still a huge, ambitious lift, one that could easily collapse under the weight of its own expectations. But at least in the modern era, it probably has better chances of succeeding now than ever before.  ",-1.0

"How to Die—and Grieve—in 2020. Welcome to the first edition of Plaintext. I’m Steven Levy, WIRED’s editor at large, and Plaintext is my personal look at what’s happening in the world of digital technology—who makes it and how it affects us. At first, this weekly column will be free for everyone to access. Eventually, only WIRED subscribers will get Plaintext as a newsletter. You’ll get to keep reading it in your inbox by subscribing to WIRED (discounted 50%), and in the process getting all of our amazing tech coverage in print and online. This initial version has death as its subject. I promise they won’t all be this morbid! In the past few days, we’ve seen the passing of three giants: Clay Christensen, Leila Janah, and Kobe Bryant. In each case, an unmoderated memorial service broke out on the internet. Long gone are the days when New York Times obituaries, the Oscars of the genre, framed the way many of us mourned the loss of public figures. Those are now sideshows to instant tsunamis of discussion. We don’t accept handed-down summaries of those we lost—we participate. We write them ourselves. But all too often, these fast-twitch reactions end up churning up a melee. Today’s polarized web reflects and aggravates the ill will present in the world at large, almost guaranteeing that a major event like the sudden loss of a basketball god will trigger complications and even enmity. As soon as TMZ broke the news of Kobe’s death, the entire internet madly ululated. Those who hadn’t given a thought to Kobe in a year were posting that their pain was such they couldn’t get out of bed. But others were swift to bring up the 2003 incident when he was accused of raping a 19-year-old hotel worker; he ended up settling the court case. To them, the unmitigated celebration of the lost star ignored not just that incident but the experience of all who suffered sexual assaults or harassment. Death Twitter’s canonization of Kobe collided head-on with the #MeToo movement’s cultural legacy. There’s a world where those complexities might be balanced, but Twitter and Facebook are not those worlds. In a full obituary, a book-length account, or even a Wikipedia entry, a  biographical blemish can be contextualized. But context and nuance are nowhere in tweets and Facebook comments. Thus grief was joined by grievance, the coin of the social media realm. The firestorm over Kobe’s legacy spawned a disturbing subplot when a Washington Post reporter simply tweeted a link to a story about the alleged rape, triggering a fusillade of angry responses, some of which she then exposed. The threats were so harsh—one of them even tweeted her home address—that she had to leave home that night and stay in a hotel.  The Post suspended her; then, after a staff revolt, it revoked the suspension. What relevance did this online battle have to the real losses of Bryant, his daughter, and the seven others in the downed helicopter? Not much. The clashes we have on social media are rarely illuminating or cleansing. They certainly don’t benefit grieving families. After hashtags fade, the pain remains. Unlike much else on social media, death is a fact that ultimately can’t be faked. A digital wake doesn’t have to be so fraught. The online tributes to Christensen were less focused on his considerable professional achievements, including his influential book The Innovator’s Dilemma, than his belief that the ultimate metric is the people whose lives you touch. Granted, he was less famous than Bryant, but the heartfelt condolences—including by people (like me) who had met him in passing or been in one of his classes, or were simply moved by his writing—were more in line with how actual wakes or funerals tend to go: a warm, loving celebration of a person, one final time. The posts about Leila Janah went even further, injecting her remarkable life story into the mainstream more emphatically than when she lived. Before last week I had only the foggiest sense of who she was, mainly through a WIRED interview five years ago. But those who knew or admired her flooded the internet with personal stories about a courageous and charismatic 37-year-old who created several startups to help reduce global poverty.  When she succumbed to cancer, she was CEO of Samasource, a company she founded in Kenya that arranged for local workers, mainly women, to do jobs for companies like Microsoft, Google, and Walmart. The estimated 50,000 people it helped would have been only a start for Janah. While her impact was felt immediately online, it took a week for The New York Times to post an obituary of this extraordinary figure. Chalk one up to social media. In 1997, I marked the beginnings of “virtual grief” with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The unprecedented response signified the mainstreaming of the internet, as people realized they had a way to express themselves—even if they went over the top a bit—on the passing of a famous and beloved figure. Here's what I wrote on September 14, 1997, in a piece for Newsweek: When I asked a woman from Austin, Texas, why she posted, she replied, by e-mail, ""I felt the need to reach out to Diana's sons hoping that maybe in some small way they would find some comfort in my words.'' That William and Harry will probably never see her message is almost irrelevant. The Diana grief was a sign of how our reactions to mega-celebrities would evolve. The early days were a more free and forgiving time. Now, as with anything else on social media, a misstep in your post brings instant retribution. Since you’re doing this by email, I thought it appropriate to ask if you think the newly resurgent email newsletter phenomenon could be a replacement for decimated local journalism, in print, on the Web, or over the airwaves? —Walt, a retired product reviewer in Washington, DC. Well, Walt, as you intuited, I do believe email delivery is a thing. The case for boosting local news seems especially strong. I subscribe to newsletters from the Philadelphia Inquirer, which covers my hometown sports teams. They don’t charge, but if they did I might pay. That model—charging for specialized local topics that some people can’t get enough of—could be a nice revenue stream. I also see a business in newsletters on specific subjects ripe for monetization, such as a politics newsletter with stuff that's too obscure for general readers but a must-read for insiders. To me the main value is in funneling readers—and getting them to pay for—a more complete package, whether it’s in print or digital.  So my answer is enhancement, not replacement. But thanks for the question. I bet if Walt were still doing product reviews, some people would pay for that newsletter. You can submit questions to mail@wired.com. Write ASK LEVY in the subject line. Here’s the latest indication we’re moving one step closer to the end of civilization: the return of the Hummer, a vehicle as healthy as a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. GM’s decision to make this lane-hogging beast electric is a huge irony, of course. Can a vehicle be clean if it needs a whole power plant to recharge it? Ever since Mark Zuckerberg shared the idea with me in early 2018, I’ve been following Facebook’s efforts to start a “Supreme Court” that can overrule its content decisions (though not its policies). Here’s my report as the effort approaches reality. Spinning satellites into space sounds like science fiction or something that Larry Page might think up. But Daniel Oberhaus has the goods on a company actually trying to do this. College Humor was once one of the web’s big successes. Now it’s not so funny.

"Go inside the surreal world of Vienna’s vanishing dive bars.         (Klaus Pichler)  “That’s the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen. ”  —   Charles Bukowski “We’ve lived in bars   And danced on the tables   Hotels, trains and ships that sail   We swim with sharks   And fly with aeroplanes in the air”  —   Cat Power, “Lived in Bars” “The customer is   long as they behave like a king. ”  —   Susanne Breiner, Cafe Adria, Vienna Clemens Marschall and Klaus Pichler’s new book, “Golden Days Before They End” (Editions Patrick Frey, 2016) follows in a   photo documentary tradition of shining light on life’s underbelly. Like Brassai, Anders Petersen and many others before him, Pichler has taken his camera out of humanity’s mainstream and into one of its darker corners, populated with distress, ennui, despair and even a little bit of tenderness here and there. Brassai took to the streets of Paris, documenting its nightlife in the 1920s and ’30s. For Petersen it was the Café Lehmitz bar in Hamburg in the 1960s and ’70s. Both Brassai’s and Petersen’s bodies of work are now considered seminal. One of Petersen’s images even adorns Tom Waits’s “Rain Dogs” album. “Golden Days Before They End” recalls both of these works but in updated form. Pichler and Marschall, the write, set out to explore the small, sometimes out of the way bars called Branntweiners, places often associated with the violence of bar fights and stabbings. Most people, “regular” people, tend to avoid these drinking establishments, but Pichler and Marschall sought them out. The result is a presentation of the denizens of Vienna’s vanishing dive bars, illuminated in a colorful,   light. We see bar regulars who’ve had one too many and are flat out on the floor or the lone drinker snuggling up to a dog they brought along  —   people who have found some sense of community in these disheveled places. Throughout Pichler’s photos and Marschall’s interviews with bar patrons, we are given a document of life on the edges in these small places that are disappearing because of high rents and the increasing costs of doing business. Places filled with a messy, sometimes ugly life that also has its tender, beautiful and    moments, too.

"This is a legendary photographer’s twenty-year obsession with ‘real food’.         (Benidorm, Spain, 2003 © Martin   Photos)  Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few years I’m sure you’re oh so familiar with a tendency of your social media feeds to be choked to death with images of food (and maybe cats too, but certainly food). There are websites devoted to the fetishization of food, or “food porn. ” There’s even a Reddit thread for it. But the pictures here are not food porn at all. Really, they aren’t. They are the result of   photographer Martin Parr’s documentation over two decades of what he says is just “real food. ” And they are now available in a recently published book called, yes, “Real Food. ” (Phaidon, 2016) To be sure, you probably wouldn’t be inundated by these kinds of pictures of food on your social media feeds. These aren’t your friend’s humblebrag pictures of the delectables they’ve been munching on, and they’re certainly not the luxurious food spreads that you see in food magazines. These are unflinching, sardonic, edgy appraisals and affirmations of normal food  —   direct, sometimes harsh and almost always funny, depictions of melting ice cream, cans of spam and slices of plain old white bread. These fit perfectly into Parr’s oeuvre; he has spent a career capturing humorous (sometimes darkly) representations of humdrum daily life. His photographic books have focused on bored couples, bad weather, people using cell phones, and the culture of tourists being, well, tourists. Parr is represented by the legendary photo agency Magnum Photos and lives in London. Prints of his work can fetch upwards of tens of thousands of dollars. Check out more of his work here.

"A first look at the FDA’s new nutrition label — and 10 reasons it’s different from the old one.      First lady Michelle Obama on Friday unveiled the   overhaul of the nutrition labels you see on every packaged product at the grocery store, and it looks a lot like the old one  —   at least superficially. The new label still retains the minimalist      look that designers have praised over the years, and it highlights many of the same categories, such as cholesterol and sodium. But this is where it might get confusing: Even though it doesn’t look all that different, some categories are now emphasized more than others, and the way some numbers are calculated has changed. These are critical updates that highlight the breakthroughs in nutrition science and upheavals in our country’s disease burden over the years. Many of the changes represent losses for the food industry, which fought hard against updates because they essentially put some of the blame for our poor health on added sugars, eating overly large quantities of servings and consuming too many calories. So it’s important that you read on to learn more about how it all works. “The intention is not to tell consumers what to eat, but rather to make sure they have the tools and accurate information they need to choose foods that are right for themselves and their families,” Susan Mayne, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a conference call with reporters. The first lady joked while announcing the changes at a health summit early Friday that “very soon you will no longer need a microscope, a calculator or a degree in nutrition to figure out whether the food you’re buying is actually good for our kids. ” Experts predict that the new labeling guidelines may lead to major reformulations of some of the 800, 000 products that currently carry the labels. More than 77 percent of Americans have said in surveys that they use the nutrition facts label when shopping, and companies worry that some of their products may appear less appealing under the new rules. Those changes could end up costing the industry many millions. While reducing things like added sugars may sound simple, it actually requires a   and complex science. Your morning cereal, for example, could turn to dust in your bowl if the mix of ingredients isn’t just right. Or if you want to increase the amount of whole grains in a product, you may have to add more sugar to offset the bitterness of the new taste. “Reformulating a product is not easy. There are all sorts properties that food scientists have to pay attention to, and one of those physical properties when it comes to sugar and salt is that they tend to hold things together,” said William Dietz, who researches obesity, nutrition and physical fitness at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. Then there’s the issue that some Americans equate something that’s healthier with something that’s less tasty. Kraft recently revealed that it had reduced the sodium in its macaroni and cheese without telling consumers until the product had already been out for months, for fear of alienating fans of its original product. The Nutrition Facts label was introduced more than 20 years ago by the government with the goal of helping consumers eat more healthfully. The FDA has been working to update the tag, which is put on almost all packaged foods, for more than two years. Americans will start seeing the new label soon because most manufacturers will be required to have theirs in place by July 26, 2018. (Those with annual food sales of less than $10 million will have another year to comply.) Government standards for labeling of what Americans eat have extremely high stakes and can potentially boost sales of certain types of foods while tanking sales of others. When the FDA first announced several years ago that it wanted to revise the system, there was a huge debate over its content and design. Everyone, including consumers, scientists and food lobbyists, got involved.   [Previously: Food labels to get first makeover in 20 years with new emphasis on calories, sugar]   Here’s a look at some key changes:  Serving sizes. This is perhaps the most important and controversial update and one that has not been changed in 20 years. The serving sizes now reflect what people currently eat  —   rather than whatever the companies decide seems reasonable. So serving sizes that were equivalent to only a few chips might now reflect the whole package. This change is consistent with the new Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, but there has been a lot of concern that people will take the serving sizes  —   which as a whole will be much larger than in the past  —   as recommendations rather than descriptions. In a study published in the journal Appetite, researchers argued that this change will not make Americans eat healthier but make them eat more and get fatter. FDA officials have said they disagree with that point of view and emphasized that serving sizes for some foods  —   like yogurt  —   will actually go down. Calories. The total count is now highlighted in huge letters rather than being in the same type size as the other nutrition information. This change, FDA officials have said, reflects the country’s growing obesity epidemic. Added sugars. This completely new category is important given recent updates to the dietary guidelines urging Americans to cut down on sugars that come from processed foods such as cakes and cookies. Added sugars are measured in both grams and as a percent daily value. The sugar industry has said that this emphasis on added sugars is not scientifically justifiable, but the FDA disagrees. “For the past decade experts have advised consumers to reduce their intake of added sugars because they contribute empty calories to the diet without providing any additional nutritional benefits,” the FDA’s Mayne said. This change will allow consumers to tell the difference between sugars added during processing versus sugars that come naturally, such as in fresh fruits and dairy, she added.   products. For some food products that could be consumed in multiple sittings  —   or in one single swoop if you really have the munchies  —   there will now be two columns to indicate the   and   calorie and nutrition information that will save you from doing some math. This will include items like that pint of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.   packages. Packages or containers that are between one and two servings  —   such as   bottles of sodas  —   will now be labeled as one serving. Sodium and dietary fiber. The percent daily values for sodium, dietary fiber and vitamin D will change for many foods based on the new   Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Institute of Medicine recommendations. Be aware that this doesn’t mean the manufacturer has changed the recipe of your favorite food, just that the new recommendations either increase or decrease the amount you need to eat. More specifically, previous recommendations allowed Americans to eat up to 25 grams of fiber day. The new recommendations call for up to 28 grams a day. So if a food contains 5 grams of fiber, the old label would have listed 20 for the percent daily value. The new label would have 18 percent for the percent daily value. For sodium, the percent daily value used to be based on a maximum of 2, 400 mg of sodium a day and will now be based on 2, 300 mg a day. Vitamin D and potassium. In the past, labels only had the percent daily values for vitamin D and potassium, but they’ll now also show the gram amount. “These are nutrients that some people are not getting enough of, which puts them at higher risk for chronic disease,” the FDA said in a statement. Vitamins A and C. These will no longer be required on labels, since deficiencies of these vitamins are rare nowadays. Fat. Based on research that shows the type of fat is more important than the amount, the “Calories from Fat” line will disappear. However, “Total Fat,” and the subcategories “Saturated Fat,” and “Trans Fat” will still be required. Percent Daily Value. The explanation of what this is continues to appear at the bottom of the label and is still based on a 2, 000 calorie diet, but it is more streamlined.  This post has been updated.    The United States government once considered butter and margarine as one of seven food groups to consume daily. Look back at other advice that, sadly, is no longer a part of the USDA’s dietary guidelines. (Jayne W.   Washington Post)   Read more: Americans’ junk food habits start in toddler years.

"Trump’s Muslim ban would also hurt students.  DONALD TRUMP’S proposal to ban Muslims from the country has taken many forms over the past few months. All have been abhorrent. All, including the most recent iteration, would have a consequence that has so far gone ignored: the harm it would do to colleges and universities across the United States. In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, Mr. Trump revised his original call for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” and instead suggested suspending immigration “from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism. ” If, in order to qualify as “compromised by terrorism,” a country must have experienced a recent attack, Mr. Trump’s list of undesirables includes citizens of France, Belgium and, well, the United States. Even if Mr. Trump intends to refer to countries the State Department recognizes as nations where terrorist cells operate, allies such as Saudi Arabia are in the mix. In a speech this week, Mr. Trump further refined his proposal as suspending immigration from “some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism” while also subjecting   visitors to “an ideological screening test. ”  Saudi Arabia sent almost 60, 000 students to study at U. S. colleges in 2015. India, also on the State Department’s radar, sent almost 133, 000. Iran and Turkey sent more than 10, 000 each, and Malaysia about 7, 000. Because most of these students get the money for their educations from sources outside of the United States, they give a significant funding boost to the schools they choose  —   and to the U. S. economy. Saudi Arabian students alone contribute $1. 7 billion every year, though the number may decrease with the shrinking of the scholarship fund that pays the way for many of them. Indian students contribute $3. 6 billion.  Stopping these students from coming to the United States would not only cause economic pain: It would also fly in the face of the cultural exchange that education is supposed to facilitate. Just as U. S. citizens benefit from studying with people of different backgrounds who may have different ideas about the way the world works, students from abroad can take the values they learn here back to their home countries. That is especially important in places such as Saudi Arabia that could benefit most from the democratic ideals U. S. schools try to instill in their students. Mr. Trump’s “extreme vetting” likely would discourage students from every country from coming to the United States, whether to study or to work, by sending a message that the United States is suspicious of the rest of the world and the people in it. Of course, that has always been a central part of Mr. Trump’s isolationist platform. This is just another reason it is dangerous.     Speaking in Youngstown, Ohio, Aug. 15, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to champion immigration reform that would ”screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles.” (The Washington Post)     Read more about this topic:   The Post’s View: Trump’s   plan copies Obama’s  —   except for his disturbing Muslim ban   Eugene Robinson: Trump’s special version of Jim Crow  —   for Muslims   Ghazala Khan: Trump criticized my silence.

"This next president better be president for everyone.    Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality.    ST. PAUL, Minn.  The country is in the grip of fear and anger, riven by class conflict, so we hear, though this is not so apparent on a spring day as you awaken to the sweet smell of earth and the old farmer DNA in you thinks, This is going to be a good year. Things are looking up at last. Unreasonable optimism is what America was built on, people, and April is around the corner, the song of the meadowlark is heard in the northern latitudes. Baseball will soon head north. My grandson is eagerly learning Chinese. Tell me about injustice and I hear you, meanwhile the world is alive with possibility. That’s not a liberal or a conservative position, it’s your old father talking. I was at a friend’s party on Sunday among a good many Bernie buttons  —   Enough Is Enough, On the Journey with Bernie, Feel the Bern, Sanders  —   Not For Sale, Bernie for Single Payer Health Care  —   I held my tongue.  ? We passed that town hours ago. But they were Berning hot for their man. At last, they’d found a cult they really could believe in. That’s nice for them.  Last year, I stopped in Lubbock, Tex.  to visit the grave of Buddy Holly and see a prairie dog village and a collection of a hundred old windmills and had a plate of biscuits and gravy at the Red Zone Cafe. A man who looked like he worked outdoors for a living came over and we had a talk that went like this:   You’re not from here, are you. No, sir, I’m from Minnesota. I am guessing that you are a liberal Democrat. That was a good guess, sir. Well, I’m not but my son is marrying one, and I was going to get your advice on that because he told me last night that she is expecting a baby. My advice, sir, is to be kind even if it kills you and if the subject of politics comes up, count to 10. That’s sort of what I was thinking, too.  When I stopped in Lubbock, I knew where I was. The city went 69 percent for Mitt Romney, 28 percent for Barack Obama. But I don’t feel like an alien there. I admire old windmills, I’m curious about prairie dogs, and I’m a fan of Buddy Holly. To me, he does not fade away. And I feel enriched by biscuits and gravy. I do not let nutritionists run my life.  My Bernie friends and I are not   workers, we’re writers and artists and musicians. We did scut work in our youth and didn’t care to make a career of it, repetitious labor under close supervision with Mickey Mouse rules, so we went off in the direction of our dreams, as Thoreau suggested, and became songwriters, potters, documentary filmmakers, an adventure that America does smile upon. But life in the arts is perilous.   I used to do   dance   With a blowtorch, blue paint, and no pants,   Which some people guessed   Was genius and the rest   Left quickly when given the chance.   Some artists work for years to bring forth something that is D. O. A. Some fall into the greasy hands of drugs and alcohol. The market for photography is slim and for poetry even slimmer. It is a perilous life, replete with quicksand, banana peels, mean dogs, vultures on fence posts, and now and then you get strapped to a conveyor inching headfirst toward a mill saw, but it’s all part of the deal. We signed up for it. Today, Thoreau is a great author but Concord knew him as a handyman and a nanny.  I am wary of people who fix on one source of our troubles  —   Wall Street, the Chinese, a lack of kelp in the diet  —   and they can’t tell you enough about it. My Bernie friends are true believers. Cool. If I were in a bar in Burlington and a grumpy old man in a rumpled suit stood up and harangued us about the banks and free college tuition and   and the corruption of the political system, I would cheer and buy him a beer. But I don’t want a crusading revival preacher for a president. The guy in Lubbock has to live here, too. Maybe he favors Sen. Ted Cruz ( . ). The choices, at this point, are extremely limited. Some Bernie women wish Elizabeth Warren were running. She’s not. There is a disaster who is in the race, though, and he’s done well against divided opposition.

"5 people have been killed in a mass shooting near Pittsburgh.  Five people were killed and three injured in a shooting at a backyard barbecue and house party in Wilkinsburg, a Pittsburgh suburb, late Wednesday night, according to local police.    Local police said there were at least two shooters, and police are still searching for them, the Pittsburgh   reported. Neighbors reported dozens of gunshots  —   one man said 26; another woman said the shooting continued for at least a minute. Police haven’t said what the motive for the shooting was, nor have they identified suspects. Wilkinsburg is a relatively   area. It had the   murder rate in Allegheny County in 2012. This isn’t the first mass shooting in Wilkinsburg, a town with only about 16, 000 people. In 2000, a man named Ronald Taylor went on a shooting spree at the Burger King and McDonald’s in town, killing two people and injuring three. The murders drew national attention, and Taylor is now on Pennsylvania’s death row.    By some definitions, this is the 44th mass shooting this year Since Wednesday’s mass shooting in Wilkinsburg was at a house party rather than in a public place, it seems likely that people will debate whether it really counts as a ”mass shooting,” even though eight people were shot and two survivors remain in critical condition.    Counting any shooting where at least four people were shot in roughly the same place at the same time, the definition used by the Mass Shooting Tracker, the Wilkinsburg shooting is the 44th mass shooting in 2016. But there’s a debate about whether a ”mass shooting” occurs anytime a large number of people are shot, or whether it only applies to a more specific subset of crimes that particularly terrify the public: shootings perpetrated by a lone gunman in a public place, often seemingly at random.    The distinction matters, because while shootings that kill at least four people aren’t rising, mass shootings in a public place  —   like the massacres in Charleston, San Bernardino, and Aurora, Colorado  —   appear to be increasing. And the debate over what counts as a mass shooting is also a proxy war for the debate about gun control, as Vox’s Dylan Matthews wrote: Supporters of gun control want to define the problem as broadly as possible, while opponents argue that certain types of shootings don’t count. But one thing isn’t up for debate: America has a much higher gun homicide rate than other countries (that doesn’t even take into account that   of gun deaths in the United States are suicides)  —   and a higher homicide rate in general, driven mostly by those gun deaths. Experts say this is due to America’s gun culture: We have more guns, more accessible guns, and more gun deaths  —   both suicides and murders, including domestic violence and violence against police.

"Morgan starts as a nicely creepy sci-fi tale. Then everything goes horribly wrong..  It’s rare to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when a movie goes wrong, but it’s possible to do so with Morgan, the new   horror film from director Luke Scott (the son of Ridley).        Rating  2. 5     For roughly its first   Morgan is a deeply intriguing movie with one question at its center: Did Morgan, an artificial life form played by Anya   (whom you may remember as the protagonist of The Witch) harm one of the scientists caring for her because she’s been constructed incorrectly and is, thus, inherently violent? Or did she harm the scientist because she suffered a glitch? Yes, this premise is pretty similar to that of the terrific 2015 robot drama Ex Machina  —   also about an attempt to determine just how ”human” an artificial human really was  —   but Morgan offers a family dynamic among Morgan and the many scientists caring for her that Ex Machina didn’t have. In essence, the film asks, is it okay for the corporation that technically owns Morgan to kill someone these people think of as family, even if she’s dangerous to them? That’s a fun little   puzzle, as these things go. You can imagine the potential Twilight Zone episode that might have resulted  —   right down to the twist that also ends the film (which I’m going to spoil below, so be forewarned). But pulling off such a story requires a certain degree of thoughtfulness, and whatever thoughtfulness Morgan starts out with disappears as the film enters its final  .    And now let the spoilers begin.  Morgan’s best scene also marks its point of no return             Around Morgan’s halfway point, a major new character enters the story. As the psychologist tasked with evaluating Morgan’s mental workings, Paul Giamatti is at his rumpled best, irritated with the thought that he’s been brought all the way out to a farm in the middle of nowhere to talk to a robot.    But his opinion of Morgan will be key. If he says she’s fine, she’ll be allowed to live. If he deems her a threat, the scientists will be forced to put her to sleep. (A corporate hired gun, played by Kate Mara, is on site to make sure they do what they’re told.) Giamatti only appears in this one sequence, but it’s an impressive one. He begins talking to Morgan like he wants to be her friend, then slowly turns up the heat, until he’s all but daring her to hurt him, just as she hurt the other scientist. And in the end, she does, ultimately leading to the decision to terminate her. It doesn’t go all that well  —   Morgan becomes a horror movie villain and starts killing everyone, while Mara tries to kill Morgan instead.    The problem is that until this point, the film has been toying with ideas about whether Morgan is an actual sentient being, whether she deserves the same sort of rights that a human being might have  —   which would not include having essentially no autonomy   being the property of a corporation. However, it largely tosses those aside in favor of the ”everybody dies” ending. It briefly suggests that Morgan was baited by the psychologist, that she realized she was an entirely separate species and, necessarily, must be at war with her creators. But it invests too little effort in exploring this idea, instead favoring random bursts of violence and splatter. This is too bad, because the movie’s early going is frequently intriguing. And it’s filmed beautifully by Scott, who’s particularly fond of shots featuring the overlapping reflections of various characters as they talk to each other through glass barriers, an effect that allows for both eerie and surprisingly erotic moments.    But the pivot into full horror ultimately undercuts everything else Morgan was going for. Morgan ceases to be an intriguing philosophical quandary when she’s actively working to kill every human she meets. The film’s twist ending (which reveals that Mara is also a robot  —   something you could see coming after reading the film’s premise) tries to raise further issues of artificial intelligence and whether humanity might invent a successor that would cause humanity’s extinction. But it’s all too little, too late. Morgan starts out as an intriguing puzzle for the mind, but it ends up as a generic haunted house tale. At least Ex Machina built to a similarly horrifying conclusion much more organically  —   and in a way that acknowledged the moral complexity of the situation. Morgan mostly offers a   shrug. ",-1.0
"Politics has invaded America’s classrooms since Trump. 7 teachers describe the new reality..  As we approach the 100th day of the Trump administration, America is intensely divided on political topics across the spectrum. And those divisions are playing out in classrooms, a sensitive battleground where issues like class, race, and gender converge.    We collected stories from teachers around the country about how their students, their classroom environments, and their jobs have changed in the era of Trump. Some said they’d noticed an uptick in racist language among students. Others mentioned criticism from parents that they were indoctrinating students in the classroom. Many spoke of navigating uneasy boundaries between fact and ideology when teaching topics such as social studies or climate change.  The following is a snapshot of life in American classrooms after the election. We used only first names so that teachers could speak freely about their experiences. Here are their stories.  Some students are afraid they’ll get deported Mark, Kansas: My high school has a relatively high Latino population, with a fair number of undocumented immigrant students or children or relatives of undocumented immigrants. Many of these students have expressed concerns about the future or have withdrawn because they fear that talking to authority figures might be unwise.    Latino students have always showed a lot of pride in their native country by wearing clothing that represents this heritage, such as flag shirts, actual flags, or sports jerseys. Since the election, this has almost completely stopped.     In the 12 years I have taught at my high school, I have never dealt with any students who have shown white supremacy tendencies. We are a very diverse school. But since the election, a group of around 10   white students have been responsible for   graffiti, random “Trump!” chants at Latino students, using the term “Jewish” as something that is negative, and [sending] mass emails through the online classroom with   and   messages. Government class used to feel irrelevant to a lot of students. No longer. Brad, Missouri: Every day, and in some cases by the hour, the Trump administration enacts or creates policy that lead to teachable moments in my classes. In the past, the study of government  —   three branches, separation of powers, the Constitution, and the bureaucracy  —   would have been pretty mundane and tedious. Now the constant barrage of controversial policy has my students wanting to know, “Can he do that? !”    Their anxiety and concern leads us on a search for a deeper level of understanding of how the structures and institutions of our government are formed and how they function, and will they protect us from tyranny or authoritarianism. Sexism can be harder to tackle than racism Danielle, California: Students have been a lot more openly disrespectful toward women. My students are 14 years old and are fairly  . I get a lot of students commenting on female appearances, making openly   comments. It all feels like normalized behavior to them. I will stop this behavior when it happens and point out how it violates our community agreements, but for a lot of young men I’m just another radical “feminazi,” and it feels that anything I said would simply be rejected and ignored.  It is really hard to not get emotional. For example, we were discussing forced child marriage, and a student refer[red] to a child from the story as a “skanky whore. ” I’ve learned that talking one on one, my previous best strategy for inappropriate comments, doesn’t work because it opens me up for liability, as students can easily lie about our conversation.    Instead, I try to break down in a respectful way for the entire class why certain comments aren’t permitted, but I feel woefully ineffective. As a Latina teacher, I find comments about Latinx people more vitriolic but shockingly easier to shut down than   comments. Parents have a lot of opinions on what does and doesn’t belong in the classroom Dean, California: The election has had a unique effect on colleagues, administration, and parents. Teachers have been warned and reprimanded for discussing political topics or showing TV clips to classes. This comes after a small but vocal number of parent complaints, ranging from the fair, such as no Daily Show clips, to the ridiculous, such as, “Teachers are indoctrinating our children to serve the Islamic State. ”  Administration has been defending most issues valiantly, but I hear things like, “We have to placate these people,” or, “I’m tired of dealing with this parent,” a lot more than I used to. Over the past couple of months, admin has basically directed everyone to be silent on modern topics. This has had a strange and noticeable dampening effect on teachers’ overall enthusiasm. It seems like people are far more careful with their speech than just a year ago. Margaret, Indiana: I feel like I bounce a lot back to the parents. If something controversial comes up, I want to respect the vastly different viewpoints of both halves of the families in my class, so I generally just tell the kids to talk to their parents about it. In some ways it’s passing the buck, but in others it feels the most appropriate response for   . Teaching science is suddenly more political Joshua, Kentucky: As a biology teacher, it is extremely difficult to not seem   when talking about the importance of data or science. Typically students won’t argue with me about what I’m teaching, but there is an undercurrent, through humor or just looks, that makes me worried that what I’m teaching is being viewed as political. Whenever climate change comes up, some students will grumble, “Fake news. ” The most effective method has been to ask the students to evaluate how much weight to give data. We had an amazing set of conversations about belief when it comes to science topics. Can there be a truth when we try in our society to preserve the space for people to say, “Well, I believe . .. ”?    The bathroom bill hit a nerve  —   and forced students to have difficult conversations with each other Luke, Texas: The best conversations I’ve had with students regarding politics and current issues happen outside of class time. After school, when kids hang out in my room for a little while, while they wait for a ride or something, I’ve sustained a great dialogue. I feel like I can be more open and honest with them, and I can listen to them without eating up class time. I let my kids curse and rant and cry if they need to, because that emotion needs to get purged a bit before they can think critically.   One time I had students come in to hang out, and they were in the middle of ranting about a conservative student who was outspoken about the transgender bathroom issue. While they huffed and puffed, in walked that very student. I proceeded to host and structure a civilized conversation between them as the guy was outnumbered by four progressive but angry girls.  It felt like a corny    movie at first, but in the end, they got to share their opinions and why they felt that way, and they ended up understanding each other more. They were thankful by the end of it and didn’t end up hating each other.  Moments like the one above are not in my job description and should not be, but I’ve realized that it’s a reality for any teacher that wants to teach critical thinking and build a trusting rapport with their students. I want to be on the right side of history and work against fascism, but I also want to humbly approach issues with the understanding that I could be wrong. If I teach students how to ask the right questions and think about everything critically, then I feel like I’ve done my best.  First Person is Vox’s home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

"Where White People Meet, the controversial new dating site, explained.  A   mogul from Utah has created either one blatantly racist dating site or one extremely calculated attempt to rile our collective outrage.    Sam Russell is the    mastermind behind Where White People Meet, a dating site whose title explains its purpose. Though anyone can join Russell’s site, its exclusionary title and apparent focus has irked many people on the internet. But Russell doesn’t believe he’s being racist. ”The last thing in the world I am is racist. I dated a black woman once,” Russell told the Washington Post. ”I just believe it’s hypocrisy to say ‘one group can do this, but another can’t. ’” The ”groups” Russell is referring to are the primary audiences for dating websites like Black People Meet or JDate  —   which allow users to connect with black and Jewish singles (respectively). Russell’s views and comments have fueled internet outrage, to the point that what he’s doing feels a bit like performance art; he may even be saying stereotypically racist things to incite anger and draw more attention to his site.    Do white people need Where White People Meet? The reason people are talking about the dating site is that there doesn’t seem to be a need for it. White people still represent the majority of Americans, and in the dating world, there are benefits to being white.    OkCupid, one of the largest dating websites in the US, compiles data on its ”matches” between its members. In 2009, OkCupid found that white men get the most responses from potential mates. It also found that white women tend to reply to white men and exclude nonwhite men.  ”[W]hite women have an   compatibility with almost every group. Yet they only reply well to guys who look like them,” OkCupid   Christian Rudder wrote on the site’s blog. The same data was collected again in 2014, and the numbers stayed consistent:               The boxes represent people’s preferences versus the average; the bottom right box, for example, shows that white women rate white men as 19 percent more attractive than the average guy. These numbers reveal a strong bias against black women and Asian, black, and Latino men. They reveal that people tend to rate their own race more highly. And they reveal that there’s an attractiveness benefit to being a white man. Rudder doesn’t believe it’s outright racism that drives this trend. Instead, he explains, he believes it’s cultural, and because white culture is so dominant, it skews what we find attractive toward whiteness:  Beauty is a cultural idea as much as a physical one, and the standard is of course set by the dominant culture. I believe that’s what you see in the data here. One interesting thing about OkCupid’s interface is that we allow people to select more than one race, so you can actually look at people who’ve combined ”white” with another racial description. Adding ”whiteness” always helps your rating! In fact it goes a long way towards undoing any bias against you.     With this kind of upper hand, the concept of Where White People Meet is sort of puzzling. The thought being: Why do white people need a dating site that’s specifically for them when they’ve already cornered so many other dating sites? The Washington Post’s Caitlin Dewey asked Russell just that. His reply isn’t really steeped in the idea of service, but rather in the idea that because spaces for nonwhite people exist, spaces for white people should also exist. ”It’s our right to have this business,” he told Dewey. ”If we want equal rights in this country, it has to be equal rights for everybody.” Where White People Meet isn’t even a real dating site yet If you poke around the Where White People Meet website, it feels like the shell of something that hasn’t found its footing. In a section advertising its active users, only 11 were present when I checked at midday Tuesday:            And the site’s ”top members” are faceless avatars:            The most active user groups are also in a sorry state. Many of them only have one member:            Where White People Meet doesn’t seem to be a place where white people are meeting.    It’s also worth noting that the site only allows you to perform heterosexual searches:                                       When you try to perform a ”man seeking a man” search or a ”woman seeking a woman” search, the site forces you to seek a heterosexual match. It’s unclear whether this will change in the future, but it seems not all white people are free to meet on Where White People Meet. Despite the site’s apparent lack of users and interactions, Russell told the Washington Post that 100, 000 people visited the site on Sunday and that 1, 033 registered to browse the site for free. He wouldn’t say how many of those registrants ultimately paid the $15 per month typically required to become a   member (there is a special $   trial offer advertised right now). Where White People Meet is perfect bait for internet outrage With a lack of activity on the site but plenty of mainstream news coverage of its existence (the Chicago Tribune, Time, and the Washington Post are among outlets that have written about it) it seems like Where White People Meet could very well be an attempt by Russell to cash in on outrage. Currently, there are more people talking about the ridiculousness of the site than there are active users. It’s not unlike the racist Star Wars boycott or the Starbucks red cup controversy  that sparked debate toward the end of 2015. Indeed, it gives people an opportunity to prove they’re smarter, more   and not as racist as Where White People Meet is. But the outrage that’s sprung up in response to the website doesn’t really further the conversation about the casual racism that OkCupid has found is inherent in dating. That’s probably not a topic people really want to discuss on Facebook, in 140 characters on  Twitter, or, as OkCupid’s data has shown, in general. It’s easier to simply profess your anger over Russell’s silly site. And that’s something he definitely understands.    ”I knew there was some potential for backlash, but I’m not going to dodge it,” he told the Washington Post. But wait. Where do white people meet if they’re not on Where White People Meet?           White people.

"Larry, Sergey, and the Mixed Legacy of Google-Turned-Alphabet. On August 10, 2015, Google CEO Larry Page shocked the business world by announcing he was restructuring the company he cofounded into a holding company called Alphabet. Page would head the new entity, and Google itself would be one of a number of companies under Alphabet’s control—like Google X, Google Fiber, Google Ventures, and Nest—each with a separate CEO reporting to him. The idea was to make The Company Formerly Known As Google “more clean and accountable.” Now Page and Brin are gone, kind of. In a letter they released on Tuesday, they explained that while they will continue to advise and stay on the board, they are removing themselves from “day to day responsibilities.” That’s an interesting claim, because the Alphabet structure had freed them of a lot of those responsibilities already, allowing them to pursue the bigger, moonshot-y ideas they preferred to corporate wranglings. Brin embedded himself in X, Alphabet’s long-range research division. Page also pursued his passions, while doing a disappearing act that didn’t live up to the “more accountable” part of the bargain. He gave no press interviews, stopped participating in earnings calls, and didn’t even go to the last shareholders meeting. Now Sundar Pichai, while still running Google, will add CEO of Alphabet to his chores, with oversight from the board. He’s inheriting a sprawling entity that’s more determined by the ambitions and fever dreams of the cofounders than what necessarily makes sense for the world’s most important search, video, and artificial intelligence company.  So maybe it’s time to assess how well the Alphabet move worked out. The Alphabet structure seemed motivated by two factors. The first was to allow Page to remove himself from the rigmarole of running the Google business. I used to half-joke that he did it so he’d never have to talk to a reporter again. Now I’m down to 30 percent joke. (Oddly, in interviews—my last with him was in 2013—Page can be fascinating, candid enough to provide an illuminating view of his innovation-obsessed mindset.) The second was to become more friendly to Wall Street, a factor usually attributed to Alphabet’s canny CFO Ruth Porat. Breaking out Google from the as-yet-unprofitable “Other Bets,” like the capital intensive health-care division Verily or new spin-offs like Loon, makes the company’s financial reporting more palatable to bankers and analysts.  Also, by making the individual CEOs responsible for the performance of their domains, they might find themselves more compelled to make their divisions profitable. In one sense this seems to have worked brilliantly. Alphabet’s share price has skyrocketed, roughly doubling since the announcement. Could a non-alphabetized Google have performed better? That depends on whether you think the move made the pieces more valuable, or whether it created a mélange of companies worth less than the sum of its parts.  In the original Google structure, the point of those other ventures was to bolster the mothership itself. In an Alphabetized world, the focus is on incubating companies that will one day become big businesses themselves. It’s the Berkshire Hathaway model, a corporate Gladstone bag where Geico and NetJets and See’s Candies are happily stuffed inside. But Warren Buffet doesn’t have a flagship to nurture. Consider the VC firm Google Ventures. It originally made its investments with a strong eye towards companies that might enhance Google’s business. But by running Ventures as an independent entity, the incentive shifts naturally to wagers that pay off, as opposed to financially less promising bets that would nonetheless make Google more valuable to users. Some might counter that Ventures has reaped hundreds of millions with big wins like Uber; but that haul is relatively insignificant compared with the billions Google brings in every quarter.  Starting a great VC firm is nice, but an investment arm that could accelerate the mature search business might be even better. One clear casualty of Alphabetization is what used to be called Google Fiber. Founded in 2010, its mission was to spread high-speed internet without worrying much about profit, on the theory that the more people had speedy bits, the more they would use Google and YouTube. But when Alphabet started, Fiber moved into a division known as Alphabet Access. Faced with an imposing bottom-line issue, Access has cut back on its initial plans and churned through several CEOs. Sometimes turning a division into an Alphabet company (or acquiring it and not integrating it into the whole) caused more problems than it solved. Nest, for example, was purchased for $3.2 billion in January 2014 because Google wanted to augment its hardware might, especially in the so-called smart home. In the Alphabet world, though, keeping it separate put it in competition with efforts inside the mothership, as some of its efforts ended up overlapping or conflicting with the work of the hardware division inside Google. That was only one case where tensions arose because of redundancy or conflict. Because Google—whose own ambitions are huge—did not control what happened in other divisions, it sometimes had to duplicate what another part of Alphabet was doing. In the case of Nest, the situation was resolved by sucking the smart-home newcomer into Google. But in other cases, duplication continues. Alphabet possesses one of the world’s premier research divisions in X, yet Google now also has its own extensive research operations. Google’s AI resources are unmatched—expect maybe by Deep Mind, an Alphabet company based in London. And what has been the financial impact of giving all that individual responsibility to Other Bet CEOs? To be sure, some of those bets are still very early and may well turn into multibillion-dollar businesses. But as of the most recent quarterly earnings call, four years into the Alphabet experience, the total revenue for all those Other Bets is still less than half a percent of Alphabet’s revenues. Now that Pichai is in charge of both the division that brings in over 99 percent of the cash and all the rest as well, he has the perspective to determine whether the Alphabet experiment has been worth it. Some of the Other Bets fall, in Page’s term, “far afield” of the Google mission. Pichai might wonder why he shouldn’t spin them off with a load of venture money and a promise to send back the loot after an IPO, instead of having to pay attention to them when Google and YouTube have huge internal and external challenges. Even if he does decide Alphabet was a misstep, Pichai doesn’t necessarily have the freedom to make big changes. He’d have a lot of inertia to overcome: Insiders refer to a continental drift occurring where some of the divisions have become less “Googley” as they develop their own cultures. And Google itself now has workplace issues—political protests and me-too problems—that some in the Other Bets might be wary of. Finally, Brin and Page between them still control a majority of Alphabet’s voting shares, so if they are happy with the structure—their farewell letter indicates they are—nothing will change. It all comes down to what kind of enterprise those cofounders and their chosen CEO want. Only they can rethink whether Google/Alphabet is a holding company of disparate parts, or a powerful entity with helpful satellites contributing to its might and mission.  This week’s reset may be the perfect time to wonder whether it makes sense to reset the Scrabble board of letters that Larry and Sergey left behind.",0.0
"Alleged serial killer won’t give up his fingerprints. The man accused of butchering a gay Brooklyn teen in 2005 is still refusing to give up his fingerprints  —   despite a judge’s order they could be taken by force. If Kwauhuru Govan  —      —   continues to resist, he will be forcibly printed sometime Thursday, a law enforcement source said. The Department of Correction declined to comment on why Govan has yet to be printed, or how fingerprints are taken from an involuntary inmate. The   Govan nearly flipped a table last Thursday as prosecutors attempted to arraign him on the murder charge, after he was dragged into court screaming, “They’re framing me for this murder! I can’t even dissect a frog!” Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Neil Firetog declined to arraign him at that time because he refused to be printed. The    was back in court Thursday for another attempt at arraignment, but the case was instead pushed to Friday given the lack of prints. “My understanding is that the defendant was to be brought before me for arraignment, but he has yet to be fingerprinted,” Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Michael Brennan told Govan’s defense attorney, Frederick Spiegel. Govan had been brought to the courthouse, but was relegated to a cell and did not appear before the judge. The hacked limbs of Brazell, an aspiring   designer, were discovered on subway tracks in Feb. 2005  —   three days after he vanished  —   prompting citywide fear that there was a murdering transit worker roaming the subways. Brazell’s torso turned up at a recycling plant a week later, but his head was never found.  Sharabia Thomas, whose naked body was found stuffed into a laundry bag in an alley near her family’s home. He pleaded “not guilty” at the time to charges of   murder and   kidnapping. In the Thomas case, Govan was arrested after units from the NYPD and Brooklyn DA’s office retested the    fingernail clippings, and purported found DNA that had been undetectable with 2004 technology. Govan’s DNA was in the system since he was serving time in a Florida prison for a 2014 armed robbery. In both Brazell and Thomas’ cases, Govan is known to have lived just blocks from their homes in Bushwick and  .  and that investigations are underway to see if he can be linked to other cold cases in Brooklyn, Flordia, and California.",1.0
"Prince didn’t let the music industry define him. That’s why he became a legend..  It’s been one year since Prince’s death. For many of us, his songs will always represent inescapable sadness, bright sparks of joy, metallic moments of excitement, and all the emotions in between.    But what’s also important to remember is that Prince didn’t just create music; He fought for it. In his book, I Would Die 4 U: Why Prince Became an Icon, cultural critic Touré detailed Prince’s groundbreaking life and career. And what struck him as pertinent was Prince’s refusal to be pigeonholed into a genre or have his race determine his stardom. Touré told WBUR:  What Prince and Michael Jackson did, was they said, ’I don’t want to be just famous within the black community, I want the world. I want everything.’   …     Prince came in, and he said to the labels, ’Do not try to just put me with the urban group; I want the world. I want to be with the pop staff. I’m going to make rock and roll, as well as soul, as well as funk   …     I don’t want to just go to Soul Train, I don’t want to just open up for Rick James, I want to be on Dick Clark.’     Touré makes an important point when it comes to appreciating Prince’s legacy.    When Prince began his career in the late ’70s, the music industry was segregated (as is still true today). Black artists would often get stuck into the ”urban” genre because of the color of their skin. And that meant less budget, less marketing, less attention. Prince fought to become a pop star, to become his own artist. He refused to be treated as someone who was less than other (usually white) artists. Prince’s ownership over his music also manifested itself in fights with his record companies, with YouTube, and with streaming services. He even once compared one of his contracts to actual slavery. The relationships he had with his record companies were no doubt contentious and filled with acrimony.    But without Prince’s ambition to shrug off a label, to fight for the best opportunities available to him, and to take his destiny into his own hands, who knows if he would have been the legend he became.

"What Has Tech Done to Fix Its Harassment Problem?. Last year’s national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace began in the tech industry. In the months that followed Susan J. Fowler’s February blog post about sexual harassment at Uber, a number of well-known tech executives—particularly venture capitalists and startup executives—were ousted from positions of power after allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. But with the October downfall of Harvey Weinstein, Hollywood took the lead on the conversation. In the wake of the many reports of harassment in entertainment, the industry launched initiatives, held high-profile protests, and grabbed headlines. Earlier this month, 300 women in Hollywood created Times Up, an anti-harassment initiative that includes a legal-defense fund for victims of harassment. They donned black dresses and pins supporting the effort at the Golden Globes ceremony while speaking out in their acceptance speeches. ",0.0
"Good Friday won’t fall on March 25 again until 2157. Here’s why that matters..  Today is a religious rarity that will not occur again in our lifetimes. For most Christians in the West, it is Good Friday, the day of Jesus’s crucifixion. It is also March 25, the traditional day of observing the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel came to Mary and told her she would become pregnant with Jesus.    This overlap has happened just three times in the 20th century (1910, 1921, and 1932) and twice in the 21st (2005 and 2016). And it won’t occur again until 2157. A March 25 Good Friday presents a tension for Christians It’s a rare event because the Christians use different methods to schedule holy days. Fixed feasts, like Christmas (December 25 in the West) and the Annunciation (March 25) fall on the same day every year. And movable feasts, like Easter, fall on different days depending on the lunar calendar.    A March 25 Good Friday presents a tension for Christians: The Annunciation is a day of joy, when believers celebrate the beginning of Jesus’s earthly life and Mary’s enthusiastic embrace of her role as Christ’s mother: ”Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word,” she told the angel. But Good Friday is the darkest day of the Christian year  —   the day Christ was beaten, nailed to the cross like a common criminal, abandoned by nearly all of his friends and family, and killed. Christians over the centuries have dwelled on the tension that a March 25 Good Friday presents. As Eleanor Parker outlines in a terrific post on her blog, the overlap of the Annunciation and Good Friday fascinated medieval artists. Here is a   illuminated manuscript that shows the crucifixion (on the left) next to the annunciation (on the right):            And when Good Friday fell on March 25 in 1608, John Donne wrote a poem, appropriately titled ”Upon the Annunciation and Passion Falling upon One Day.” He describes ”this doubtful day   Of feast or fast, Christ came and went away.”    The difficulty of honoring both days simultaneously is so great that whenever March 25 falls during the week of Easter, the Catholic Church pushes its Annunciation celebration to later in the year. (This year, the church’s feast of the Annunciation is April 4.) Still, as Parker points out, there’s a richness in the ”paradoxical conjunction of feast and fast.” Even when Good Friday doesn’t fall on March 25, it is mysterious and   for Christians. They mourn the death of Jesus but look forward to his resurrection just a few days later. They grieve his suffering but believe this suffering makes way for great joy: the salvation of the world.

"How Wily Teens Outwit Bathroom Vape Detectors. Last spring, students at Hinsdale Central High School discovered six vaping detectors in bathrooms and locker rooms around campus. About 20 miles southwest of Chicago, Hinsdale Central has been battling on-campus vaping for years. Administrators tried making students take online courses if they were caught with ecigarettes; they talked to law enforcement; the Village of Hinsdale even passed an ordinance that would make it easier for officers to ticket minors caught with the devices. To no avail. And the detectors? Students simply ripped them off the walls. Ecigarettes, which are easy to conceal and, until recently, came in a dazzling array of sweet, fruity, and dessert flavors, are hugely popular among teenagers. A recent study found that 28 percent of high schoolers and 11 percent of middle schoolers frequently vape. So schools across the country are spending thousands of dollars to outfit their campuses with vaping detectors, only to find that the devices can’t stand up to wily teens and that policing student behavior isn’t the same as permanently changing it. Like smoke detectors, vape detectors are relatively unintrusive. They don’t even record video or audio—they just register the chemical signature of vaping aerosol, then send an email or text alert to school officials. Some schools say they’re a useful deterrent. A district in Sparta, New Jersey, started off with two detectors and is planning to install more. Freeman School District in Washington installed detectors a few weeks ago. “They’ve been very effective, and we’re glad we have them,” says superintendent Randy Russell, who noted that the detectors already helped catch one young vaper in the act. But at Hinsdale, even before the teens subjected them to blunt force trauma, the devices hadn’t lived up to expectations. “By the time we get there the kids are gone,” says Kimm Dever, an administrator at Hinsdale Central. Dever says the devices also went off randomly, and administrators couldn’t tell which kids were vaping and which just happened to be in the bathroom when the devices alerted. Revere Schools in Bath, Ohio, reported similar problems. Revere spent around $15,000 to install 16 detectors in its middle and high schools at the beginning of the school year. Parents were thrilled, but administrators rarely made it to the bathroom in time to catch the vapers mid-puff. “It was like chasing ghosts,” says Jennifer Reece, a spokesperson for the school district. In theory, school officials could consult footage from hallway cameras to triangulate which students were in the bathroom when the detectors went off. “That also takes up time, and we don’t always have that type of time” Reece says. Revere bought detectors with grant money from the state Attorney General’s Office. Now, Reece often gets questions from other school districts about the devices. “If they don’t have grant money I don’t know if it’s worth [the cost],” she says. If vaping has become the cool thing to do among students, then buying vape detectors is the big trend for school districts. Derek Peterson, the CEO of Soter Technologies, which makes the Flysense detector that Revere installed, says the company is fielding about 700 orders a month. “We have more schools coming to us than we know what to do with,” he says. IPVideo, which makes a number of cameras and other gadgets for schools, sells a Halo detector that also claims to distinguish between THC and nicotine vapor. The detectors can integrate with school camera systems so it’s easier for administrators to figure out which students are in the bathroom, and both companies’ detectors cost roughly $1,000 a piece. Flysense charges an additional annual fee. The sensors are chemical detectors that go off when the levels of certain chemicals in the room change. Most schools say they do sense the vapor and that they’ve caught students because of them. But kids are clever. Some exhale into their backpacks or sleeves, where the aerosol dissipates before wafting up to the detector. Other kids resort to AP physics–level subterfuge. They exhale into the toilet and flush, creating a vacuum that sucks the aerosol into the pipes. “There’s nothing we can do about that,” says Peterson. “There’s no sensing that could ever change the laws of physics.” The problem is that detectors alone can’t change students’ behavior. It’s important for schools to analyze their goals, says Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a developmental psychologist at Stanford who studies teen vaping. Vape detectors might help catch offending kids so they can be punished, she says, but “if the goal is to prevent and stop, vape detectors are not the way to go.” Peterson agrees and is already getting in on the education angle, offering a #NoVaping package that includes brochures, posters, and suggestions for class presentations. Between 2017 and 2019, the California Department of Justice distributed more than $12 million to California school districts trying to deter vaping through a number of measures including installing detectors, hiring school resource officers, and running educational programs. One of those districts was Las Virgenes Unified, which serves around 11,500 students northwest of Los Angeles. In October 2018, Las Virgenes spent half of its grant, some $50,000, to install Flysense detectors at its two high schools and three middle schools. “The technology is good. They work,” says superintendent Dan Stepenosky. But he combines the detectors with other measures. When students are caught vaping, they’re sent to a 90-minute meeting with their parents and an addiction counselor. The school dispatched administrators to nearby gas stations, grocery stores, and convenience stores to remind people not to sell ecigarettes to kids under 21. The school even partners with law enforcement to run sting operations on businesses in the community that sell ecigarettes to minors. So far they’ve conducted over 250 operations complete with undercover officers and marked bills. But the most important element hasn’t been the sting operations, the crackdowns on local retailers, or the detectors. “The most impactful has been the education piece,” says Stepenosky. The district holds seminars for parents and teachers, and it hired extra deans to focus on student wellness and included information about ecigarettes in school curricula. These strategies are comprehensive, and they demand a lot of resources. One school in South Dakota raised money from the local community to buy its sensors. Other school districts are suing Juul, blaming the company’s marketing for creating a new generation of nicotine-addicted kids. Those districts hope to get payouts that will alleviate the huge financial burden of running addiction counseling and education programs. Stepenosky received over a million dollars from the California Department of Justice, and he’s already applying for more funding for next year.",0.0
"Have top Democrats given up too soon on boosting economic growth?.  Has the mainstream Democratic Party become too pessimistic about the possibility of boosting economic growth?    That’s the more interesting question sparked by economist Gerald Friedman’s analysis suggesting that Bernie Sanders’s economic agenda, if fully enacted, would lead to 5. 3 percent annual GDP growth, soaring household incomes, and an array of other wondrous effects. The Sanders campaign did not produce the analysis or officially endorse it  —   indeed, the Sanders campaign never even framed its proposals as an agenda to boost the growth rate  —   but the campaign did promote it. A bevy of Democratic economists who served as Council of Economic Advisers chairs under either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama pushed back, saying the document is a betrayal of ”our party’s best traditions of   policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic.” But a dissident faction of wonks, including J. W. Mason from John Jay College and Matthew Klein of the Financial Times, spoke up for Friedman, saying that essentially all he was arguing was that the economy could get back on its   growth trend.    When you examine the argument more closely, this fails as a defense of Friedman’s analysis. But it raises a broader and more important question. Has the Obama administration’s economic team  —   and by extension, the entire larger orbit of economists relied on by the Democratic Party  —   wrongly given up on supercharged economic growth?    The debate underscores a change that’s taken place slowly and quietly in the party’s wonkosphere over the past five years. There’s been a shift from frustration that Congress won’t let the president enact his awesome   agenda to a view that we are doing about as well as we could be. These days, the White House’s favorite economic policy stories aren’t favorable coverage of its exciting   plans but stories like Michael Grunwald’s ”Everything Is Awesome,” ”Seriously, Everything Is Pretty Awesome,” and ”Everything Is (Even More) Awesome!” which declare victory in the war on recession and stagnation.    But are things truly awesome, or are they just okay? What’s worse, is it possible that Democrats trying to justify their economic performance have lost sight of the difference? Gerald Friedman and the output gap The crucial defense of Friedman’s paper comes from this chart, composed by Matthew Klein, which shows that   growth would simply return the US economy to its   trend level by the end of Sanders’s second term.            Obviously there’s no guarantee that Sanders’s program would actually accomplish this. But Klein’s chart raises the question of whether it really makes sense to snippily dismiss the goal as somehow obviously unrealistic  —   which is more or less what Friedman’s (and Sanders’s) critics have done.    Everyone agrees that a depressed economy can see growth return to its   trend level. Viewed this way, Friedman is simply saying that Sanders’s agenda will be adequately stimulative to get the economy back on track and close the ”output gap”  —   the gap between what the economy is producing right now and what it could be producing if all its resources were fully employed. Friedman’s problem: Economic stimulus isn’t a time machine As a narrow defense of Friedman’s specific paper arguing for specific effects from Sanders’s specific policies, this is not really persuasive. There are many small nits one could pick with his analysis, because what he essentially does is choose optimistic assumptions at every possible turn, but there are two really big problems with it. One is that Friedman assumes there will be no     impacts of any of Sanders’s policies initiatives. You don’t need to be hostile to Sanders’s goals or policies to see that this isn’t the case. For example, if you make Social Security more generous while also giving people free health care and raising taxes, some people are going to retire earlier. This is a feature of Sanders’ agenda (early retirement is nice) not a bug. But by reducing the number of people in the labor force, it will slow the rate of GDP growth.  Sanders’s plan to make college free has the same feature. Reducing the price will increase the number of young people who go to school and decrease the amount of   work that college students do. The other problem is that 2007 was nine years ago, and economic stimulus isn’t a time machine.    As University of California economist Brad DeLong puts it, ”We can’t wave a magic demand wand now and get the recovery we threw away in 2009.” With every year that the economy didn’t enjoy rapid convergence to the trend line, we missed out on business investment and public investment that the trend line assumed would happen and lay the foundation for future growth. With every year the unemployment rate stayed elevated, we had people out of a job failing to gain skills and experience that they otherwise would have had. Opportunities missed for this long are, at this point, genuinely missed. DeLong believes we could have had rapid snapback growth if the government had adopted sufficiently stimulative policies in 2009 or 2010. Reasonable people can disagree about how much of the opportunity has vanished in the subsequent years, but Friedman’s implicit argument that none of it has vanished is almost certainly too optimistic. The bigger question: Could very different policy lead to much faster growth? What’s striking is that the Federal Reserve, which, unlike academic economists loosely affiliated with the Sanders campaign, is actually in a position to do something about it, seems to think that the output gap is now essentially closed. There’s nothing we can do on the demand side of the economy to get closer to the old   trajectory. That, at least, is the implication of its decision to raise the central bank’s benchmark interest rate in December. You raise rates to reduce demand and slow the economy. By raising rates late last year, the Fed was saying the economy was at risk of growing too fast in the near future and producing inflation  —   a theory that would only make sense if you believed the output gap was tiny or nonexistent. The Obama administration takes a somewhat different view. Pointing, for example, to the 3. 1 percentage point decline in the share of the population that has a job, they still see room for countercyclical policy to boost employment and growth. But not much room. The most recent Economic Report of the President attributed just 0. 2 percentage points of the 3. 1 percentage point total to cyclical effects:               The lion’s share of the decline, they think, represents the aging of the population. But what’s really interesting is the large  —   and growing  —   share of the gap that they attribute to a mysterious ”residual” not identified as the business cycle weakness by their statistical methods. A conservative critic of the Obama administration, like Casey Mulligan, author of The Redistribution Recession, would likely argue that this residual reflects the malign influence of   taxes and welfare state expansion, which have blunted people’s incentive to work. Conversely, a believer in     growth would say that the White House economists are simply selling stimulus short  —   we had a collapse in demand that’s never been adequately made up, and at the same time we’ve seen an increase in the number of   people who aren’t working. There’s no mysterious residual here, just poor management of the business cycle that better policy could overcome. The specter of secular stagnation A perhaps surprising source of support for Sanders’s general view of the situation  —   though presumably not his candidacy  —   is Larry Summers, formerly Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and National Economic Council chair under Obama. Summers has been a hate figure for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party for more than a decade now, and they scuttled his potential nomination to replace Ben Bernanke at the head of the Fed. But in recent years he’s developed the view that the entire world economy is suffering from what he calls ”secular stagnation”  —   a persistent shortfall in demand that is reflected in the combination of slow growth, low interest rates, and low inflation currently seen in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Summers’s solution to this problem would fit very nicely in the Sanders playbook:     Traditional concern with fiscal deficits has focused on their impact in pushing up interest rates and retarding investment. Yet by setting yields so low and bond prices so high, markets are sending a clear signal that they want more, not less, government debt. By stimulating growth and enabling an inflation increase that would permit a reduction in real capital costs, fiscal expansion now would crowd investment in rather than out.   proposals to curtail prospective pension benefits, in contrast, might make matters even worse by encouraging increased saving and reduced consumption, thus exacerbating secular stagnation. The main constraint on the industrial world’s economy today is on the demand, rather than the supply, side. This means that measures that increase potential supply by promoting flexibility are therefore less important than measures that offer the potential to increase demand, such as regulatory reform and business tax reform. Other structural policies that would promote demand include steps to accelerate investments in renewable technologies that could replace fossil fuels and measures to raise the share of total income going to those with a high propensity to consume, such as support for unions and increased minimum wages. Thus, John Maynard Keynes, writing in a similar situation during the late 1930s, rightly emphasized the need for policy approaches that both promoted business confidence —  the cheapest form of stimulus —  and increased labor compensation.  In a somewhat similar vein, Narayana Kocherlakota, until recently the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, argues that not only are interest rates low, but the share of total national income accruing to workers is also abnormally low.         This combination of cheap capital and cheap labor means, according to Kocherlakota, that there ”is no technological reason why real gross domestic product (GDP) cannot grow at a materially   rate over the next decade.” But it won’t just happen by magic or good luck. Public policy would need to deliberately try to foster   growth, most likely through a combination of stimulative fiscal policy and a Federal Reserve willing to let wages rise faster than labor productivity in order to make up the lost ground in the labor share of national income. Sanders has not exactly endorsed this idea, but he has stood out from the crowd by calling for a more   Federal Reserve and is certainly the candidate in the field who seems most likely to want to try a range of aggressive economic policies. A debate worth having In this way, Friedman’s somewhat silly paper has managed to spark a debate over a critically important issue that’s been largely absent from the Democratic primary: What, if anything, can be done to accelerate economic growth, at least in the short term, and make up some of the ground lost during the Great Recession?    Sanders’s economic policy proposals are not really framed as stimulus in this way, and Friedman’s case for their stimulative impact is likely overrated. But while the Clinton campaign has been happy to revel in criticism of Friedman’s work, it hasn’t come out with its own better and more rigorous plan for boosting growth. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has largely given up on blaming congressional Republicans for blocking   measures and simply turned to touting the real, albeit limited, success of the current recovery. Promising to raise the growth rate to 5 percent on an ongoing basis looks ridiculous, but aiming for that kind of   over a year or two, though difficult to pull off, isn’t a crazy idea at all. At a time of nearly unprecedented mass discontent with established political leaders and institutions, in other words, the mainstream Democratic Party is going with the message that things right now are about as good as they’re going to get.

"Gary Johnson wins Libertarian presidential nomination.        ORLANDO  —   Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson won the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination on Sunday, fending off five rivals from different factions on two closely fought ballots and securing more than 55. 8 percent of the total vote. “I will work as hard as I can to represent everyone in this room,” Johnson said after his victory. “After this convention, people will be looking to us to describe what it means to be a Libertarian. And I realize it will be up to me to tell them. ” But Johnson’s   on the first ballot kicked off an afternoon of protests and delegate   with the vice presidential race to be decided later. Johnson had run a careful campaign with an eye on the general election, picking former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld  —   like him, a Republican who switched parties  —   as his running mate. In Saturday night’s debate, Johnson, alone among the   contenders, said that he would have signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and that he thought people should be licensed to drive cars. He was loudly booed for both positions. “I liked it,” Johnson said in an interview before Sunday’s vote. “Let’s draw attention to the only candidate onstage saying that he would sign the Civil Rights Act, let’s draw attention to the only candidate onstage who’s in favor of driver’s licenses. I don’t know about you guys, but I think that’s a great distinction between myself and the rest of them. ” Those positions were tough to swallow for some of the party’s   radicals. They’d spent the campaign season  —   including more than a dozen debates  —   labeling Johnson a “ ” candidate who could not expand on the 1 percent of the vote he had won as the 2012 nominee. Johnson was silent when the first ballot showed him just six votes short of a majority.

They briefly huddled on the convention floor and worked delegates, as Johnson had unfruitful conversations with critics and then walked outside for an interview with MSNBC. “It’s not unique to the Libertarian Party that we have factions,” Johnson said. “When Republicans and Democrats get to this stage of the process, they’ve already gone through their primaries. You don’t hear much of a contrast. In the case of Libertarians  —   not so much. ”   ”Hold on to your delegates,” Peterson tells McAfee.

Democracy is coming to the USA pic. twitter.   —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) May 29, 2016  The scrum quieted down for Johnson to do the interview. But when it ended, Petersen gave chase and pulled Johnson aside  —   in full view of reporters. “Do you want to unite the party?” Petersen asked. “This is not the place, Austin,” said Johnson, referring to the media attention. “Why did you pick Bill Weld?” Petersen asked.   Petersen confronts Johnson about the Weld choice. ”This is not the place,” says Johnson, walking away. pic. twitter.   —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) May 29, 2016  Johnson shook his head and walked away, as Petersen denounced Weld as a “horrible statist” and argued with a Johnson supporter who said that, at 35, Petersen was too young to represent the party. “Tell that to Marquis de Lafayette,” Petersen said. “He was 18. ” Meanwhile, Johnson was securing the votes of Libertarian delegates who had cast sympathy ballots for   candidates. Johnson gained 60 votes on the second ballot, while Marc Allan Feldman, a   physician who just that morning had helped people injured by a    driver, lost 40 votes between ballots.   Final vote count pic. twitter.   —   daveweigel (@daveweigel) May 29, 2016  Johnson’s victory began the race for vice president, which promised drama of its own. Weld, who had made a fitful Libertarian run for governor of New York in 2006, was not otherwise tied to the party. As he did interviews and met delegates, he made up ground but acknowledged that he did not always align with the party base. After the first presidential ballot, Weld said in a short interview that he had finally read the LP’s platform and disagreed with part of it. “It’s pretty good,” he said. “They want to eliminate the income tax; that wouldn’t bring in enough revenue. I’m for a flat tax. ” What was unclear, as the vice presidential fight began, was who could overtake Weld. The candidates for vice president were a mixture of obscure activists. McAfee ruled out running for the second spot on the ticket; Petersen said he would do it only if Johnson fired his campaign staff. In his victory speech, Johnson beseeched the delegates to look past any of their ideological qualms with Weld to consider the breakthrough the party could win if it nominated two former Republicans. Weld, he said, had done 25 major media interviews since agreeing to run. That was 25 more interviews than Jim Gray, a judge who became Johnson’s 2012 running mate, ever did. “I realize it’s up to you,” Johnson said. “If it’s not Bill Weld, I don’t think we have the opportunity to be elected president of the United States. ”",-0.5
"NASA's James Webb Space Telescope Plagued by Delays, Rising Costs. For the past decade, astronomers have been waiting for a remarkable new instrument to enter the world. The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched to 1 million miles beyond Earth’s orbit, further than any telescope yet, where it can observe the deepest corners of the universe. Once there it will unfurl a sunshield to protect special sensors that can detect images giving off the faint glow of far infrared light. From its perch in space, the scope will be able to see the universe’s most distant objects, including stars that formed right after the Big Bang and whose light is just now reaching us. But scientists will have to wait still longer to zoom into Jupiter’s great red spot, or hunt for exoplanets circling distant solar systems. On Wednesday, NASA officials released findings of a review panel looking at construction and testing of the James Webb Space Telescope. There were lots of problems—delicate propulsion valves damaged by the wrong cleaning solvent, loose screws (70 of them!) that came off during a shake test—that have cost $600 million and an 18-month delay. Cumulatively, the project has now been delayed by three years, at a cost of more than $9.6 billion. And two of the screws are still missing. ",0.0
"It’s official: Ivanka Trump will be a White House staffer.  Ivanka Trump’s power behind the scenes in the White House is now really, truly official. The president’s daughter, who already had a West Wing Office, a security clearance, and a   phone, will become an unpaid government employee with the title of special assistant to the president, according to the New York Times.     That title is a shift from her earlier plans, which would have given her the office and the clearance without the official status. As a White House employee, even an unpaid one, Trump, like her husband, Jared Kushner, will have to abide by federal ethics regulations. Her appointment is pure nepotism: There is nothing on her résumé that suggests Ivanka Trump is qualified, by any traditional definition of the term, to advise the president of the United States. But for President Donald Trump she has two qualities that likely outweigh any others  —   she’s a Trump, and she’s going to be loyal to him. Ivanka Trump, who is 35 and has a bachelor’s degree in business, is best known for running a relatively small apparel line branded with her name, for appearing on The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice alongside her father, and for writing a   advice book, The Trump Card.       By all accounts, she was a capable lieutenant to her father at the Trump Organization, where she oversaw global expansion and the development of the president’s hotel in Washington, DC’s Old Post Office building. Still, this is not the type of résumé most White House jobs are built on. She’ll have access to   information about national security, and, according to Politico, her portfolio of issues won’t be confined to the family policy she spent most of her campaign trail time discussing.    Ivanka Trump’s role, her lawyer told Politico, is to be her father’s “eyes and ears” in the White House. In an administration that spent its first two months riven by very public leaks and infighting, Trump has apparently decided, as he did in his business career, that his own children are the only people he can really trust.  Nepotism is illegal  —   but the Trump administration has decided it doesn’t apply to the White House Giving Ivanka Trump a West Wing office might be nepotism. But it’s not illegal nepotism. The Justice Department ruled that federal   laws don’t apply to the president’s choice of White House advisers. The day Trump was inaugurated, the Justice Department determined that it would be legal for him to appoint Jared Kushner, his    and Ivanka Trump’s husband.    “A President wanting a relative’s advice on governmental matters therefore has a choice: to seek that advice on an unofficial, ad hoc basis without conferring the status and imposing the responsibilities that accompany formal White House positions,” the Justice Department’s Daniel Koffsky, a deputy assistant attorney general, wrote, “or to appoint his relative to the White House under title 3 and subject him to substantial restrictions against conflicts of interest. ” In other words: Trump is going to get advice from his relatives anyway, so he might as well get it in a role that puts some ethical restrictions around what they can do. Congress passed a federal   law in the 1960s. Before that, the only unusual thing about an appointment like Trump’s would be that she was the president’s daughter  —   not the president’s brother or the president’s son.     John F. Kennedy made his brother Robert attorney general and put his    Sargent Shriver, in charge of the Peace Corps. Dwight D. Eisenhower’s son worked in the White House as an assistant staff secretary. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s son James served as secretary of the president, an important coordinating job akin to the modern position of chief of staff. (In an episode with additional resonance for Trump watchers, James Roosevelt was also accused of profiting personally from his father’s presidency and had to publish his tax returns to prove he had not.)  Then in 1967, a federal   law reforming the Post Office prohibited executive branch officials from appointing their relatives to jobs in the agencies they oversee. Legal experts disagree on whether the law applies to the president and to jobs in the White House. But some presidents have decided to play it safe: When President Bill Clinton tapped Hillary Clinton to oversee his health care overhaul, he put her in charge of a task force rather than giving her an official White House job.  Today, Kushner and Ivanka Trump have already disclosed information about their finances and divested from some stocks as part of Kushner’s White House role, according to Politico. As an official White House employee, she’ll also be bound by regulations on financial disclosures and conflicts of interest. Is Ivanka Trump’s new job a win for the “Democrats” in the White House? Since the campaign, Ivanka Trump has assiduously cultivated an image as the voice of moderation, even liberalism, whispering in her father’s ear. It reached its pinnacle when she told the Republican National Convention that her father believed in affordable child care and equal pay for equal work  —   issues that a Republican president had never put at the center of his campaign. That influence had limits: Trump has not made child care the center of his legislative agenda. Still, for the observers and pundits who constantly scan for a “pivot,” a sign that Trump is moving away from his most extreme positions and rhetoric, there will be a temptation to interpret Ivanka Trump’s West Wing office as the latest sign of moderation. Kushner, as well as fellow New Yorkers Gary Cohn and Dina Powell, former Goldman Sachs executives, are seen as the moderate voices in the Trump administration; according to the Washington Post’s Philip Rucker and Robert Costa, their rivals have taken to calling them “the Democrats. ” The narrative of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner nudging the president to the center can be overblown. But Kushner, Trump, and their allies have leaked to reporters a counterfactual history of how much more extreme Trump’s decisions would have been if they weren’t there to put on the brakes.     According to media reports, Kushner and Trump pushed for an executive order on climate to be less critical of the Paris climate deal. Another report has them successfully derailing another executive order that would have made it easier for businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Ivanka Trump, according to reports, persuaded her father to embrace the less bellicose tone he employed in his speech to a joint session of Congress, rather than the bleak imagery from his inaugural address. She attended a play about welcoming immigrants with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  The image of Kushner and Ivanka Trump as the (relatively) progressive adults in the room is so enduring that for the first few weeks of Trump’s presidency, political observers even held them responsible for the presidents’ tweets. A slew of speculative articles suggested the president tended to send his most zany tweets on Friday nights and Saturdays because Trump and Kushner, who are Orthodox Jews, were observing Shabbat and weren’t there to stop him.  Rabbis, including the rabbi who oversaw Ivanka Trump’s conversion to Judaism, finally debunked this interpretation: Nothing is stopping Kushner and his wife from talking about the president’s tweets, even during the religious observance, they told Politico.  More broadly, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner might be winning occasional battles. But if their goal is to shape President Trump’s administration into one that actively fights climate change and protects the rights of LGBTQ people, they’re losing the war.  The Trump administration is trying to eliminate the federal government’s ability to oppose climate change through its budget. It abolished protections for transgender students in   schools. If Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner truly felt these were morally monstrous decisions, they could resign.  Instead, they’ve been able to have their cake and eat it too: participating in the administration that set these policy moves in motion, while making themselves the stars of a narrative about the people who tried to stand up to them.     The right way to think about this move isn’t ideological  —   it’s that Trump only trusts his family The most likely explanation for Ivanka’s new office and security clearance, though, isn’t that Trump is beefing up the moderate faction within his administration. It’s that despite his claims to hire the “best people,” the only people Trump ever really trusts are those related to him by blood or marriage. It’s easy to understand why Trump might feel like he needs “eyes and ears,” the role Ivanka is supposed to play, in the West Wing. Usually an incoming presidential administration is at least somewhat united by a common purpose, and doesn’t degenerate into public kvetching and backstabbing until it’s suffered some setbacks. Trump’s administration got there in less than a week.  The White House and federal agencies have both a   number of employees and an   number of factions, all of whom apparently spend an inordinate amount of time on the phone to reporters leaking unflattering details about one another. The situation is so bad that several meetings meant to crack down on leaking have immediately been reported in full by the media after details about the   meetings were leaked. “Hire the best people,” Donald Trump wrote in his 2007 book Think Big and Kick Ass, “and don’t trust them. ” Trump’s definition of the “best people” is idiosyncratic at best. But in business and throughout the campaign, he leans on his family to an unusual degree. Trump’s three grown children  —   Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka  —   are in their 30s and 40s, but they all work for their father. When he stepped away from the    operations of his company to serve as president, Donald Trump put Eric and Donald Jr. in charge. Another president who wants a loyal lieutenant in the West Wing might pick a longtime colleague or even a friend, as Barack Obama did with Valerie Jarrett. Trump has relatively few of those tight, nonfamilial connections. What he does have is his family.  ",-1.0
"Can This Man Help Uber Recover From the Travis Kalanick Era?. In the late 1950s, a weapons maker called the Martin Company received a contract to build the first Pershing missile. It was to be the most sophisticated mobile weapons system on earth: 5 tons of metal and precision technology designed to deliver a nuclear warhead from up to 460 miles away. Should it ever be used, there would be no margin for error. It had to be perfect. And the US Army wanted it delivered quickly. The task of ensuring this timely perfection fell to Philip Crosby, a quality-control manager at Martin. To break with his industry’s wartime habit of tolerating small mistakes in feverish production, Crosby came up with a philosophy he would later call Zero Defects. The idea was, basically, to instill in workers the will to prevent problems during design and manufacture rather than go back and fix them later. Crosby’s philosophy went on to become a management buzzword, especially in the aerospace and auto industries, where a faulty gasket or a weak bearing could mean a fiery catastrophe. During the Apollo program, NASA even gave out little Zero Defects trophies—each one a cute pewter spaceman standing on the moon with the letters “ZD” emblazoned on his chest. “I’m a big believer in the Zero Defects strategy,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber. It was an overcast day in January, and Khosrowshahi leaned back in a chair at Uber’s San Francisco headquarters. Khosrowshahi had been running Uber for four months at that point. He’d left a stable perch at Expedia, the travel-­booking service, to take over a company that had become synonymous with scandal and rule-breaking excess. And, having doused some of the raging fires left behind by his predecessor, Travis Kalanick, Khosrowshahi had determined that what Uber needed most was a quality-control philosophy borrowed from the middle of the last century. This was, it must be said, a bit weird. Tech companies tend to celebrate the inverse of Zero Defects. Push out new code, experiment, screw things up, and fix them. “Move fast and break things,” as Mark Zuckerberg famously said in the early days of Facebook. And arguably, few companies have moved faster and broken more things than Uber. In just nine years, Kalanick’s company grew from a vague notion that anyone should be able to summon a ride from their phone into a business valued at $54 billion and available in more than 600 cities on six continents. And it kept adding new services: Today Uber can facilitate a carpool to work and deliver your Dos Toros burritos so they’re still hot when they reach your table. Not satisfied with merely replacing taxis, Kalanick’s Uber began developing autonomous cars and trucks and even set up a skunkworks for flying electric cars. Along the way, the company left a trail of wreckage. It disregarded and even undermined laws and regulations; it squandered the loyalty of its drivers, who felt mistreated under its contractor system; and it became notorious for a workplace culture that exemplified the worst tendencies of the Silicon Valley bro. By the time investors moved to demand Kalanick’s resignation in June 2017, observers were calling Uber the world’s most dysfunctional startup. But where others saw Uber’s travails as a symbol of Silicon Valley comeuppance, Khosrowshahi saw something less loaded: a sophisticated tech company that had taken on too much, too quickly, and whose systems groaned under the weight and confusion. Growth, not quality, had been its guiding principle for too long, he said. Khosrowshahi, 48, has a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. On that day in January, he wore a long-sleeved black crewneck sweater, black pants, loafers, and brightly colored striped socks. In contrast to Kala­nick, who is an inveterate pacer, he sat very still with his ankle crossed over his knee. Khosrowshahi’s vision for Uber, as he relayed it, was to ask people to do their jobs correctly every single day. “It’s a game of inches,” he said. At the time, Khosrowshahi was referring to the need to fix small-bore things—a rider has to wait a few minutes longer than the app promised, a driver can’t get help with a technical issue—that add up to larger reputational problems. Then, in mid-March, came a true catastrophe. An Uber car operating in self-driving mode struck and killed a woman crossing the street in Tempe, Arizona. Within a few hours, the company announced that it was suspending its testing of driverless vehicles. When this article went to press, there was no official answer as to what had gone wrong, or whether quality controls would have made a difference. But suddenly, getting things right, every single time, seemed a lot more consequential. At the San Francisco headquarters, senior product manager Jayanth Mahalingam (sitting/left) and engineering manager Haider Razvi (standing/right) work on the company's mapping team. The story of Uber is so well known now that it feels almost like a parable: Kalanick, a reader of Ayn Rand and self-styled badass, teamed up with a friend to start a service that would help their buddies get around San Francisco “like ballers.” Uber blasted through every expectation to become a new genre of company, inspiring a bonanza of “Like Uber, but for X” clones (along with direct competitors like Lyft and, in China, Didi). The company came to embody a culture in which almost anything was acceptable. In a 2013 email instructing employees not to party too hard during a retreat in Miami, Kalanick summed up the ethos: “We do not have a budget to bail anyone out of jail. Don’t be that guy. #clm”— internet slang for “career limiting move.” The subtext: Your career won’t be limited by bad behavior, so long as it stops short of arrest. Kalanick also fostered an undercurrent of paranoia and suspicion in the ranks. He had architects design difficult-to-find conference rooms at the end of dead-end hallways. The glass partitions were often covered over with paper, and inside small groups of people worked, empowered to launch new projects that no one else at the company knew about. This cloak-and-dagger behavior extended outside the company. Richard Jacobs, a former Uber security employee, asserted that in 2016 the company hacked into competitors’ networks, impersonated riders on their platforms, secretly recorded people, and communicated internally using the encrypted Wickr app “for the express purpose of destroying evidence of illegal or unethical practices,” as Jacobs’ lawyer wrote in a letter in May of last year. (Uber says it hasn’t substantiated those claims but intends to “compete honestly and fairly” going forward.) To Kalanick, any outward display of insecurity was a liability. He didn’t show it, nor did he tolerate it in others. He ran toward conflict, an attitude that helped the company push into new markets, and inspired staffers to put in long hours. But when Uber began to enter a tailspin—as it did precipitously in early 2017—this approach no longer conveyed authority. The final unraveling of Kalanick’s reign started the week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president. On January 27, Trump signed an executive order barring people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. Protests sprang up all over, and New York City taxi drivers went on a one-hour work stoppage at JFK Airport to protest the ban. Uber, however, kept its drivers on the road, fueling the perception that the company was profiteering. A #deleteuber social media campaign went viral, and more than 200,000 people wiped out their accounts. Things got much worse from there. In February a former Uber engineer named Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging that her manager had propositioned her and that, when she complained to human resources, the company not only failed to act but lied to her and other women about his history of transgressions. The company, she wrote, defended the harasser as a “high performer.” Uber was in full-on crisis, and it didn’t have systems in place to fix itself. Just days later, another crisis hit. Waymo, the self-driving division of Alphabet, ­Google’s parent company, filed a suit against Uber, charging that the company had stolen trade secrets and technology. Then, in March, The New York Times revealed that Uber had used a secret software tool to circumvent government inspections. That same week, a video surfaced in which Kalanick sat, legs splayed, between two female companions in the back of an upscale Uber Black car. When he berated the driver, he didn’t come off as powerful. He came off as an asshole. By then, Uber was in full-on crisis, and it didn’t have systems in place to fix itself. For six months there had been no head of human resources. Liane Hornsey, who’d worked at Google in its fast-growth days, finally came aboard in January, just three weeks before Fowler published her post. Hornsey remembers attending her first all-hands meeting the next Tuesday. It was then that she realized the enormity of the task ahead. As Kalanick—the guy who’d referred to his startup in a 2014 GQ article as “Boob-er,” for the way it delivered women to him on demand—promised that things would get better, she watched a range of emotions play across employees’ faces from her seat on the stage. “There were people crying,” she recalls. In the following weeks, Hornsey held listening groups. Many people began reporting their own mistreatment, while others defended Kalanick. Hornsey received 215 complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination, bullying, or retaliation. More than 20 people lost their jobs. As scandal and reports of feuding between Kalanick and his board surfaced in the press, the company’s midlevel managers struggled to hold together what’s known at Uber as “the marketplace”—the network of drivers and riders, as mediated by the company’s technology. Daniel Graf, who worked in the product division, recalled “nonstop fire drills” during this period. His team knew the problem: The Uber app’s technological foundation needed an overhaul. Because the company had built its tech for a smaller service and added to it rapidly as Uber expanded, it had to be fortified and rebuilt. Meanwhile, the senior managers kept disappearing. Kalanick asked Graf to head the product division after his predecessor resigned abruptly. Then, on June 20, after a long battle with investors on his board, Kalanick resigned.“I had three bosses in one week,” Graf said. It was a destabilizing time. Both Hornsey and Graf were named to a 14-person executive leadership team that ran the company while the board looked for a new CEO. Some, like Hornsey, were new. Others, like Graf, had been promoted when their bosses left or were fired. Among them were a vocal group of Kalanick supporters, who felt that even if he had been a belligerent jerk, his vision was essential to Uber’s future. Most knew little about any part of the company other than their own. There was nothing glamorous about leading a fast-growing tech company by committee. The business was in chaos; Uber lost about 10 points in North American market share in less than a year. The team agreed that Uber was doing too much. It needed to address the basics. “We put 100 projects on pause right away,” Graf remembers. One project they prioritized, however, was building a new app for drivers, codenamed Carbon. As head of human resources, Liane Hornsey received 215 complaints about sexual harassment, retaliation, bullying, or discrimination. Of all those Uber has managed to anger—regulators, cabbies, riders—it has done worst by its own drivers. Treated as contractors, not employees, drivers have complained that they can’t make enough money under Uber’s pricing system. They have protested the service’s constantly changing rules. They’ve been frustrated when no one at Uber has helped to resolve problems quickly. At best, Kalanick seemed to ignore them, and at worst he intimated they’d be eventually replaced by autonomous vehicles. By the start of 2017, the company recognized it had a problem. Only a quarter of the people who’d signed up to drive for Uber were still doing so a year later, according to news reports. Uber hadn’t made it easy for them. It hadn’t overhauled its driver app since 2015, and in that time it had added new services like Eats, in which drivers deliver food. To find their way, drivers had to switch back and forth between Uber and mapping apps like Waze, creating friction and frustration. Anything that goes wrong—a rider is standing on the other side of a busy intersection, say, or a carpool rider asks for a different drop-off spot—costs time, which is money. The goal of Carbon—the new driver app—was to foster a perfectly efficient ride that would reduce the chance a driver would also drive for Lyft. But there was no way to roll out a driver app quickly, or even sort of fast. As Graf had found, the technology under­lying the app needed a total rebuild. There was also much more to address beyond building a sturdy tech foundation. To achieve maximum efficiency, Uber needed to create a map of a constantly changing world exactly as it exists in any given moment. A garbage truck is blocking a lane. There’s road work. A fender bender stops traffic for half an hour. All of these things can slow a driver down. And Uber provides rides in real time. Order a package on Amazon and you hope it’ll arrive tomorrow. Order a ride on Uber and you hope it’s already here. With newer food delivery and also carpooling services, the challenges grow exponentially. Say a driver is delivering a burger. How do they locate an apartment on the seventh floor of one of several buildings in an apartment complex? Where do they leave the car while making the drop-off? The challenge of simply locating customers in three-­dimensional space is huge. Consider the blue dot that signals where you are when you open the app as a rider. If you’ve been using Uber for a while, you’ve probably noticed that the placement of that blue dot is more accurate than it used to be. But it still often locates you pretty far from where you are in real life, particularly when you’re in a dense city. Uber— or, more specifically, Danny Iland and Andrew Irish, whose startup, ShadowMaps, was bought by Uber in 2016—are working on that gnarly problem. Khosrowshahi's deliberate pace makes some people uncomfortable. Mapping services typically use the government-owned Global Positioning System, but GPS, Iland explains, was designed for things that fly or sail. Buildings can block your phone from receiving satellite signals, which can cause your phone to misidentify your location. Uber, along with many other mapping companies, has tried to solve this problem through map-­matching, which combines GPS data with mapping software from a number of sources to guess your location. But it’s far from perfect. Iland and Irish, who were PhD students at UC Santa Barbara when they started Shadow­Maps, use a different process. They superimpose the signals your phone is picking up against a 3-D map—a technique called occlusion modeling—so they can see which signals are coming from satellites that have you in their direct line of sight. They combine the data points from those satellites to make a more accurate guess about your location. The process can even correctly identify whether you’re on the south or north side of the street. This is just one of the technologies Uber is developing to improve maps and navigation. Another uses digital imagery to improve the accuracy of a driver’s estimated time of arrival. A different team is trying to improve the navigation system for drivers. Carbon needed to combine these efforts elegantly, a process that would take at least 18 months. But in 2017, as competitors tried to lure Uber’s disgruntled drivers to their services, the company began introducing a series of small changes that drivers wanted. Riders could now tip, and drivers could organize their lives a bit better by setting in advance a general location for a few pickups each day, a feature known as Star Power. Uber also provided a phone line so drivers could speak to a customer service rep rather than sending urgent emails into the ether. These changes bought Uber some time to build and test Carbon, but also introduced glitches. Over the summer, the new features had altered the delicate balance of demand and supply, so that riders were waiting slightly longer for pickups in some markets. At first it was hard to tell which features were responsible. Then, in August, the company put out a Star Power update that let drivers choose six daily destinations. If a driver wanted to, say, end up near their child’s school around 3 pm, they could request a trip in that direction. It was such a good idea that too many drivers used it. Gradually it became obvious that allowing drivers to choose so many daily destinations was the problem. The Star Power update came in the same month that Khosrowshahi was named Uber’s CEO. He leaned on the product team to solve the wait-time problem. Yuhki Yamashita worked on one of Uber’s big priorities—a new app that would keep drivers from jumping to the competition. One day in January, three months before Carbon was due to roll out, Yuhki Yamashita, a senior product manager, kicked off a presentation about the driving app. Half a dozen engineers and product managers sat around a conference table made from a live-edged black walnut slab. A team member beamed in via videoconference from the Los Angeles office. Graf, Yamashita’s boss, was at the table too. After testing Carbon for months, they’d finally arrived at a working beta version and had tested it with drivers, and they were ready to show Khosrowshahi. As Yamashita described drivers’ reactions to the app’s improved features, Khosrowshahi leaned forward, elbow on table, chin in palm, a furrow deepening between his eyebrows. He seemed worried. Remember that in Uber lingo the “marketplace” is the platform where data is collected and processed to determine everything about how Uber works—from pricing to the routes drivers are encouraged to travel. Khosrowshahi jumped in during Yamashita’s presentation to ask whether any of the new features could “eff with the marketplace.” (Khosrowshahi is a man who doesn’t often swear.) Yamashita responded that, sure, any number of features could alter marketplace dynamics. He described a new pop-up bubble that was intended to predict the number of minutes a driver would have to wait until the next ride request. If the wait is too long, a driver might head to a different neighborhood or pull up a competitor’s app. With 3 million drivers completing 15 million rides every day, any small change could ripple through a system in unexpected ways. Khosrowshahi reminded everyone that a new technology platform is usually a disaster at first. Why compound those difficulties by introducing so many new features? “I know we think they’re really cool, but I would first roll this out with some features off — the features that might affect the marketplace,” he said. “If something happens, we’re not going to know why.” Yamashita exchanged a quick glance with Graf, who sat at the corner of the table, his laptop flipped open. Most of the team remained poker-faced. Moving products into the world slowly was not how Uber had become a worldwide phenomenon in just nine years. Yamashita had already noted that the team had been testing the app for 12 weeks. They’d launched beta versions with more than 500 drivers in six cities. They’d gone on ride-alongs and set up WhatsApp chats between engineers and drivers. This was way more testing than he’d ever done in his three years at Uber. “Usually we just do an A/B test, think it’s fine, and then start rolling it out,” he said. Khosrowshahi was unmoved. Still fresh in his mind was the amount of time it took to isolate which feature had caused riders to wait longer over the summer. “Dude, with Star Power we found out four months later,” Khosrowshahi said. That would have been less likely had the company rolled out features more systematically. Khosrowshahi would rather go at a pace slow enough to hit perfection than tolerate pretty good. In other words, something like Zero Defects. But these values are so antithetical to the way Uber’s engineers have worked that even if the people gathered around the table wanted to work differently, they might not know how to go about it. As the meeting wrapped up, Yamashita and Graf acquiesced. Graf suggested the rollout could move a bit more deliberately. “Let’s see if we can stage it a little more,” he said, marking the compromise on which, temporarily, they agreed to settle. The self-driving hardware team works in an R&D lab in Pittsburgh. Born into a wealthy family in Iran, Khosrowshahi fled the country with his parents and two brothers in 1978 during the Iranian revolution. His family settled in Westchester County, New York. After graduating from Brown University, he worked as an analyst at the private bank Allen & Company and then landed at Barry Diller’s internet holding company, InterActiveCorp. That’s where he made his name. In 2002, just after the September 11 terrorist attacks, IAC bought a controlling stake in Expedia. Travel in the US had ground to a halt, but Diller thought it would come back, and it did. Expedia spun off from IAC in 2005, with Khosrowshahi at the helm. When we talked in January, Khosrowshahi admitted that he was only just diving into Uber’s product strategy. He’d been too busy initially dealing with the company’s many emergencies: the Waymo trial; London’s ban on Uber drivers. And he’d had to resolve the fallout from a hack of data from 57 million customer and driver accounts that Uber had failed to disclose for more than a year. In January, Uber shareholders agreed to sell $8 billion worth of stock to a group of investors led by Softbank. The deal also eliminated the super-voting stock rights that gave some board members, including Kalanick, heightened decision­making control. And a few weeks later, the company settled its lawsuit with Waymo, paying between $163 million and $245 million in company shares, depending on how you count Uber’s worth, to Waymo. With those issues wrapped up, Khosrowshahi was ready to focus on his idea of quality. In February his deputies appeared at an all-hands meeting to sell the company’s 18,000 employees on the importance of one metric: the ratio of driver or rider complaints to rides booked. That ratio needs to be reduced—a lot—in 2018, he told them. (He won’t specify the company’s 2018 target, but he said, completely deadpan, “Zero is zero.” Note: Even the Pershing didn’t have zero defects.) He believes the ratio is a good metric to use because it can be improved only if operations, technology, and customer service work together. “It’s a unifier,” he said. At Expedia, he worked on reducing a similar complaint metric, and the experience cemented his belief: As the measure improved, so did sales. No one I talked to described Khosrowshahi as charismatic. I watched him at an all-hands meeting in January where he took the stage for less than five minutes to introduce speakers, then stood along the wall with colleagues, arms crossed, apparently listening. His message—“driving quality is just as important as driving new features,” as he told me—offers a steady reassurance, but his deliberate pace has made some people uncomfortable. Among the product teams, in particular, there’s still some question about his acuity. Though he has a degree in electrical engineering, he’s a business guy. One former executive told me that there were many people “carefully watching whether Dara can step into and excel in the role of product leader and visionary.” One current employee, who largely approves of the new leadership, said he also misses the adrenaline rush that came with working under Kalanick. At Khosrowshahi’s Uber, people go home for dinner. Then there are employees and alumni who believe the worst aspects of the culture Kalanick created can’t be so easily uprooted. “In everything from the way performance reviews were geared to the way bonuses were distributed, people were incentivized to backstab and undercut each other constantly,” says one longtime employee who left recently. “They were incentivized to be assholes.” That’s not something that changes in six months, even with new performance review metrics, new leadership, and an emphasis on getting things right the first time. Already, some people have moved on. Aaron Schildkrout, who started Carbon’s development, resigned in December. He’s now in New Zealand, meditating. In February, Graf announced he was leaving too. Replacing Graf turned into a bit of a blunder. The company rescinded an offer it made to a former Amazon executive to fill Graf’s product chief role after discovering the guy wasn’t working for Amazon when Uber hired him. He’d left in 2017. This is the type of information you’d expect a company to know before extending an offer for a crucial executive position. Nor has Kalanick completely disappeared. He no longer has super-voting rights, but he does still sit on the board. The relationship between the two men, Khosrowshahi told CNBC in January, is “fine, but strained.” (Kalanick declined to be interviewed.) For most of last year, Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving cars were under scrutiny while the company faced allegations it had stolen Waymo’s technology. I spoke to the head of the unit, Eric Meyhofer, early one February morning as he was preparing for the trial in the case1. He said that the distraction of the suit had slowed his team down. “It’s like pulling an anchor along,” he said. Settling that case should have provided some relief. But then came the fatal accident in March. After the Tempe police released a dashcam video of the woman being hit by an Uber Volvo, several academics suggested the self-driving technology should have prevented the accident. The human operator in the car, whose role is to step in when the tech fails, didn’t stop the crash either. The incident suggested deeper problems. The New York Times reported that Uber’s self-driving cars were having trouble with basic maneuvers, like operating next to big rigs, and its safety drivers had to intervene far more often than those of competing autonomous car projects. Then Reuters reported that Uber’s Volvos lacked enough sensors and so had a blind zone. (An Uber spokesperson said, “Safety is our primary concern” in developing self-driving technology.) In late March, Arizona governor Doug Ducey demanded that Uber suspend its road tests in the state indefinitely for its “unquestionable failure to comply” with the duty to prioritize public safety. The accident and Uber’s conduct was becoming a political issue as well as a corporate one. The company had intended to offer driverless cars within 18 months, but with testing suspended, that’s unlikely. When I talked to Khosrowshahi in January, he had not yet visited the Phoenix self-­driving operation or the autonomous group in Pittsburgh (he would make his first trip there in March). As with other, less-urgent issues, he hadn’t gotten there. But he had been thinking about the particular challenge of testing a software product that powers a large object made of heavy metal traveling at high speeds in spaces populated with humans. “In software, the edge cases are a bug, and you follow a bug and you fix it,” he told me. “In autonomous, the edge cases are accidents that risk human lives.” The Tempe accident was just the sort of edge case he had hoped to avoid. The kind of problem that no one can fix after the fact. Jessi Hempel (@jessiwrites) is a senior writer for WIRED. This article appears in the May issue.

"Trump says he’s writing a $10M check to his campaign. With Election Day less than two weeks away, Donald Trump says he’s writing a check for at least $10 million to his campaign to close the cash gap with Hillary Clinton. Trump told Fox News’ Bret Baier on Friday that he’d be contributing another $10 million  —   possibly more. The   infusion comes as newly released records show Trump has given his presidential campaign a total of $56. 1 million  —   but just $31, 000 in the first 19 days of October. The filings also show a nearly    cash advantage for Clinton. Trump has $16 million left in his own campaign kitty and $68 million when joint fundraising committees are included. The Clinton campaign, by contrast, has $62 million on hand  —   and $153 million with joint fundraising committees. Trump raised $29 million in the first   of October, while Clinton hauled in over $57 million, records show. Both campaigns spent at roughly the same clip this month : $49. 3 million from Trump, $50. 1 million from Clinton. Large chunks of Trump’s spending went to ads  —   with $19 million to a TV ad buyer and $14 million to digital consultants. The campaign spent $332, 511 on expenses paid directly to Trump properties. Clinton spent almost the same amount on TV and digital ads  —   $33 million. Clinton also has the super PAC advantage, with Priorities USA, the main group supporting the Democratic nominee, saying it raised $175 million. Priorities has $15 million cash on hand. In a sign of confidence that Clinton will win the presidency, it’s even begun to use some of its resources to help   House candidates. Trump super PACs haven’t even raised $65 million,  Also of note, on the day the recording surfaced with Trump bragging that he groped and kissed women whenever he wanted because he’s a “star,” his campaign raised at least $11. 5 million.",1.0
"Bernie Sanders’s accusation that Clinton is running a ""money laundering scheme,"" explained.  Bernie Sanders is still running for the Democratic nomination. And his campaign still has some attacks on Hillary Clinton.    Early this week, after a Politico report examined the workings of Clinton’s fundraising apparatus, Sanders’s campaign accused Clinton of running a ”  scheme.” At issue is Clinton’s ”joint fundraising committee”  —   an organization set up to help Clinton raise money with the Democratic National Committee and 32 separate state Democratic parties. Clinton has said the money for the committee would also be used to help fund Democrats’ state parties. But Politico reported on Monday that the state parties have gotten less than 1 percent of the total cash raised, and that it’s instead being sent to the DNC and Clinton’s presidential campaign.               This may not sound like such a big deal. After all, don’t most Democrats think keeping the White House should be the party’s top priority?    The problem, according to campaign finance experts, isn’t necessarily the final result but how they got there: by giving the superrich one more back door to avoid campaign spending limits. What is a ”joint fundraising committee,” and how is it supposed to work? At their most basic level, the joint committees exist as a way for separate political organizations to come together to maximize their ability to raise money from donors. Rather than each try to hit up the same individuals separately, the organizations form an umbrella group  —   here called the Hillary Victory Fund  —   to which donors can give directly.    Under the current law, the most an individual donor can give to a presidential campaign committee is $2, 700 per election. An individual donor can also give up to $33, 400 to the DNC, and up to $10, 000 to each state party committee.            By existing as a group, the ”joint committee” can get a big fat check that would be far too large for it to legally receive if its members were fundraising alone, according to Bob Biersack, a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. So a single donor could give around $353, 000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, on the principle that money would go to the presidential committee, the DNC, and 32 state parties. ”They say, ‘We’re going to raise money collectively, and split it up according to the specific limits for each of us,’” says Biersack, who worked for three decades at the US Federal Election Commission. ”And it’s very efficient for the donors: You just write one check, and you’ve given to everyone involved.”    The group then divvies up the donations, Biersack says, and everyone walks away happy. At least in theory. What happened with Clinton’s ”joint fundraising committee” Clinton’s ”joint committee” has three major parts  —   her presidential campaign committee, the Democratic National Committee, and 32 different Democratic state party committees from around the country. At first, it appeared that all three had a great deal of mutual interest: Clinton would bring her   donors to the table, giving groups like the Democratic Party of Utah access to George Clooney’s wallet that it would never otherwise get. In exchange, Clinton could broaden her fundraising pitch by saying  —   as she did on several occasions  —   that she was raising money not just for herself but for the benefit of the entire Democratic Party.             And this is how we get to the current controversy. While Clinton’s ”joint fundraising committee” was marketed as a way to help all three groups involved, Politico’s reporting showed that 99 percent of the money raised by the committee has ended up going to the DNC or to Clinton’s campaign directly. At first, $3. 8 million was sent to the state parties in line with the campaign finance laws, according to Politico. But rather than use that cash for their own operations, the state officials just sent 88 percent of it back to the DNC  —   apparently out of pressure from national headquarters. That’s left many of the state officials feeling that they were getting a raw deal, according to Politico’s reporting.    ”It’s a   benefit,” one state party official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Politico. ”Everyone who entered into these agreements was doing it because they were asked to, not because there are immediately clear benefits.” The Clinton campaign has pushed back at that report, telling CNN that $9 million of the Hillary Victory Fund’s $46 million would later be transferred to state parties for   races. But it’s not clear when that will happen.            If the state parties were getting screwed by the arrangement, why did they agree to play ball? It turns out that Clinton loyalists control many of the state party operations, and, moreover, many of the committees have no real bargaining power to fight back against the national command, according to Biersack. ”What are the state parties going to do?” Biersack said. ”The DNC will help in a battleground state. But if a place like North Dakota doesn’t play along, the DNC might not send staff and resources for other races.” How Clinton’s committee exploited a loophole in campaign finance law As a matter of law, there’s nothing illegal going on here: State parties are allowed to transfer as much money as they want back to national headquarters, with essentially  no limitations. Here’s the problem: Campaign finance rules exist to put a cap on how much one person can spend on a presidential campaign. If that money really does go to the state committees, then there’s no issue.     But if the vast majority of that money is essentially funneled to the national campaign anyway, the original restriction on giving to national committees appears pretty meaningless. ”It’s a circumvention of the contribution limits on the national party,” says Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute. ”The victim here is anybody who thinks there’s anything meaningful left to contribution limits.” Why campaign finance experts think this is such a problem I interviewed three of the country’s top campaign finance experts for this story, and they all said that Clinton appeared to be exploiting a loophole in election law to render restrictions on contributions essentially meaningless. ”Collusion is a nasty word, but if every dollar you give to the state parties ends up going to the DNC, it just puts a lie to the idea that there’s a $33, 000 limit on what you can give to the DNC,” Biersack said.            And that feeds the real danger here: that by opening the door for this kind of backdoor maneuvering, the superrich are going to have much greater sway over the political process. ”If you’re raising $150, 000 from one person, what’s the cost? What are those people going to expect in return? What are they going to get in return?” Biersack says.    This dynamic, Malbin and Biersack said, is even more dangerous now after a 2014 Supreme Court decision,  McCutcheon v. FEC, stretched this loophole much further. Before the ruling, an individual could only donate to about a dozen different state parties once every two years. The Supreme Court’s decision tossed out that restriction, giving donors the ability to donate $10, 000 to all 50 states every year. ”This was always possible, up to a point,” Biersack says, ”but this year it’s so much bigger because of the McCutcheon decision.” Clinton’s defense: This is still ultimately money for the party It’s easy to see why Sanders’s team pounced on Politico’s reporting: It appears to show that Clinton is stretching election law to maximize the amount of money her campaign apparatus can get from the super wealthy. But there are some important defenses of the campaign’s actions here, too, and it’s important to understand why her team may have opted for the structure of the joint fundraising committee. For one, it’s not as if the money from the state parties is being directed back for personal use by Clinton. It’s not: It’s instead going back to the DNC, which would presumably support whomever the nominee ends up being.               ”If Bernie Sanders were in a different position and leading the race, he’d be poised to take advantage of this huge war chest that’s been amassed at the DNC,” says Josh Stewart, deputy communications director at the Sunlight Foundation, a watchdog group for money in politics. ”If Sanders had won, this money would be his  —   and a lot would be from the Clinton machine that helped raise it.” Then there’s the fact that the DNC is going to be using the money in a way that they at least say will benefit the state parties in meaningful ways. Politico reports that much of the cash directed back to the DNC will go toward ”enhancing national voter data, and research and communications efforts”  —   efforts that will redound to the states’ benefit. ”There’s no conceivable way each state would have the capacity to build the database that’s being built here,” Malbin says. ”It takes a lot of money and technical knowledge to do it, and the states don’t have that.” And while some state party committee members told Politico that they felt like they were being unfairly treated, others  —   like Jeremy Kennedy, the executive director of the Maine Democratic State Committee  —   said they were happy with the arrangement.  One of the defenses here is that if the DNC uses the money running general election ads, that will ultimately help the state parties for which the money was intended. ”If the DNC runs attacks on Donald Trump and on Republican senators, how is that not helping every Democrat on the ballot in every specific state?” Stewart says. Are Democrats able to reform a corrupt system if they participate in it? The fight over the fundraising committee is about a pretty specific question: whether it’s above board for the state parties to funnel money back to the DNC.    But there’s a deeper divide over the role of money in politics between the two candidates that may have made this argument unavoidable. A series of Supreme Court decisions over the past few years have opened the floodgates for unprecedented spending on presidential elections  —   through Super PACs,   and other forms of outside spending groups. Clinton has been clear about the need to get big money out of politics, calling for a return of public financing of campaigns and a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. Sanders sees the joint fundraising committee as evidence that Clinton isn’t being honest about her commitment to reform. As with Clinton’s speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, Sanders thinks taking money from the superrich is incompatible with the promise to get them to stop pouring cash into politics. ”You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next,” Jeff Weaver, a Sanders aide, said in a statement. But to Clinton, this attack may ignore the reality of the world as it is. Sure, it would be ideal if nobody had to raise money for elections. But is Clinton really to blame for working within the system as it exists? ”None of these loopholes she’s using were created because of anything Hillary Clinton did,” Stewart says. ”And I think Clinton has made it no secret that she and her allies, including the party, will use every tool at their disposal to compete in the general election.”     ",-1.0
"Being named Jon Snow in real life is not all fun and direwolves. Jon Snow is the name on everyone’s lips after the   “ ” character came back from being “ ” on the hit HBO show. Given that the character’s name isn’t as ubiquitous as, say, Tyrion Lannister or Theon Greyjoy, for example, it’s inevitable that a few   Jon Snows are out there, hearing the same jokes over and over. The Post caught up with a few of these noble warriors to see how life away from The Wall has been treating them. One such is Jon Snow, 45, of Charlottesville, Va. (we’ll call him Jon Snow 1) a car salesman who claims that his name tag alone is an instant icebreaker with customers. “It’s been just a true blessing for the kind of business I’m in,” he says. “Anytime somebody makes a reference to my name, I can instantly build a rapport [by saying] ‘We’re south of the Wall right now’ or something along those lines, and pretense would drop, and it’s all about ‘Hey, what’s going on.’   …     I’ve had people actually say, ‘I had to go buy a car from Jon Snow. ’” Jon Snow 1 says he’s even considered pitching a cheekily themed commercial for his business due to all the hubbub, but ultimately decided it might be “a little too corny,” and besides, he hasn’t had any trouble reaping the rewards of his name recognition thus far. But, as with the fictional version, for these   counterparts, it’s not always fun to be Jon Snow. Jon Snow 1, for example, had to stop wearing his name tag outside the workplace  —   it’s common in his business for salesmen to wear their tags out and about in case they might strike the interest of a potential client  —   because it was “getting unfun” to have random conversations struck up in public at inopportune times, like when he went on a   Target run to buy supplies for his    and fellow customers would pull him aside to chat about the character apropos of nothing but his shared title. Name tag: banished. ‘I even had a Domino’s order canceled because they thought it was a prank.’  Jon Snow, 26, of Manapalan, N. J. (Jon Snow 3) says that as a   of the series  —   he gave up on the watch a few episodes into Season 1 (a blasphemy that the Sparrows would have a field day over, no doubt)  —   he finds the constant comparisons rather irritating, overall. “I’ve had emails to customer service reps ignored and then followed up and found out they thought it was a prank,” he says. “I even had a Domino’s order canceled because they thought it was a prank. ” “People assume that because my name is Jon Snow, I must watch the show, and maybe it would be easier if I did because then I might understand their jokes,” Jon Snow 3 says. And jokes there are aplenty, from the canonical “Winter is coming” and “You know nothing” (which was even written on Jon Snow 1’s cup at Starbucks a few days ago) to the outright bizarre  —   “People even told me I died,” says Jon Snow 3  —   since the punniness is built right in. Despite their shared nomenclature, these actual Jon Snows aren’t quite sure what makes the recently resurrected Lord Commander such an idol among the “Thrones” faithful. Jon Snow 1 speculates that “you have to have a hero” and that to see this “whipping boy of all the privileged ones probably turn out to be the heir apparent all along” will be satisfactory indeed, but as for why he  to survive a la the Red Witch channeling the Lord of Light where so many of his relatives have not   …     it’s unclear. And as for why the mere name relation is such a spark of interest, well, it’s just sheer dumb luck, Jon Snows everywhere agree. Jon Snow 3, who doesn’t always understand or appreciate the fan fervor, admits that “at least Jon Snow is a   character. It’s not all that bad to be indirectly famous. ” Jon Snow 2, for one, is “just glad my name wasn’t Joffrey. ”",1.0

"To understand the Women’s March on Washington, you need to understand intersectional feminism.  The day after inauguration, tens of thousands of people  —   maybe more  —    led by a group of four women, are marching in Washington, DC. and around the country. Their goal, although they’re not officially pitching it as such, is to send a message about women’s rights that will provide a counterbalance to the political and personal values espoused by incoming President Donald J. Trump.    And by ”women’s rights,” organizers have taken care to make it clear that they mean all women of all backgrounds: The official platform the Women’s March on Washington places the demonstration in the context of not only suffragists and abolitionists but the civil right movement, the American Indian movement, and Black Lives Matter. Just two paragraphs into the   document, they note that ”women have intersecting identities and are therefore impacted by a multitude of social justice and human rights issues.” Examples of this, including the especially urgent need for equal pay among women of color and the way they’re uniquely victimized by the criminal justice system, follow in the rest of the platform. Sounds reasonable, right? But it’s that idea of ”intersecting identities” that’s been at the core of criticism of the march, both by   participants and by conservative critics.    The New York Times reported that some white women opted out of the march because they felt uneasy, excluded, or attacked by discussions in the Facebook group about what organizers said was a deliberate decision to highlight the unique issues faced by women who are also members of racial minority groups or immigrants.    National Review characterized that dynamic in a dramatic headline, ”Women’s March Morphs Into Intersectional Torture Chamber,” calling the idea of intersectionality itself ”a cliché” that ”sounds like one of the reasons we got Donald Trump.” These reactions reflect an ongoing debate about intersectional feminism  —   the idea that many women are members of other marginalized groups, which affects their experiences  —   that is bigger than the march. The issue has especially heated up since social media has democratized and made public conversations about issues affecting women.    Critics of the concept often seem to conflate the principle itself with the personal and emotional fallouts that can occur when nonwhite women jump into the debate and push for feminist activists and organizations to include their perspectives. Other popular   arguments may sound familiar: that it promotes victimhood, that it causes infighting, or that it’s no more than an invention of    whiny people on college campuses. That’s because they’re the very same criticisms that could be made, and have been made, about feminism itself  —   or   or any other push for equality. In each of these contexts, the pushback tends to come from those who’ve been included all along and think efforts to include others aren’t worth the messiness and fuss. Intersectionality: a big, controversial word with a simple,     meaning Although intersectionality can be used as a framework for understanding any combination of experiences, you’ll most often hear it in the context of feminism, and that’s obviously why it’s being discussed and debated around the women’s march. Here, it means paying attention to the ways the   discrimination and oppression a woman may experience can be compounded by her race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and more.    ”Intersectionality simply means that there are lots of different parts to our womanhood,” Brittney Cooper, an assistant professor of women’s and gender studies and Africana studies at Rutgers University, explained. ”And those parts  —   race, gender, sexuality, and religion, and ability  —   are not incidental or auxiliary. They matter politically.” Lehigh University’s Monica Miller defined it in an unpublished 2014 interview with Vox: ”An intersectional feminist approach understands that categories of identity and difference cannot be separated and doesn’t abandon one category of analysis such as gender, or sexuality in favor of (over) analyzing others such as race, and class.” When the word ”intersectionality” has been used in the media recently, it’s often been to explain things like why some white women in social media conversations about feminism have been ”asked to check their privilege”  —   a demand that many see as unfair and aggravating. But the concept is much more than a trump card in Twitter battles  —   it has deep intellectual roots and   consequences. If you think this started with the Women’s March, or with Twitter battles over ”check your privilege,” think back a few decades Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor at both UCLA and Columbia, is credited with coining the term intersectionality. She did this in her 1989 paper ”Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics.” In that article, she talked about the way black women were excluded from both mainstream   theory and feminist theory. She made clear that this exclusion couldn’t be remedied ”simply by including Black women in an already established analytical structure.” Because the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, she said, ”any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated.” In other words, explaining black women’s experience was not something that would happen by simply remembering to include them in discussions on racism and sexism. That’s because where these two types of discrimination intersected in their lives, it created something else altogether that deserved its own attention.    To understand how Crenshaw came up with this, remember she was on the legal team representing Anita Hill when she testified that then —  Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her in the past. Crenshaw has said Hill’s experience and public reception to the hearings crystallized the complications of race and gender for her. In an August 2014 interview with the New Statesman, she recalled that many African Americans supported Thomas, agreeing that he was the victim of a ”  lynching,” while many white feminists took up for Hill but saw her as ”a colorless woman,” not acknowledging the way being black was part of her experience. It frustrated Crenshaw. ”We as   women feminists were trying to say, ‘You cannot talk about this just in gender terms  —   you have to be intersectional  —   there is a long history you cannot ignore,’ but they didn’t have the skills to be able to talk about it,” she said. Crenshaw also pointed out that she came up with intersectionality to address a specific legal problem: As she put it, ”To capture the applicability of black feminism to   law.” An example she frequently cites in explaining the need for intersectionality is the 1976 case Degraffenreid v. General Motors, in which five black women sued General Motors for both race and gender discrimination. The law was inadequate to address this, Crenshaw said, explaining, ”The particular challenge in the law was one that was grounded in the fact that   law looks at race and gender separately.” The consequence, she said, is that ”when   women or any other women of color experience either compound or overlapping discrimination, the law initially just was not there to come to their defense.” Intersectionality, she said, was a way of addressing the court’s blind spot. In a recent article on the racial dynamics of the women’s march, the New York Times wrote, ”This brand of feminism  —   frequently referred to as ”intersectionality”  —   asks white women to acknowledge that they have had it easier.” But while that may be a side effect, intersectionality has a much longer history and a bigger purpose than getting people to admit things.    Crenshaw, who has made it clear that she popularized the term ”intersectionality” but not the concept, wrote, ”In every generation and in every intellectual sphere and in every political moment, there have been   women who have articulated the need to think and talk about race through a lens that looks at gender, or think and talk about feminism through a lens that looks at race.” We hear about intersectionality mostly when someone forgets to think about it The word ”Intersectionality” itself isn’t important  —   but the concept behind it is. Without it, there’s no way to talk about the experience of people who belong to more than one oppressed group. At its most simple, in the feminist context, it means recognizing that not all women are white, and some LGBTQ people and people of color are women. That’s not controversial, really  —   it’s just reality. This helps explain why it mostly comes up in public debates when it’s missing, and when this missing analysis means some people (normally women of color) have been ignored. This is similar to the way we often hear about feminist critiques in response to examples of misogyny flares up or when efforts to make things equal for women fall short. To give a couple of examples: Patricia Arquette and Madonna each made statements about women’s rights in recent years that seemed to put women and people of color in separate categories. Their remarks provided examples of the very opposite of intersectionality. In her acceptance speech for winning Best Supporting Actress during the 2015 Academy Awards, Patricia Arquette had this to say about feminism:  It’s time for women. Equal means equal. The truth is the older women get, the less money they make. The highest percentage of children living in poverty are in   households. It’s inexcusable that we go around the world and we talk about equal rights for women in other countries and we don’t . .. have equal rights for women in America and we don’t because when they wrote the Constitution, they didn’t intend it for women. One of those superior court justices said two years ago in a law speech at a university that we don’t have equal rights for women in America and we don’t because when they wrote the Constitution, they didn’t intend it for women. So the truth is even though we sort of feel like we have equal rights in America right under the surface there are huge issues at play that really do affect women. It’s time for all the women in America, and all the men that love women and all the gay people and all the people of color that we’ve all fought for to fight for us now.     Well, this started off okay. But wait a minute, what was that about gay people and people of color whom women have fought for, fighting for them? That makes it seem like these groups don’t include women. Plus, as Slate’s Amanda Marcotte pointed out in response to the comments, the very issue of wage inequality is affected by race as much as gender:  The American Association of University Women analyzed census data on the wage gap and found that although white women make 78 cents to a white man’s dollar in the United States, black women make a mere 64 cents, and Latina women make a paltry 54 cents. Similarly, being gay or transgender often means taking a hit in income. The Center for American Progress finds that   couples raising children make about 20 percent less than straight couples in the same situation. Transgender people have a poverty rate that is four times that of the general population. It is definitely not time for ”all the gay people” and ”all the people of color” to set aside their own battle for equality in order to fight for straight, white women now.  Not to mention this also seems to imply that the women who have been doing the fighting all along didn’t include women of color and queer women. But that’s what happens when you don’t remember that many people often belong to more than one group. It didn’t make a lot of sense, and when observers said it ignored intersectionality, that’s what they were referring to. But then, providing another example of what not do to, Madonna made a similar statement in a March 2014 interview with Out magazine:  ”Gay rights are way more advanced than women’s rights. People are a lot more   to the gay community than they are to women, period.” For women, she feels, the situation has hardly improved since 1983. ”It’s moved along for the gay community, for the   community, but women are still just trading on their ass. To me, the last great frontier is women.”     Again, this is confusing and seems to represent a world in which there aren’t gay women, or black women, or feminists who are black and gay. She’s asserting the only women are white and straight, which is the opposite of intersectionality. There are endless pop culture and political debates that are easier to talk about if we remember that people have multiple, intersecting identities that color their experiences and our reactions to them. Miller said understanding criticisms of Beyoncé as being too sexy to be ”properly” feminist, politically contested dialogues around the   of the ”Black Lives Matter” discourse, and disproportionate levels of white American sympathy over the Charlie Hebdo tragedy compared with outrage over the actions of Boko Haram’s kidnapping and abuse of a group of girls, are all examples of issues that require us to consider the ways different categories of identity work together. Some people worry that by pushing for feminist analysis to include race, sexuality, class, and other identities, people who push for intersectionality are spreading feminism so thin that it will be useless. But that’s not the case. The problem with this thinking, as Jarune Uwujaren and Jamie Utt, writing for Everyday Feminism, pointed out, is ”a     feminist movement that focuses only on the common ground between women is erasing rather than inclusive. Even if all women deal with sexism, not all women deal with racialized sexism, or transmisogyny, or cissexism.” Some of the angst over the term is about the concept itself; even more is about the tone of social media conversations about it Christina H. Sommers, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and host of the video blog The Factual Feminist, has a YouTube video centered on her view that intersectionality is no more than ”a conspiracy theory that leads to tribalism and bullying.” In it, she enumerates what she sees as the consequences of intersectional analysis in feminist groups and organizations: victimization, creation of new reasons for anger, bullying of white men, and new divisions rather than unity. These are, ironically, some of the same things that critics say about feminism itself: that it encourages women to think of themselves as weak and causes unnecessary, silly conflict. Cooper says the   arguments like Sommers’s are familiar. ”Some of this is willful ignorance. Surely folks know that it’s racism that is divisive, not those who call out racism,” she said. ”But there is also a desire for an easy narrative of unity, and easy unity isn’t unity at all. That’s why it falls apart so quickly.”    Cooper’s ”easy unity isn’t unity at all” point shed light, for example, on some reactions to the Pantsuit Nation Facebook group that now has more than 3 million members. That online community, formed to harness feminist excitement around Hillary Clinton’s presidential run, flourished after her loss with personal testimonies about girl power, inclusiveness, and good deeds. It succeeded in being an online sanctuary and source of inspiration for many, and inspired enough material for a book proposal. But as Erin Gloria Ryan reported for the Daily Beast, when women of color in the group noted their discomfort with what they saw as the ” ” tone of the posts primarily by white women, they said they were ”ignored or shouted down for interfering with the humming positivity machine.” Even more common than criticisms of intersectionality like Sommers’s are those that conflate the concept of intersectionality itself with the discomfort experienced by some of the people who find themselves confronted with it on social media. Writing for the Nation in 2014, Michelle Goldberg reported on what she characterized as ”  about alleged racial insensitivity” and explained her assessment that online, ”intersectionality is overwhelmingly about chastisement and rooting out individual sin.” The piece, ”Toxic Twitter Wars,” was all about the internet. This is a theme. It’s no surprise that National Review’s and New York Times’s pieces on the debate about intersectionality around the women’s march based their reporting in one place: the event’s Facebook page. Social media means, unlike in the   days when Crenshaw coined ”intersectionality,” nonwhite women can weigh in, in real time, about how the principle is  —   and isn’t  —   being integrated into feminist work. This isn’t always easy to hear. As a result, many critiques of intersectionality itself are mixed up with the critiques of the tenor and tone of the online discussion about it, and the feelings that accompany those debates. But nothing new is really happening except that new platforms allow nonwhite women to interact with their white counterparts in easily accessible and public ways that they haven’t until now. When it comes to the women’s march and feminism overall, working this out is worth the potential hurt feelings Upset and discomfort are predictable parts of debates about intersectionality, says Cooper, who explained, ”No one wants to feel like a bad person. Finding out that you might be harming people simply because you have been oblivious to them and their needs is a hard truth to confront.”    But hurt feelings and discomfort, primarily experienced online, that come with making sure efforts like the march represent all women are worth it, according to the organizers. ”This was an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep places,” said Linda Sarsour, a Muslim who heads the Arab American Association of New York and one of four   of the national march, told the New York Times. ”Sometimes you are going to upset people.” ”If your   goal is to get as many people as possible at the march, maybe you don’t want to alienate people,” Anne Valk, the author of Radical Sisters, said in the same article. ”But if your   goal is to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change, then that has to include thinking about race and class privilege.” Cooper says a key point to remember amid debates about intersectionality is simply that ”when we organize under the banner of shared womanhood, acknowledging all these moving parts makes our collective work not weaker but stronger.” ",-1.0
"Hollywood says it’ll be better about casting trans actors. Drunk History went ahead and did it..  Comedy Central’s Drunk History is an unabashedly ridiculous show. Comedians get trashed and narrate hilarious, if not totally accurate, versions of historical stories; then the series enlists actors to   their way through the narrator’s giddy slurring.    It’s a whole lot of fun, but this week’s episode was also quietly revolutionary in the simplest of ways: It cast transgender actresses to play transgender roles. For its ”Bar Fights” episode, which aired October 11, Drunk History hired Crissle West  —   the comedian responsible for the show’s previous and spectacular Harriet Tubman segment  —   to monologue about the Stonewall Riots and pivotal transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson. Johnson was played by transgender actress Alexandra Grey, whom you might recognize from the season three premiere of Amazon’s Transparent.    Related Drunk History’s   tells us about storytelling and getting   Miranda drunk at his parents’ house    West is a very funny comedian, but what makes her Stonewall retelling so great is her obvious passion for the story she’s telling.  She’s so spirited and emotional that she can barely contain herself. (And, okay, sometimes she doesn’t; don’t forget, she’s super drunk.)    Grey brings West’s fiery words to life with a light in her eyes, especially when joined onscreen by fellow trans (and Transparent) actress Trace Lysette as trans activist Sylvia Rivera. The combination is incredibly compelling, and it’s easy to understand why.    Historically, transgender characters  —   whether they’re fictional or based on   figures  —   have rarely been played by transgender actors, with many defaulting to casting cisgender men as transgender women instead of bothering to look any further for trans talent.  Drunk History’s casting of trans actors in trans roles is a positive, active step toward showing others that it isn’t actually that hard if you care enough to look for trans talent in the first place.    But just as importantly, the   ”Bar Fights” also recognizes Johnson and Rivera for their crucial role in the Stonewall Riots and ensuing movements within the LGBTQ community  —   a sadly rare feat. (See: Roland Emmerich’s Stonewall, which rewrote the story to let a fictional cisgender white gay guy throw the legendary first bottle that sparked the riots, when it was actually Johnson.) Watching trans actors step into the roles of underappreciated trans activists is downright inspiring, even  —   or maybe especially  —   when paired with West’s insistent ramblings, which only get more and more fervent as she reaches the conclusion of this iconic story:  The people at Stonewall that night realized, ”There’s a community of us. It’s not just 20 of us on fuckin’ Wednesday night when it’s half off. There’s a whole group of us who are here in this gay shit, and you’re not gonna erase us from the motherfucking conversation no more.”     The segment is a forceful (and even funny!) reminder of how hard LGBTQ people have fought for their rights. And as Grey and Lysette smile defiantly into the camera at the end, these two trans women playing two legendary   trans figures is a reminder of the progress that’s been made  —   and how far we still have to go. Drunk History airs Tuesdays at 10:30 pm on Comedy Central. The first three seasons are currently available to stream on Hulu. ",-1.0
"Meet the Sulfur Miners Risking Their Lives Inside a Volcano. To celebrate his wife’s birthday last year, Canadian photographer Larry Louie took her to a sulfur mine. That wasn’t the plan—their original itinerary was in Bali. But after a couple of days in that tourist-plagued paradise, they began looking for something a little less commercialized. A bit of online research led Louie to the sulfur mines of the dormant Mt. Ijen on the nearby island of Java. Famous for their electric-blue fire (created by the spontaneous combustion of subterranean gasses) and toxic yellow smoke, the mines would make an interesting photography project, Louie thought. His wife agreed, so the couple packed their bags, booked a flight to Java, and hired a local guide to take them to the sulfur mine. They started climbing Mt. Ijen in the middle of the night and reached the summit just before dawn in order to see the blue flames. As the sun rose, they descended into the vast volcanic caldera, which emits billowing clouds of sulfur from hundreds of cracks in the earth. Ceramic pipes placed by miners in the caldera floor direct some of the smoke toward collection points, where the superheated gas instantly turns into a solid, forming dripping yellow stalactites. These stalactites are what the workers mine. Using picks, they chip off chunks of sulfur, place them in reed baskets, and carry them up to the top of the crater, where they are loaded into wheelbarrows for the trip down the mountain. (Sulfur is used in cosmetics, explosives, and agricultural products.) Louie learned from his guide that workers spend 12-hour shifts dodging plumes of poisonous smoke (with many protected only by rags tied around their mouths) while carrying up to 180 pounds of sulfur on their backs. With temperatures reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a pervasive smell of rotten eggs, it’s one of the most dangerous and unpleasant jobs on earth—but pays $12 a day, a relatively high salary for that part of Indonesia. Louie’s guide provided him and his wife with gas masks, but they were too clogged to be useful. This became a problem when Louie insisted on getting as close as possible to his subjects. After three hours of shooting, he nearly passed out from all the toxic smoke. “I got a little dizzy and was losing my eyesight a little bit,” he says. “Fortunately my wife saw me and she yelled to the guide to get me out of there.” They eventually made the decision to end the expedition early and descend the mountain. Louie had hoped to return the next day to shoot more photographs, but felt too sick to make another climb. Louie has photographed people working in some of the world’s most extreme environments, including a Bangledeshi garbage dump, an Indian jute mill, and a Moroccan tannery. But few workers labor under conditions as difficult as the sulfur miners on Mt. Ijen. “I’ve always been interested in highlighting the strength of people and the struggles of workers around the world,” he says. He’d like to return to Mt. Ijen someday—but this time, perhaps, with a functioning gas mask. Images from the series “Devil’s Gold” are included in Louie’s book Beyond the Darkness, which was shortlisted for the 2019 Lucie Photo Book Prize.",0.0

"Stealing a Plane Isn't Easy. How Did It Happen in Seattle?. Seattleites got a serious scare on Friday evening when an airport employee stole a large turboprop airplane owned by the Alaska Air Group from the area’s Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and took it for an unauthorized flight. The incident ended when the empty 76-seater Q400 Bombardier airplane crashed on a small island 25 miles to the south of the airport, killing the unsanctioned pilot—but only after an hour of confusion in Seattle, as flights were grounded, air traffic control tried to persuade the man to land the plane, and F-15 fighter jets scrambled out of nearby Portland, Oregon. No other injuries have been reported.

"Indicted Utah sect leader Lyle Jeffs slips away from FBI — most likely using olive oil.        The leader of a polygamous Utah sect came up with a simple but slippery way to escape law enforcement late last month: olive oil. Lyle Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (also known as FLDS) was initially being held in jail after federal authorities arrested him and 10 other church leaders over a    case earlier this year. Despite pleas from federal prosecutors and estranged family members who warned that Jeffs would escape, U. S. District Court Judge Ted Stewart ultimately decided to release him in early June because his trial was delayed. Stewart would come to regret his decision less than two weeks later when Jeffs escaped.    [Federal food stamp fraud charges could topple Warren Jeffs’s polygamous Utah sect]   The FLDS church, which splintered off more than 70 years ago from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, is known widely for its polygamy and came under national scrutiny when the church’s   “prophet,” Lyle Jeffs’s brother Warren Jeffs, was sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for raping a child. Its legal troubles didn’t end there. Church leaders have also been previously accused of harsh   conditions and more recently of running a $12 million    and   scheme. Members live in remote areas of Utah and Arizona and are highly secretive and distrustful of the government. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described the FLDS as a “white supremacist, homophobic,   totalitarian cult. ” In his sermons, Warren Jeffs has declared homosexuality “the worst evil act you can do, next to murder,” and has implored women to “build up young husbands by being submissive. ” Stewart had set strict conditions on Jeffs’s pretrial release. He was confined to his Salt Lake County home with few exceptions, told he couldn’t contact various people affiliated with the sect, and made to wear a GPS monitoring device. The polygamous leader nevertheless managed to escape federal authorities and has yet to be found.  “He used a substance which may have been olive oil to lubricate the GPS tracking band and slip it off his ankle,” FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Barnhart told Fox 13. Investigators believe that Jeffs removed his ankle bracelet at some point on June 18, local media reported, because federal agents were in contact with him earlier that day but lost contact during the evening hours. After speaking with Jeffs’s neighbors, investigators told the Salt Lake Tribune that witnesses saw “a newer model dark [Ford] Mustang” leave his garage sometime during the night. The next day, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest. Jeffs’s rather surprising method of escape raised eyebrows and could make some wonder whether it’s actually that easy to slip off an ankle monitor. Investigators told local media that Jeffs managed to escape without setting off any alerts because he didn’t damage the monitor as he was taking it off. “It wasn’t enough to actually sever the   connection,” Sandra Yi Barker, a spokeswoman for the FBI’s Salt Lake City Division, told local media. Others aren’t that surprised that Jeffs escaped. According to the Daily Beast, Warren Jeffs was also on the run for months in 2006 before police found him in Las Vegas, where they caught him riding in an Escalade filled with disguises such as wigs and sunglasses. Former FLDS members suspect that Jeffs is holed up in one of his many hiding spots, according to media reports. “He’s got people that will buy him a house in a heartbeat,” Matt Jeffs, one of Lyle’s sons, told the Salt Lake Tribune. Known as “the house of hiding network,” which was created around 2004 by Warren Jeffs, it includes houses around the country in states such as Idaho, Nevada and Texas.",-0.5
"François Fillon, the right-wing hard-liner who just won a major French election, explained.  A   politician, written off by pollsters and establishment pundits for month, rockets to the top of the polls in his party’s presidential primary. He vows to “conquer Islamic totalitarianism,” promises to clamp down on mass immigration, and calls for a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. When the vote is finally held, he trounces his establishment rivals, setting him up for a   general election victory.    No, he’s not Donald Trump: He’s François Fillon, the man who won a vote Sunday to lead France’s   Republican Party in the 2017 presidential election. Fillon, seen as an irrelevant long shot when he announced his candidacy in April 2015, beat the more centrist Alain Juppé by a wild   margin. Fillon’s landslide win sets up a showdown with Marine Le Pen, leader of the   xenophobic Front National (FN) party. On key issues like immigration, it isn’t much of a choice: Fillon has basically aped her xenophobic agenda. “There’s not that much difference between Le Pen and Fillon on Islam, security, [immigration] and foreign policy,” Art Goldhammer, a senior affiliate at Harvard’s Center for European Studies, tells me.    It also makes France the third major power, after Britain and the United States, to experience a shock election result fueled in major part by grievances over culture and ethnoracial identity. Fillon’s campaign stole themes that had been developed by Le Pen’s     FN, and married them to a kind of   and socially conservative sentiment that proved surprisingly widespread among the French middle class.    Now, anything could happen in 2017, but Fillon is the favorite: Almost all polls show the Republicans leading both the FN and the   Socialists. His victory would augur major changes for France: a historic slashing of its generous welfare state, a crackdown on immigration, restrictions on gay couples’ rights as parents, and tension between France and its NATO allies as the nation cozies up to Putin’s Russia on issues like Ukraine and Syria. Fillon’s victory, in other words, represents the mainstreaming of a   platform in yet another of the world’s nuclear powers.    Who is François Fillon, and what does he want?             Despite the similarities between elements of Fillon and Trump’s messages, the two men could not be more different in terms of background and temperament. Fillon grew up in the northwestern city of Le Mans, in an    Catholic family  —   his father was a bureaucrat and his mother a history professor. He has been in politics for practically his entire adult life, winning a seat in France’s parliament in 1981, when he was a mere 27 years old. (He was, at the time, the youngest member of the National Assembly, France’s lower legislature.) When he took office, Fillon was a member of Rally for the Republic (RPR)  —   a   party committed to an ideology pioneered by former French President Charles de Gaulle.    Gaullism, as it’s called, is a kind of nationalism that has dominated the French right in the postwar era. It emphasizes the need for social cohesion, a powerful central government, and a strong, independent foreign policy  —   making it skeptical of both the European Union and the United States’ role in continental affairs. Fillon’s particular brand of Gaullism, called “social Gaullism,” focused on the threat to French sovereignty from European integration. It also emphasized the need for the government to care for the excluded in order to maintain the overall health of the nation. That meant a relatively interventionist economic policy aimed at, among other things, providing jobs for the jobless and homes for the homeless. Fillon’s sincerely held Catholicism added another element to this  —   in 1982, he voted against a bill that would decriminalize   relations. These ideas, as the BBC’s Hugh Schofield documents, dominated Fillon’s long career in   politics. He served in the cabinet five times, and as prime minister from 2007 to 2012. (In the French system, the prime minister generally plays second fiddle, helping to implement priorities set by the president.) His premiership was not successful, with few legislative accomplishments he can take credit for. According to the New York Times,   Nicolas Sarkozy would make fun of Fillon behind his back. After leaving the premiership, Fillon took a hard turn to the right. It’s not exactly clear what changed his mind  —   whether it was a need to reinvent himself after a failed stint as prime minister or an actual change of heart. Regardless, Fillon became one of the premier critics of the French welfare state, arguing for a need to slash 500, 000 civil service jobs and cut spending by $116 billion in five years. He criticized France’s famous   workweek, arguing that French workers were too reliant on the government, and argued for tax cuts to relieve the burden on the middle class. This is a wholesale rejection of France’s postwar model  —   a kind of   turn akin to what Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher promised their respective countries in the 1980s. Both the French and British press frequently compare Fillon to Thatcher.      Fillon also took a hard line against multiculturalism. He wrote a book called Conquering Islamic Totalitarianism, and said France needed to work with Putin to defeat ISIS in Syria. He supported the movement to ban “burkinis,” swimwear marketed to Muslim women who want to cover up at the beach. He promises to impose quotas on immigration that vary by region of the world and write immigration restrictionism into France’s constitution. This put him basically in the same place as FN leader Le Pen, whose political identity and appeal centers on   opposition to immigration and multiculturalism. Fillon’s social conservatism extends beyond these issues, going back to his Catholic roots. Fillon expresses personal opposition to abortion and   marriage, though he has said he will not attempt to reverse French law in either area (both are legal). He does want to scale back gay couples’ rights, proposing a new legal definition of “parenthood” that would prevent   parents from officially adopting children. Finally, he has proposed a fairly drastic revision to French foreign policy. He is an actual personal friend of Vladimir Putin; the two have, among other things, played billiards together. Unsurprisingly, his foreign policy is astonishingly   and not just on issues related to terrorism. He has called on the West to accommodate Putin’s interventionism in Ukraine, and blamed “American imperialism” for Europe’s problems. “Putin has praised Fillon’s leadership, from the time he was prime minister,” Goldhammer explains. “Every sign is that Fillon will be as close to Putin, if not closer, than Trump promises to be. ” Fillon, then, has put together a set of policies that push the boundary of France’s political discourse in every area. He’s essentially doubled down on social Gaullism’s nationalism and jettisoned its   economics in favor of a conservatism more recognizable to American audiences. By French standards, he’s a radical  —   a stance covered up by his establishmentarian past and relatively quiet manner.    Why Fillon won the primary  —   and why he’s favored in the general            For most of the election, very few people gave Fillon a chance. Juppé, the widely popular moderate, and former Fillon frenemy Sarkozy were the favorites in the primary, with polls between them narrowing as the campaign went on. But in early November, polls started to show a surge in support for Fillon. On November 20, the Republicans held a first round of voting  —   and Fillon and Juppé were the top   eliminating Sarkozy from contention. Sunday’s vote was a runoff between the two finalists, and Fillon ran away with it. According to Goldhammer, Fillon did three main things right. First, he stole   themes about the threat from Muslim immigration, picking up on widespread discontent among   voters with mass immigration from Muslim countries. This sentiment is powerful enough to essentially singlehandedly fuel the rise of the FN, so tapping into it was a smart play for a conservative candidate. Second, his   history and   stance made him into the candidate of France’s vocal minority of Catholic conservatives. The kind of people who participated in the mass protests against   marriage in 2013, a response to President François Hollande’s successful bid to legalize it, were the kind of people likely to vote for Fillon. Third, and perhaps most surprising, he identified a level of hostility to the French welfare state among the middle class that very few analysts had picked up on.    His promise to cut civil service jobs “was an appeal to the provincial bourgeoisie, which turned out very heavily for him,” Goldhammer says. “Since nobody saw it coming, it’s only in retrospect that I can give you this argument . .. but it seems that within a fairly substantial segment of the French right, the idea that the French state is extraordinarily bloated and needs to be cut down in size has gained increasingly in popularity. ” This combination made Fillon uniquely positioned to beat his primary opponents. Juppé’s economic platform was essentially   but Juppé failed to embrace Fillon’s cultural conservatism in the same manner. Sarkozy leaned perhaps even more heavily into   politics than Fillon did, but didn’t promise to cut the size of government as dramatically. Only Fillon’s complete conservatism captured the mood of the Republican electorate. And now that Fillon has won the Republican primary, it’s not clear who can stop him. The French left is in shambles. Socialist President Hollande’s approval rating is hovering around 4 percent, but he has yet to rule out running for another term. His prime minister, Manuel Valls, is more popular, but he’s facing a challenge from Emmanuel Macron, a charismatic   and former economy minister who’s running as an independent. Polls suggest that the Socialist candidate, Macron, and another centrist (François Bayrou) split the center and left votes, weakening all of them. It’s possible this won’t happen, and the left will reassert itself in the face of Fillon’s   conservatism and Le Pen’s xenophobia. But the most likely result of 2017’s first round of voting is a runoff vote between the two rightists, with the Gaullist battling it out against the upstart xenophobe. Current polling shows a massive Fillon lead over Le Pen in a    contest, roughly on par with the amount by which he beat Juppé. The most likely outcome is that he maintains a lead, owing to the FN’s toxic reputation with mainstream voters.    But his win is by no means inevitable. “Whether Fillon wins [in a head to head] becomes an   proposition, regardless of the poll that came out today that shows him winning two to one against Le Pen,” Goldhammer says. “I don’t think that’s going to last. ” Economics are the key dividing issue. Le Pen embraces an approach that scholars call “welfare chauvinism,” a defense of the French welfare state as something only French people should enjoy. This means dramatically slashing immigration but also preserving the key institutions of the French welfare state (like high levels of state employment). Right now, the anti —  Le Pen sentiment depends on the perception that she’s an   extremist and borderline racist. This, Goldhammer suggests, can only last so long as centrist and   voters avoid taking a hard look at Fillon’s platform.  Once people fully understand that there isn’t much difference between him and Le Pen on immigration and multiculturalism, they may well choose to vote for her to save the welfare state. “He’s going to need votes from the left and the center,” Goldhammer says. “If he sticks with his   platform . .. I don’t see what the attraction is there. ” Fillon’s victory, then, makes a veer to the right in France very likely. It’s just not clear which version of hard right politics will win out.     ",-1.0
"Verizon mulling acquisition of big cable company. Verizon Chief Executive Lowell McAdam may be getting ready to answer rival AT&T’s moves to buy DirecTV and Time Warner. The New York wireless giant is weighing the acquisition of a cable company to help grow demand for its wireless data products, two   sources told The Post. The CEO told friends at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month that he wants to buy into cable, one source said. “They need it for 5G,” said a second source, confirming McAdam’s interest. The most likely targets would be “Charter or Comcast,” the source noted. “Altice is too small,” the source speculated. To be sure, Verizon is not in talks with any cable company and may not ever make such a move. Still, McAdam has been under pressure recently with Verizon’s   months after two major hacks of the internet portal were revealed. The wireless giants operate on 4G wireless networks but are preparing to become a real alternative to the cable company with phone, TV and data services. To do that more effectively, the phone companies are pouring money into 5G connections that can work with cable systems to provide more stable coverage for consumers. McAdam has already given Wall Street analysts and investors big hints that he’s looking at a combination with, say, a Charter Communications. In a   meeting with Wall Street analysts, McAdam said a   between the two “makes industrial sense. ” Three weeks later, at CES, his comments to friends make it clear that cable distribution is a path he is exploring, perhaps more seriously than first thought. Verizon is still yet to say whether it is moving ahead with  . Were Verizon to make a move on Liberty   Charter, it would replicate the kind of deal shareholder John Malone made back in 1998 to sell global cable company TCI Communications to AT&T. Rival AT&T not only owns DirecTV but also has an agreement to acquire Time Warner for $109 billion in cash and stock. McAdam is obsessed with distribution, said a person familiar with his thinking. Verizon in April sold most of its FiOS network to Frontier Communications, clearing the path, some believe, to allow a cable merger. “For regulatory reasons, Verizon can’t dominate in FiOS and cable, so it appears to have to set its sights on cable,” an industry source said. Charter could be a seller under the right conditions, the source added, emphasizing that Malone and Charter CEO Tom Rutledge are just getting going on their vision for Charter. But it does mean Verizon has to promise enough autonomy for the Charter team to advance its own plans  —   only if “Malone and Rutledge are not ready to cash out,” the source said. Verizon declined to comment.",1.0
"A feminist war is being waged at Broadway’s ‘Waitress’. There’s been a little distaff   at “Waitress,” the new musical slated to open on Broadway in the spring. The show’s been touting its   creative team as a selling point  —   Sara Bareilles (score) Jessie Nelson (book) Diane Paulus (director) Jessie Mueller (star) and Barry Weissler (producer). Just kidding, Barry! But his wife Fran’s name is above the title. The creators of “Waitress” make the point in interviews that this is the first musical in Broadway history created solely by women. (It’s based on the 2007 film, written and directed by the late Adrienne Shelly.) The other day, the ladies posed for a big spread in the March issue of Vanity Fair. But something went wrong at the end of the photo shoot. Sources say the women, led by Paulus, felt they came off as a little too girlie, a little too silly, especially since they see “Waitress” as a feminist statement. They grumbled about the shoot, which sources say led to the removal of the show’s press agent, Jim Byk. A   veteran in the p. r. trenches, Byk was none too pleased. He bolted from his agency,    where he worked for nearly 15 years. He starts his new gig with Philip Rinaldi next week. BBB’s Jackie Green has taken over for the show, further increasing its gal power. Byk couldn’t be reached for comment; Boneau   declined to comment. How stridently feminist “Waitress” should be has caused some tension between the creators and the investors. With Paulus at the helm, the show, especially in the first act, focuses (relentlessly to some tastes) on the issue of wife beating. “Waitress” tells the story of a woman who makes desserts for a diner in a drab small town. She’s trapped in a loveless marriage to a bully of a husband. He beats her up in the movie  —   and in the show. Production sources say Paulus, a Very Serious Artist, sees the show as a statement against wife beating. As a result, the first act is “very dark,” says a source, which jars with what is, at heart, an optimistic show about female empowerment: The waitress breaks free of her husband by starting her own   company. The producers and the investors think “Waitress” should be a   show for women, who buy the majority of tickets on Broadway. They want it to be uplifting the way “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and “The Color Purple” are. But Paulus, sources say, is trying to give it a harder, political edge. The husband comes off as so brutal, the audience recoils, sources say. “Diane’s a feminist and kind of political,” says a source. “She doesn’t want to do a peppy, happy musical. ” Paulus, who directed the   “Finding Neverland,” wasn’t available for comment Thursday. I know the Weisslers well, and have great respect for their producing abilities. They have, after all, made “Chicago” into one of the   and most lucrative shows in Broadway history. They know the audience, and if they think there’s too much emphasis on domestic violence in “Waitress,” Paulus and her band of feminists should heed their advice. “Waitress,” which has some terrific songs, by the way, has a real shot at being a commercial winner this year. Let’s leave domestic violence to Tennessee Williams and David Mamet. A new block of tickets to “Hamilton” went on sale this week and theatergoers  —   and brokers  —   snapped them up despite an astounding average price of $420. But the fact is, that’s a bargain: If you want to see “Hamilton,” you’ll pay upwards of $1, 500 to sellers like StubHub.",1.0
"Health care is now set to be a defining issue in the next election cycles.  With one hasty and excruciatingly narrow vote, House Republicans have all but guaranteed that health care will be one of the most pivotal issues shaping the next two election cycles  —   including congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative races in the 2018 midterms and President Trump’s likely reelection bid in 2020. Just as Democrats were forced to defend Obamacare in the 2010 midterms  —   the result was a    drubbing that President Barack Obama called a “shellacking”  —   Republicans this time will be in the hot seat. GOP members of Congress will be asked to defend their votes for a bill that could strip insurance from 24 million Americans and jack up premiums and deductibles for the country’s sickest and oldest citizens. Governors, gubernatorial candidates and state legislators, meanwhile, will be asked whether they intend to “opt out” of provisions in the Affordable Care Act that are overwhelmingly popular with voters, as is permitted under the Republican plan. Their plans for state Medicaid programs also will be scrutinized if massive GOP cuts to Medicaid funding are realized. “Health care will be a defining issue,” said John Del Cecato, a Democratic strategist. “It’s hard to say if it will be the only issue between now and 2018, but I can’t recall a vote this significant in terms of its political potential in 20 years. ”   House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) and 216 of his GOP colleagues voted yes for the American Health Care Act on Thursday. (Melina   Washington Post)  For example, Tom Perriello (D) whose 2010 vote for the Affordable Care Act helped cost him his seat in the House, is now making his support for Obamacare a centerpiece of his pitch to become governor of Virginia  —   depicting the Republican   plan in his latest ad as an ambulance being crushed at a junk yard. A picture of Rep. Mimi Walters ( .) taking a selfie at Trump’s Thursday Rose Garden celebration to cheer House passage of the GOP bill quickly made its way into a fundraising appeal from one of her Democratic challengers, Kia Hamadanchy  —   with the subject line, “I am appalled. ” And when 217 Republicans cast “aye” votes for the GOP plan on the House floor on Thursday afternoon, their Democratic colleagues bid them a rowdy adieu by singing, “Na na na na, na na na na, hey, hey, hey, goodbye. ”  [House Republicans claim a major victory with passage of   overhaul]  “Health care is a riptide,” said Mark Putnam, a Democratic media strategist. “It has now jumped from being just a federal issue to being a state issue because states are given the right to opt out of protections for preexisting conditions. Legislators and governors will have to answer for that. ” Trump’s political advisers calculated that it was less damaging electorally for congressional Republicans to pass a bill that some of their constituents see as deeply flawed than to have passed nothing at all. “I think it’s a lot worse to have said for six years, since 2010, that this is something you were going to do and then when you had the chance to do it, you didn’t,” said Marc Short, the White House’s director of legislative affairs and a veteran party strategist.       (Jenny   Washington Post)   Short said Thursday’s vote will help endear Republican House members to the conservative base as well as to Trump. “I think those members who stood with the president, the president will remember that and their voters will remember that,” he said. In remarks at the Rose Garden event, Trump said the current law had been “a catastrophe” and made sweeping assurances about the GOP’s replacement measure, which he said he was confident would pass the Senate despite some strong reservations from Republican senators. “Yes, premiums will be coming down,” Trump said. “Yes, deductibles will be coming down. But very importantly, it’s a great plan. And ultimately, that’s what it’s all about. ”  [Trump crows about his health care victory  —   even though he hasn’t really won yet]  Health care already has reverberated in some special elections this spring, including in the race for the congressional seat in Georgia that was vacated by Tom Price when he became Trump’s secretary of health and human services. On Friday, the Cook Political Report, which evaluates the political environment in all 435 congressional districts, shifted its assessments in 20 House races in favor of the Democrats  —   some from solidly Republican to likely Republican, others from likely Republican to leaning Republican, and more still from leaning Republican to  . Thursday’s vote “guarantees Democrats will have at least one major    vote to exploit in the next elections,” wrote David Wasserman, the report’s House editor. He added that the new dynamic “is consistent with past scenarios that have generated a midterm wave” and “almost a mirror image of 2010. ” Polling shows that the public disagrees with Republican   plans.   percent of Americans support repealing and replacing the law known as Obamacare, while 61 percent want to keep it and try to improve it, according to a Washington   News survey in April. A Quinnipiac University survey in March found that American voters overwhelmingly disapproved of an earlier version of the House   plan by 56 percent to 17 percent.  [Public pans Republicans’ latest approach to replacing Affordable Care Act]  The latest version of the American Health Care Act was passed in the House on Thursday by a vote of 217 to 213 without an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, which would determine its cost and impact on insurance coverage. The bill would shift power to states to set some health insurance rules, slash Medicaid spending by more than $800 billion and cut nearly $600 billion in taxes under the   law, most of which will benefit the wealthiest Americans. Obama’s Affordable Care Act also prohibited insurers from charging more to customers with preexisting medical problems  —   one of its more popular provisions  —   but the Republican bill would lift that prohibition and give states the option to let insurers charge more for them. Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who completed focus groups in Ohio on Thursday evening that briefly touched on this topic, concluded that there was “considerable confusion over what was in the legislation. ” “The GOP would have likely faced a backlash from its base had they not passed ” he said. “There is a clear sense that both Trump and Republicans had promised as much. ” Newhouse added that the Democrats in his focus groups “seemed to be in a mood to punish those who supported the AHCA” and were “more energized and focused” than the Republicans. Away from the White House, there was a palpable sense of doom among some GOP campaign operatives, who imagined how easy it would be for Democratic challengers to launch potent attacks about health care. Even many House Republicans who voted for the bill are already distancing themselves from it, arguing that problems would be solved in the Senate. “What we’ve done here is political malpractice,” said Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist who is sharply critical of Trump. “Democrats will run ads with weeping parents who can’t cover their premiums and Little Johnny dying. . . . Or ‘Congressman Smith voted to end coverage of preexisting conditions. That means 875 people here in X district who have cancer cannot be covered. ’” Wilson added, “Republicans in the House right now should be on their knees praying for the Senate to kill this,” arguing that the line of attack would be less powerful if the bill does not become law.  [How the House got a   bill after Trump and Ryan stepped back]  Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic operative who has advised scores of House candidates, said, “It doesn’t take even a good   to figure out how to tell the story of the damage that this bill does to people’s health care, whether it’s the AARP saying it charges people over 50 five times more, or the American Cancer Society saying it guts protections for preexisting conditions. There’s no real way to defend that to voters. ” Democratic leaders are trying to seize the political advantage and use the issue of health care to galvanize a liberal base that was demoralized by Trump’s election. They are reporting a surge in new Democratic candidates looking to run in next year’s midterms, even in districts and states considered solidly Republican. Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( .) the House minority leader who lost her speakership after the 2010 midterms and has been plotting her return to the majority ever since, declared Thursday that Republican House members had “walked the plank” with their support for the American Health Care Act. “This vote will be tattooed to them,” Pelosi said. “They will glow in the dark. ” Of course, Democrats also risk being too bullish. “I love going into a campaign where the opposition is blindly overconfident,” said Chris LaCivita, a Republican strategist. “I think they’re just going to put all their eggs in one basket. ”  Ashley Parker contributed to this report.

"Aleppo evacuation efforts falter as Islamist fighters burn convoy of rescue buses.   BEIRUT  —   Evacuation efforts in Syria were on the verge of fresh collapse Sunday, with thousands of people trapped inside the shattered rebel enclave of Aleppo after gunmen burned a rescue convoy bound for government areas in a neighboring province.  The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said evacuations were postponed for an “unknown” period, deepening abject suffering inside eastern Aleppo as the United Nations thrashed out ways to resolve the crisis. After more than three hours of closed consultations, France and Russia said Sunday that they had agreed on a U. N. Security Council resolution to deploy international monitors to eastern Aleppo to ensure safe evacuations and immediate delivery of humanitarian aid. Negotiations to revive a complicated exit deal for civilians and fighters in Aleppo have broken down repeatedly since forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar   forced the rebels’ effective surrender there last week, amid abuses by government and rebel loyalists along the evacuation routes. And Sunday, hours after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was hopeful that evacuations could resume, a fresh hurdle emerged: Video footage from the northwestern province of Idlib showed smoke and fire billowing from a convoy of repurposed school buses bound for Fouaa and Kefraya, Shiite villages besieged by rebels that have taken on great symbolic importance for Syrian President Bashar   and his Iranian backers. Islamist fighters had set fire to the buses, which were sent to evacuate hundreds of wounded people from those   villages. Iran, a Shiite power, had demanded that the area be evacuated as part of the broader deal allowing thousands of people to leave what remains of the   eastern areas of Aleppo.  “You pigs are here to help Shiites. You won’t leave alive,” a man is heard saying off camera in one of the video clips. Although the identity of the attackers is not clear, reports suggest that they had the backing of Jabhat Fatah   an    Sunni group with significant influence in Idlib.  “Cowardly terrorist attack on civilian buses & killing driver must not end evacuations,” Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser to the United Nations, said Sunday in a tweet. In another video, the militants appeared on camera, chanting that the attack had restored the “dignity of Aleppo’s besieged people. ” But inside the rebel enclave in Aleppo, desperate residents said it only brought more misery, with thousands awaiting evacuation in freezing temperatures as night fell. The enclave has been reduced to a pinprick of territory after government forces swept in earlier this month, backed by heavy bombing raids.   The compromise struck Sunday between Russia, an Assad ally that is helping him with troops and weapons, and France offers hope to the beleaguered residents of eastern Aleppo, many of whom are wary of leaving the area unless international observers monitor the evacuations. On Friday, a bus carrying hundreds of evacuees was held up by   militia fighters who were later accused of ordering dozens of people off the bus and then stripping, robbing and reportedly killing several in the group.  “Tell me, what do we do, what choices do we have?” said Ahmed   an engineer in eastern Aleppo. “If we leave, we risk death or humiliation in front of the people we love. But if we stay here? That is death, too. ” The United Nations also accused Syrian government troops and a Shiite militia from Iraq last week of carrying out    executions as they swept through the area. Samantha Power, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters Sunday that there had been “many, many reports of people being pulled off buses and disappeared, whether into conscription or into torture chambers or killed outright. ” After earlier disagreements, France and Russia said Sunday that they had agreed to the text of a draft Security Council resolution that would allow about 100 U. N. observers to deploy quickly to the area. A vote was expected Monday. François Delattre, France’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the resolution, if formally approved, could prevent “mass atrocities. ”  The announcement followed a statement last week from   Ayrault, France’s foreign minister, who decried the situation in Syria as “an affront to the human conscience. ”  “There is, now more than ever, an urgent need to put an end to the hostilities in Aleppo,” Ayrault said. “The regime’s supporters, starting with Russia, cannot let this happen and accept a strategy based on revenge and systematic terror without running the risk of becoming accomplices to the crimes. ” When rebels seized eastern Aleppo from the government in 2012, they had hoped to create a seat of power to rival the Syrian capital, Damascus. Four years on, Aleppo’s recapture by government forces has accelerated the demise of the armed opposition, which will now be boxed inside Idlib without any strategic urban centers under its control.

"Beadle-Schefter ESPN infighting breaks out over Hardy interview. ESPN served as the platform for Greg Hardy’s   apology  —   and not all of its employees are thrilled with the decision. Following his interview with the disgraced defensive end Tuesday, analyst Adam Schefter   that he believed Hardy to be a changed man after serving a   suspension for allegedly assaulting   Nicole Holder in 2014. “I went in there with the idea that everybody had, that this guy’s a monster, OK? I went in there thinking that this is one of the scariest people in the NFL. And I came out there with a very different feeling about him,” Schefter said. Fellow ESPN personality Michelle Beadle didn’t agree with Schefter’s opinion. For the love of f&$@. Dude doesn’t admit to wrongdoing. Dude has changed? I give the hell up.  —   Michelle Beadle (@MichelleDBeadle)  Hardy, who called himself an “innocent man” during the exchange, also questioned the authenticity of   last November of Holder’s bruises. The Ravens’ Steve Smith   and Beadle blasted the network for providing him an outlet. “I feel dirty in that this guy has no job right now, and for some reason we’ve decided as a network that we’re going to give him the stage for his redemption tour as he basically goes out and tries to find some employment,” Beadle said on her own ESPN show, “SportsNation. ” “I don’t understand why we’re doing that. If he wants to figure out a way to get his message out there  —   which by the way, he hasn’t said he did anything wrong, so how a man is supposed to convince anybody he’s changed and yet not admit to actually doing anything? I have no idea. But why we’re giving him the forum to go out there and tell anybody, that is where I’m a little bit confused. ” This isn’t the first time Beadle has taken aim at ESPN. After Ray Rice received a   suspension for knocking out   Janay Palmer in an Atlantic City elevator two years ago, she expressed disgust over colleague Stephen A. Smith’s comments suggesting women are sometimes responsible for domestic violence incidents. “Violence isn’t the victim’s issue. It’s the abuser’s. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting,”  . “I was in an abusive relationship once. I’m aware that men & women can both be the abuser. To spread a message that we not ‘provoke’ is wrong,”  .",1.0
"Watch: Hillary Clinton’s open, heartfelt response on God and prayer.  Responding to a question about God and religion at the CNN Democratic debate on Sunday, Hillary Clinton gave a thoughtful answer on how prayer factors into her daily life.    A woman named Denise, whose church services Clinton has apparently visited, asked Clinton to whom, and for whom, she prays. ”I have said many times that I am a praying person, and if I hadn’t been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one,” Clinton said, to chuckles from the crowd. She added that she prays for people in authority who have to deal with the pressures of leadership.    ”I try to think about what they’re going through even when I disagree with them,” Clinton said. ”Trying to find some common ground, some common understanding that perhaps can make me more empathetic. I don’t always succeed. I will tell you that.” She said she prays ”on a pretty regular basis during the day, because I need that strength and I need that support.” She closed by discussing the importance of ”humility” when you’re asking people to give you one of the most important jobs in the world.    Clinton has spoken before on the campaign trail about the importance of ”love and kindness.” Ruby Cramer explored how this idea relates to Clinton’s Methodist faith and her frequent image problems in the media in a profile at BuzzFeed News earlier this year.

"Italy’s Emma Morano, the world’s oldest person, dies at 117.  ROME  —   Emma Morano, at 117 the world’s oldest person who is also believed to have been the last surviving person born in the 1800s, died Saturday at her home in northern Italy, her physician said. Dr. Carlo Bava told The Associated Press by phone that Morano’s caretaker had called him to say she had stopped breathing in the afternoon while sitting in an armchair at her home in Verbania, a town on Italy’s Lake Maggiore. Bava said he had last seen his patient on Friday when “she thanked me and held my hand,” as she did every time he called on her. While Morano had been increasingly spending more time sleeping and less time speaking in recent weeks, she had still eaten her daily raw egg and biscuits that day, he said. A woman in Jamaica, Violet Brown, who was born in that Caribbean island on March 10, 1900, is now considered the oldest known person in the world, according to a list kept by the Gerontology Research Group. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness tweeted his congratulations to her. Morano’s doctor, who lives a few blocks away from his patient, had been her physician for nearly a quarter of a century. Morano, born on Nov. 29, 1899, had been living in a tidy,   apartment, where she was kept company by her caregiver and two elderly nieces.  “She didn’t suffer. I’m happy she didn’t suffer but passed away that way, tranquilly,” Bava said Saturday. He said she had been her usual chatterbox self until a few weeks ago. Since then it was clear, “she was slowly fading away,” and spending nearly all day in bed, Bava said. Last fall on her birthday, Morano declared: “I’m happy I have turned 117!” Bava has previously told the AP that Morano lost a son to crib death when he was six months old. Morano left her husband in 1938 because he would beat her. She “abandoned the husband in the Fascist era, when women were supposed to be very submissive,” Bava said in a 2015 interview. “She was always very decisive. ” Morano began working in a factory making jute bags when she was 16. Then she worked at a hotel, working way beyond the usual retirement age. Beside work, she enjoyed herself. She was considered a good dancer with a beautiful singing voice in her youth. She also defied health advice, Bava said Saturday. Some doctors had warned her against eating three eggs daily, which she did for years, but she ignored their advice. Researchers from Harvard Medical School visited her in 2014 as part of a study into immunity to diseases, the Italian news agency ANSA said. ___ Frances D’Emilio is on twitter at www. twitter. .

"Antonin Scalia’s death makes the 2016 presidential election a referendum on the Supreme Court.  Justice Antonin Scalia’s death clarifies the unusual importance of the 2016 election. President Obama took office with only one justice aged 80 or older. The next president will likely take office with two, plus an existing vacancy.    Obviously, every presidential election is enormously important. Without Barack Obama winning in 2008, Obamacare wouldn’t have passed, and the EPA likely wouldn’t have taken action on climate change. If Al Gore had taken office in 2001, the US almost certainly wouldn’t have invaded Iraq. But some elections prove more important than others  —   and one of the factors that decides the   effect of a presidency is the number of Supreme Court Justices they choose. It’s impossible to know for sure how many Supreme Court vacancies a given president will get, but the lower bound is usually zero. In 2016, the lower bound is not zero. It is one. It appears that Senate Republicans are preparing to take a position of total obstruction to any nominees President Obama might put forward:      McConnell pic. twitter.   —   E   (@EvanMcSan) February 13, 2016    And what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says goes. If he doesn’t want there to be a vote on Obama’s nominee, there won’t be a vote on Obama’s nominee. And even if he allows a vote, there’s still a filibuster for the Supreme Court, unlike for lower courts. That means that Obama needs 60 votes to confirm his pick  —   and I highly doubt there are 14 Republicans willing to trade the Court’s most reliable conservative vote for even a relatively moderate liberal.    That means that the Republicans will probably get their wish, and the choice will fall to the next president. And in all likelihood, not just that choice. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 82 years old, has struggled with both colon and pancreatic cancer, and received a stent in her right coronary artery following heart trouble. Anthony Kennedy is 79, and also has a stent. Stephen Breyer is a relatively spry 77, but if the next president gets reelected will be 85 by the time their tenure is over. The likely range for the next president is thus between one and four justices. If Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is elected and have a Democratic Senate, they will be able to replace Scalia and possibly Kennedy with solidly liberal justices, ushering in a totally new era of Supreme Court jurisprudence that could see decisions like Citizens United overturned. If Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, or Ben Carson get elected, they will not only keep Scalia’s seat in conservative hands, they will likely be able to replace Ginsburg and possibly Breyer too, moving the Roberts court even further to the right.    What a Democratic or Republican victory means for the court             The stakes for the Court aren’t always this obviously huge. When Obama was elected, it was pretty obvious he’d get to replace John Paul Stevens, who was already 88. But Ginsburg was only 75, Kennedy and Scalia only 72, Breyer only 70, and David Souter only 69. It was very possible that Obama could’ve replaced Stevens and no one else. But the stakes of this election for the court are clear, and enormous. A Supreme Court with six solid liberals  —   Democrats’   scenario  —   could overturn Citizens United, overrule Heller (which established for the first time that the Second Amendment gives individuals a right to bear arms) and enable school desegregation plans the Roberts Court struck down. It could conceivably, depending on its exact composition, abolish the death penalty for good, maybe even solitary confinement too. And a Supreme Court with seven solid conservatives  —   Republicans’   scenario  —   could overturn Roe v. Wade, strike down even more campaign finance regulation, and narrow or abolish Miranda rights (as Scalia and Thomas once tried to do). If justices with a libertarian bent get appointed, you could even see a partial return of the Lochner era, with minimum wage statutes and worker protections getting struck down as violating ”liberty of contract.” That Supreme Court would almost certainly have invalidated Obamacare.    These are very very high stakes indeed. And they matter not just for the presidential election, but for highly contested Senate elections in states like Wisconsin, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Florida. A vote for Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire becomes a vote for the conservative vision of the court. A vote for her Democratic rival Gov. Maggie Hassan becomes a vote for the liberal vision. Reasonable people can disagree about the propriety of Senate Republicans punting the Scalia vacancy to the next president. But the fact that they’ve done so makes this election a referendum on the Supreme Court. Do you want a Court that allows governments to crack down on money in politics and guns and that limits the power of police and prosecutors? Or do you want a court that empowers law enforcement, paves the way for states to ban abortion outright, and limits the federal government’s Commerce Clause powers to regulate the economy? Usually these are treated as questions for the nine justices. But they are also questions for every American voter  —   and this year more than most. ",-1.0
"What the Obamas’ $65 million book advance actually means.  Barack and Michelle Obama each just sold a book in a joint deal that appears to be bigger than any previous presidential book deal in history. Reportedly, they are making $65 million, which is an unprecedented amount of money for a presidential memoir.     It’s a move that signals the publishing industry’s faith in the enduring value of a book from the Obamas  —   and the belief that if Barack Obama’s memoir is good enough, it might become a genuine American classic.  The Obamas are reportedly earning more than $65 million in this deal. That’s way more than the Clintons got. Penguin Random House, which bought the two books, won’t discuss the numbers, but the Financial Times reports that the bidding for world rights surpassed $65 million. That number well exceeds the industry’s   expectations about the Obamas’ literary earning power: This January, literary agents and publishers predicted to Forbes that Barack Obama’s memoirs might go for as much as $20 million, and a combined   book deal might net as much as $45 million.  For comparison, trade publication Publishers Lunch reports that Bill Clinton secured a $15 million advance for his 2004 memoir My Life (a   advance at the time, and roughly $21 million in 2017 dollars) while Hillary Clinton got an advance of $11. 5 million for her most recent memoir, 2014’s Hard Choices. That adds up to $36. 5 million, just over half of the Obamas’ advance  —   or $42. 5 million when adjusted for inflation, so about   of the Obamas’ advance.    For Penguin Random House, which published My Life, and Simon & Schuster, which published Hard Choices, those high advances paid off. The Clintons both rapidly earned out (which I’ll explain below). But that’s not always the case.     Book advances are investments. They don’t always offer a good return for the publisher When publishers buy a book from an author, they aren’t offering them   money. They’re predicting how much money the book might accrue in royalties, and they’re offering the author an advance payment of those royalties in a single lump sum. For the book to “earn out,” as the Clintons’ books did, it has to sell so many copies that its royalties surpass the amount of the advance. It’s only after the book has earned out that the author starts to receive royalties on top of their advance.  Every publisher uses its own formula to calculate the magic number at which point a book will earn out. And the numbers depend on proprietary information, so I can’t tell you what Penguin Random House’s acquisition formulas look like. But here’s a very rough, extremely simplified idea of how a publisher calculates how much to pay an author and still make money.    Imagine you’re an acquiring editor who wants to publish a new book. Based on the sales history of other, similar books, you feel confident that you can sell 10, 000 copies of the new book. You figure you can set the price at $20, and you’re offering the author royalties of 10 percent of the book’s list price, so the author will receive $2 for every book sold.  That means it’s safe for you to offer the author an advance of $20, 000 when you acquire the book. The author receives that money upfront, and nothing else until the book has sold more than 10, 000 copies, at which point the author has “earned out. ” The remaining $18 for every book sold are split between the publisher and the distributors to cover their own costs and contribute to their profit margin. For the Obamas to earn out their $65 million advance, they will most likely need to sell at least several million copies all together. And in an industry where selling 100, 000 copies of a title is enough to make it a respectable bestseller, that’s not chump change. For comparison’s sake, the    book of 2014 sold 573, 000 copies.     Theoretically, the advance doesn’t change how much money the author gets, it just changes when they get it. But in practice, it’s not uncommon for books to fail to earn out. Sometimes, publishers overestimate how a book will sell, or they decide that an author’s prestige value is so high that it’s worth keeping them around with a super high advance regardless of the potential earnings involved.  (Literary agents sometimes try to encourage that way of thinking. Andrew Wylie, an agent so ruthless he’s known as “The Jackal,” is credited with the possibly apocryphal comment, “If my client’s book earns out, I haven’t done my job. ”)  A really good Obama book has the potential to become a genuine classic So we don’t know for sure that Penguin Random House really thinks the Obamas will earn out a $65 million advance  —   but it’s also a safe bet that the publisher is unlikely to have spent quite so much money if it didn’t expect to make at least a lot of it back. That suggests Penguin Random House believes the Obamas’ books will sell really well, and keep on selling for a long time. And a book that sells for a while is almost always more profitable than a book that blazes brightly for a year before disappearing. A book that sells 100, 000 copies a year for one year and then fades into obscurity makes a little money, but a book that sells 80, 000 copies a year for 50 years makes a lot of money. There’s good reason to think the Obamas might sell for a good long while. Michelle Obama is less of a known quantity as an author than Barack Obama. (Her only title thus far, American Grown, is a coffee table book that didn’t have the opportunity to pull off any literary pyrotechnics.) But she remains extremely popular and could easily sell a respectable number of books on her own. And before Barack Obama became president, his books Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope cemented his place as not just a politician who sells books on the side, but as an author of genuine literary merit.  It’s not just that Barack Obama’s books sold well  —   although they did, with Dreams from My Father easily   its $40, 000 advance  —   but that they were widely considered to be  . New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani deemed him “that rare politician who can actually write,” with “an elastic, personable voice that is capable of accommodating everything from dense discussions of foreign policy to streetwise reminiscences, incisive comments on constitutional law to   personal asides. ” That means a book by Barack Obama isn’t only a presidential memoir like Bill Clinton’s. It isn’t only a presidential memoir by an extremely popular   during a time when nostalgia for his administration is increasing. It isn’t even only a presidential memoir by our first black president. It’s a presidential memoir that actually stands a chance of being a good book, with both historical and literary merit. And those are the kinds of books that become classics.

"Sweden pays parents for having kids — and it reaps huge benefits. Why doesn’t the US?.  Basic income is all the rage these days. The idea  —   which calls for the government to give everyone in a given     enough money to live in, no strings attached  —   is being tested in Finland, in Ontario, in the Netherlands, and in Kenya. Switzerland’s set to vote on whether to adopt it as a national policy in June.    But discussions of the proposal rarely mention that many rich countries  —   including France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden  —   already implement a version of it. Most Western European countries have what’s called a ”universal child benefit,” or a basic income going only to families with children. It’s a much simpler way to support families than the complicated system the US uses, and an American version could vastly reduce child poverty, perhaps eliminating it altogether. At least 10 rich countries have universal child benefit policies For a widely employed policy, universal child benefits (also known as ”child allowances”) keep a pretty low profile. That’s partly because many countries with them also have a variety of other   programs, such as child care subsidies or child tax breaks limited to people who work or   welfare. Universal child benefit plans, however, stand out for being truly accessible to all: Children and families get them no matter if they work or not, and no matter if they plan to spend the money on child care or food or rent or what.    As of 2012, at least 11 rich countries had policies like that, according to the University of Antwerp’s Minimum Income Protection Indicators (MIPI) database: Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. Here’s how much families get in each of them, illustrated in a lovely graphic by Vox’s Javier Zarracina:                 Data from the The CSB Minimum Income Protection Indicators database. France’s program is designed largely to encourage childbearing, and so only kicks in for families with two or more children.    The laws have changed a bit since the database was last updated. The UK no longer has a universal benefit; the current Conservative government started   the child benefit for   and   households, beginning in 2013. As the University of York’s Jonathan Bradshaw, an expert on child benefits, noted upon the policy introduction, it makes the UK ”one of the very few countries in Europe that do not have a universal child benefit.” On the other hand, Canada recently boosted its child benefits. The new Liberal government under Justin Trudeau is scrapping the current byzantine array of child support programs  —   which include, no joke, benefits for hockey lessons  —   in favor of a new benefit of CA$6, 400 (US$4, 935) per child under six and CA$5, 400 (US$4, 164) per child aged 6 to 17. The amounts are gradually reduced, but families making up to CA$180, 000 (US$140, 000) will at least get something. It’s not a true universal system, but it’s nearly universal. Cash assistance can dramatically cut child poverty The best rationale for universal child benefits is that they substantially reduce child poverty.    Consider what happened when Tony Blair and the Labour Party introduced a universal benefit in the UK in 1999. The measure was part of a broader set of proposals meant to tackle child poverty, including tax credits,   programs, a national minimum wage, a workers’ tax credit, universal   expanded child care, and much longer parental leave. The result was that absolute poverty fell by more than half from 1999 to 2009, while relative poverty (the share of children under 60 percent of the median income) fell by 15 percent; things got dramatically better for the poor, but because the middle class gained too the relative poverty fall was smaller. While child poverty in the US declined slightly over the same period, a comparison of the two trend lines is still startling:            The researchers Tom Sefton, John Hills, and Holly Sutherland concluded that the benefit and tax credit increases from 1997 to 2005 caused incomes for the bottom 10 percent of households to grow 20 percent. ”It was one of the largest [increases] in any of the rich countries for which reliable data are available,” the University of Arizona’s Lane Kenworthy notes. There’s every reason to think a universal child benefit could pull off a similar reduction in child poverty, and improvement in living standards for the poor, in the US. A recent report for the Century Foundation by Columbia researchers Irwin Garfinkel, David Harris, Jane Waldfogel, and Christopher Wimer ran simulations of a variety of different child allowance plans to see how they’d affect child poverty in the US:             A $2, 500 per child benefit in the US would cut the number of children in poverty from 12. 2 million to 8. 4 million, a drop of nearly a third. A $4, 000 benefit would cut the number to 5. 8 million, getting the child poverty rate below 10 percent for the first time in American history. It wouldn’t be cheap  —   the pricier option would cost $202. 9 billion a year on top of the existing cost of the child tax credit  —   but the benefits would be enormous. Child poverty costs the US an estimated $500 billion a year through reduced adult earnings, increased crime, poorer health, and so on. Fighting it is not just the right thing to do; it’s the financially prudent thing as well. The benefits aren’t misspent, either. Sam Houston State University’s Christian Raschke has found that Kindergeld, the delightfully named German child benefit program, leads families to increase spending on food, but not on drinking of alcohol. One study of EITC, the US cash transfer program, found that receiving cash actually leads parents to get prenatal care which in turn reduces the amount they smoke and drink.    And cash benefits help kids in other ways, too The benefits of cash transfers last for affected children’s whole lifetimes. There are reams of evidence, both in the US and abroad, suggesting that programs that put more cash in the hands of families with children can dramatically help those children later on in life, by boosting their test scores, making them healthier, and promoting higher earnings once they start working. Consider, for example, the effects of the Earned Income Tax Credit in the US. The EITC is not a real child allowance, but it is a cash transfer program targeted almost exclusively at families with children. And as this review of the evidence by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities indicates, its benefits for children, across their lifespans, are considerable:            UC Berkeley’s Hilary Hoynes, UConn’s David Simon, and UC Davis’s Douglas Miller have found that the EITC substantially improves infant health, reducing the rate of   births by 6. 7 to 10. 8 percent. The effect was even bigger for   children. Their paper suggests that the credit improves prenatal care. Economist Kevin Baker found similar effects on birth weight, as did did the University of Albany’s Kate Strully, Stanford’s David Rehkopf, and Boston University’s Ziming Xuan. Two studies, one by Michigan State’s Michelle Maxfield and the other by Stanford’s Raj Chetty, Brown’s John N. Friedman, and Columbia’s Jonah Rockoff, have found that EITC boosts test scores, odds of graduating from high school, and odds of attending college. Chetty and his   also link it, through its effect on test scores, to a decline in teen birth rates and an increase in adult earnings of about 0. 5 percent. For an average   to    adult making $31, 219 a year, that’s an extra $156 a year, because of a tax credit their parents got. UCSD’s Gordon Dahl and University of Western Ontario’s Lance Lochner also found positive effects on test scores, and UT Austin’s Dayanand Manoli and the Treasury Department’s Nicholas Turner confirmed the other findings on the credit boosting college attendance. Research on   cash programs has largely found the same thing. A study of childcare subsidies in Norway by  ’s Sandra Black, University College Dublin’s Paul Devereux, University of Bergen’s Katrine Løken, and the Norwegian School of Economics’ Kjell Salvanes found that they significantly increased children’s academic performance, just by boosting parents’ disposable income.    Duke’s Jane Costello has found the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians’s casino dividend to its members decreased psychological problems among children, cut crime rates, and increased   high school graduation rates. University of British Columbia’s Kevin Milligan and University of Toronto’s Mark Stabile have found that Canada’s child benefit expansions have boosted test scores and health outcomes. Libertad González at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona found that a   universal child benefit program in Spain increased the time mothers spend with children in the first year of life and reduced the risk of couples with newborn babies breaking up. Cash subsidies can even extend kids’ lifespans. Brown’s Anna Aizer, University of Toronto’s Shari Eli, Northwestern’s Joseph Ferrie, and UCLA’s Adriana   looked at the Mothers’ Pension program, the first federal welfare program in American history, which ran from 1911 to 1935. They found that male children of mothers who got accepted for the program lived one year longer, got more schooling, and had incomes 14 percent greater than children of mothers who got rejected. Why America in particular could use a universal child benefit             A universal child benefit would be particularly attractive in the US, which currently offers basically no cash assistance for families with children and no earnings. Weak labor markets for people with low skills and little education can prevent   parents from getting steady work, and limit their benefits from the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, both of which only go to households that earned money working. Theoretically, Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) should provide assistance to such families, but only about a quarter of families in poverty get TANF because it’s so difficult to succeed in applying for benefits. As Kathryn Edin,   of the book $2 a Day, told me, ”It’s really a shadow of itself   …     It’s dead, and where it’s really dead is in the imaginations and thought processes of the poor. This is not seen as a fallback. In most cases, it doesn’t occur to people to apply.” Food stamps help such families stay afloat, but you can’t use food stamps to pay rent or bus fare or gas or any of the other   expenses poor families face. A universal benefit, by contrast, would offer thousands of dollars to struggling families outside the labor force, letting them escape deep poverty, and letting some escape poverty altogether. Creating a child benefit would also enable a great deal of tax simplification. Currently, the Earned Income Tax Credit aims to both reward work and provide additional support to families with more children; a child benefit would let it focus on the former, and enable a transformation into a streamlined work credit that helps childless workers, who currently get basically nothing from the EITC.    You could probably also do away with the   Child and Dependent Care Credit, head of household filing status, and the dependent exemption, all three of which are tax benefits reserved for families with positive income tax bills  —   that is, not the poor or lower middle class. Those changes, along with getting rid of the child tax credit, would save about $100 billion a year, which could be used to partially fund a new universal child benefit. Edin and University of Michigan sociologist Luke Shaefer have documented an alarming increase in the share of American households in extreme poverty, relying on only food stamps, and sometimes not even that, to get by. It was, they argued, an inevitable result of welfare reform, which replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) a deeply flawed cash assistance program that nonetheless kept many families afloat, with TANF, which helps far fewer. No one would argue for bringing back AFDC as it was  . But a universal child benefit would bring back the program’s biggest benefits, without discouraging work and while supporting   families as well. ",-1.0
"Forget conspiracy theories. This is why Trump’s Russian connection is actually a problem..  In the past 12 hours, a flurry of stories have come out on Donald Trump’s links to Russia. One such story, at Slate, suggests that a server owned by Trump has been communicating with a Russian bank with ties to the Kremlin. Another, at Mother Jones, quotes an unnamed former intelligence officer claiming that Trump is a Russian operative, one who has been ”compromised” by Moscow ”for at least 5 years.”    These stories are overblown, for reasons my colleagues Matt Yglesias and Timothy Lee explain rather well. Cybersecurity experts believe the server in question is most likely sending spam emails from Trump hotels, not secret missives to Russian handlers, and the FBI has found no credible evidence that Trump has direct ties to Russian intelligence. The problem with these stories isn’t just that they’re speculative. It’s that they obscure and even discredit the more sober evidence about Trump’s troubling attitude toward the Russian state. There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump’s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump’s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.    You don’t need to construct poorly evidenced conspiracy theories to explain this. There is a confluence of interests between the Kremlin and Donald Trump, and they are, in effect, helping each other. Russia’s role in the election is plenty worrying without positing any Manchurian Candidate plots. Here’s why.    We know that Russia is hacking Clinton allies and dumping their info to WikiLeaks             There used to be some doubt as to whether Russia was behind the hacking of various people and organizations close to Hillary Clinton and the dump of their private emails to WikiLeaks. No longer. The evidence that Russia is behind the two most significant hacks, of the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton aide John Podesta, is beyond any reasonable doubt.    The hacker who claims to be behind the DNC hack, Guccifer 2. 0, is quite clearly a Russian cutout. His name is a reference to Marcel Lazăr Lehel  —   a   Romanian hacker who famously claimed to have hacked Hillary Clinton’s private email server. Lehel’s nom de plume was, you guessed it, Guccifer. So what’s the evidence he’s a Russian cutout? For one thing, Guccifer 2. 0 doesn’t actually appear to speak Romanian. Vice’s Lorenzo   interviewed him, mostly in English but with a few Romanian questions peppered in. Guccifer tried to dodge chatting in his allegedly native language, and, per   ”the few short sentences he sent in Romanian were filled with mistakes.” For another, three cybersecurity firms investigated the hack and found direct evidence that two   hacking groups, Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, did the DNC hack.    Perhaps most compellingly, they found that the malware infecting the DNC used an IP address that had previously been used in a hack targeting the German parliament. The German hack was  —   you guessed it  —   linked to Russian intelligence. It’s very unlikely that some other hacking group would use such similar code. ”The forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations is very strong,” Thomas Rid, a professor at King’s College who studies cybersecurity, wrote at Vice. ”The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys.” There’s similarly strong evidence linking Russian operatives to the Podesta hack. The attack that got Podesta is something called ”phishing.” In a phishing campaign, hackers send emails that are dressed up to look like something from a trustworthy source  —   in Podesta’s case, Gmail security. The emails tell the recipient to click on a link or attachment, which seems authentic but actually contains some nasty code that gives the hacker access to the target’s email account. Podesta fell for the phishing scam, hook, line, and sinker (if you’ll pardon the pun). Generally, these attacks are highly effective, because they rely on human gullibility: our willingness to trust things that basically look legit. They’re also hard to trace, because there’s usually nothing in the email to give away the source. But the Russian hackers messed up. The link they got Podesta to click on used an account from a public   service, Bitly, which the cybersecurity firm SecureWorks had been tracking. That Bitly account, according to SecureWorks, belonged to Fancy Bear.    The hackers’ laziness, or lack of caution, exposed their operation, negating one of the core advantages of a phishing attack. ”Unless you screw up and make your phishing campaign linkable like this group apparently did, it is very hard to attribute to any given actor,” Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, wrote to me via email in October. In short: Russian operatives were sloppy enough to link themselves to two different hacks of Democrats. The idea that they’re not interfering in the US election is, at this point, just not credible. The hacks fit squarely within Russian strategic doctrine            The bigger picture here is that Russia under Putin has something of a habit of using information as a weapon in foreign countries. This is born, as the New York Times’s Max Fisher explains, from a traumatic experience Russia had in the  . A series of   strongmen in former Eastern Bloc states were toppled by the   ”Color Revolutions.” In 2011, protests in Moscow threatened the very stability of the Putin regime itself. These were seen, in the paranoid climate of Moscow, as American intelligence operations. As a result, Russian strategic leaders came to see the internal politics of other countries as a key battlefield.    Fisher points to a 2013 article, by Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, as key evidence of this new Russian thinking. Gerasimov argued that ”  means” had eclipsed weapons in their strategic importance. Controlling the information and propaganda environment can inflict serious blows on one’s enemies. ”The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness,” Gerasimov writes. He advocates using ”military means of a concealed character,” including ”actions of informational conflict” in order to accomplish Russian strategic objectives. Gerasimov’s article uses the Arab Spring as a key example, which is telling. The Arab Spring wasn’t about wars between countries but rather upheaval inside countries. Gerasimov’s ideas, then, are explicitly designed to be used in attempts to influence other countries’ internal politics and conflicts. That’s exactly what Russia is doing when it hands over the information to WikiLeaks. When you hand stolen information that’s damaging to Hillary Clinton to a radical transparency group that detests Hillary Clinton (mostly because of her relatively hawkish foreign policy) the result is eminently predictable: That information will be published online for the entire world to see. The disclosures bring to light information that makes it seem like the American democratic process is fundamentally illegitimate. Some of the emails usually show normal    maneuvering and activity that just looks shady because it happened in private, like Neera Tanden, head of the ideologically friendly Center for American Progress, emailing the Clinton campaign to talk about coordinating a Supreme Court message. Others show shadier stuff, like Democratic National Committee staffers discussing plans to undermine the Bernie Sanders campaign. The result of either kind of leak,   normal activity or actual malfeasance, is embarrassing to the United States and weakens the next likely president (Hillary Clinton) even before she takes office.    So it’s not just that the hack looks traceable back to Russian hackers. It’s that the strategic effect of the leak  —   releasing information that breeds infighting among American political factions   —   fits squarely within Russian strategic doctrine. It looks a lot like Russia is running Gerasimov’s playbook in America. Trump’s policies are objectively              As the evidence suggesting Russia is behind the leak and the hack mounted, a number of theories cropped up as to why, exactly, Putin would do this. What’s the ultimate endgame of attacking Clinton? Well, here’s the Occam’s razor explanation: Nothing Russia could do, on its own, would help its foreign policy more than what Trump is proposing. He is literally suggesting the United States transform global politics to make it more favorable to Russian interests. Trump’s approach to American allies, specifically the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, is the biggest reason. Traditionally, American parties have seen its alliance commitments, NATO in particular, as ironclad guarantees  —   the core part of America’s global strategy. Trump doesn’t agree. He thinks that alliances are only useful as tools for extracting money. The US is the strongest power in the world, Trump reasons  —   why protect tiny NATO allies like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania if they don’t pay up? At the very least, Trump has said, they should spend more on their own defense if they want to expect American protection.    If Trump put his ideas into practice and actually renounced commitments that didn’t do what he wanted, it would destroy NATO. The alliance depends entirely on an ironclad guarantee on behalf of all allies to defend any one of them  —   that is literally what it does. If the US won’t do that, then NATO is effectively dead. This is music to Putin’s ears. He sees the NATO alliance (correctly!) as a major bulwark against Russian expansionism in Eastern Europe, and would be thrilled if it fractured. That would make it far easier to install friendly dictators in small nearby countries, like Estonia, or even annex them entirely. A Trump victory, then, seems like it might allow Putin to fulfill his fundamental foreign policy goal  —   reviving Russia’s   influence over its region  —   to a degree previously thought impossible. Trump seems totally oblivious to the fact that he would be throwing US allies under the bus  —   and, in fact, oblivious to Putin’s hostility toward the United States entirely. For example, he has effusively praised Russia’s bombing campaign in Syria: ”What’s wrong with Russia bombing the hell out of ISIS and these other crazies so we don’t have to spend a million dollars a bomb?” Never mind that Russian bombs have targeted the relatively moderate opposition more than ISIS, and that the point is to prop up Syrian dictator Bashar   rather than defeat ISIS. Trump sees Russia as more of a partner than an adversary  —   mostly because he doesn’t seem to care about the independence of Eastern Europe or Syria’s freedom from dictatorship.    All Trump cares about, instead, is getting more money for the United States, as he’s said: ”My whole life I’ve been greedy, greedy, greedy.   …     But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money.” His theories for how to do that  —   like spending less on alliances and other foreign commitments  —   line up exactly with a series of Russian foreign policy objectives. Moreover, Trump seems to admire Putin personally. ”I will tell you that, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an ’A’ and our president is not doing so well,” Trump said during the NBC    Forum in September. He even, weirdly, invented a story about the two of them becoming best buds in the green room before a 60 Minutes episode. ”I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, we did well that night,” Trump said on CBS’s Face the Nation back in November 2015. This meeting never happened: The two men were interviewed by different journalists on different continents. But it must comfort Putin to know that Trump’s ideas align with Russia’s interest, and that Trump himself is deeply impressed by Putin as a leader. ”That Russia is pulling for Trump is at this point beyond any dispute,” New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait writes. ”Putin’s Russia has been proven or credibly alleged to have boosted friendly candidates in France, Germany, Austria, and, most successfully, in the election of a   government in Ukraine. Something like this seems to be happening in the American presidential election now.” Chait’s ”beyond any dispute” is kind of an overstatement. Figuring out what Putin’s exact thoughts on the American election are  —   well, it’s literal Kremlinology. It is quite possible that the Russians don’t believe they can make Trump win, and just want to weaken Clinton and distract Americans from foreign policy.    But if they actually are trying to make Trump win, it would make a certain kind of sense. There’s never been a major party candidate in the modern era more friendly to a Russian dictator’s interests. Trump and his top advisers have taken a lot of money from Russian interests   Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow   if so, will he become my new best friend?  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013    There is no good evidence, despite suggestions to the contrary from Slate and Mother Jones, that Trump is in on such a plot  —   that he’s actively working with the Russians to get himself into the White House. Not only that, but his actual behavior militates against it: It would be very dumb for a Russian operative to openly announce his friendliness toward the Kremlin during a campaign. Yet you can see where the conspiracy theorists are coming from. Trump’s campaign staff and businesses have a disturbing number of connections to Russia and Russian interests. This isn’t exactly evidence of Trump being a secret agent, but it does raise serious questions about the kind of advice that he would get in the White House. Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was rumored to be on Trump’s VP shortlist. Flynn is currently a regular guest on RT, Russia’s   propaganda outlet, and he will not disclose whether the channel pays him. When he attended RT’s 10th anniversary party, he sat at the head table with Putin himself. Carter Page, another Trump foreign policy adviser, has served as an adviser for Gazprom, Russia’s   energy corporation. As recently as March 2016, he said he owned shares in the company.    ”Page has defended Russia with relish,” Slate’s Franklin Foer writes. ”He wrote a column explicitly comparing the Obama administration’s Russia policy to chattel slavery in the American South.” You can see where people get the impression that the Kremlin might wield some direct influence over Trump: More than one key adviser has direct business links to the Russian state. Interestingly, so does Trump himself. We can’t be sure exactly how much, as he refuses to release his tax returns. But his son, Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that ”Russians make up a pretty disproportionate   of a lot of our assets.” The Washington Post has a great investigation into Trump’s ”30 year” history of trying to build in Russia. I’d encourage you to read the whole thing, but here’s the most relevant bit:  Trump’s partners on a Panama project traveled to Moscow in 2006 to sell condos to Russian investors, according to litigation filed in Florida. Trump also sold a mansion in Palm Beach in 2008 for $95 million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, according to property records. Trump had purchased the mansion at a bankruptcy auction less than four years earlier for $41. 4 million, records show. In 2013, Trump found a new Russian partner for a Moscow real estate project, Aras Agalarov, an   real estate developer who is sometimes called the ”Trump of Russia” for his tendency to emblazon his name on his development projects. The Agalarovs are wealthy developers who have received several contracts for   construction projects, a sign of their closeness to the Putin government. Shortly after the pageant, Putin awarded the elder Agalarov the ”Order of Honor of the Russian Federation,” a prestigious designation.  So Trump not only has a long history of investing in Russia but also has a recent history of working with   oligarchs.    As extensive as these ties to Russia are, they still don’t vindicate the secret agent theory. Again, it’s kind of the opposite: Leaving such a public paper trail back to your paymaster would be incredibly incompetent tradecraft. No, the issue instead is that everything about Trump  —   his advisers, his personal feelings on Putin, his own business interests  —   incline him toward seeing things from the Kremlin’s point of view. It’s easy to see Trump’s   policies as a kind of novice mistake. Trump doesn’t know much about foreign policy, the reasoning goes, and so his policy preferences are the result of pure ignorance. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. Instead of picking advisers from the   neoconservative camp, which dominated GOP foreign policy before Trump, he has drawn some of the most   people around. Trump sees Russia as a hot market, and has chosen to get into bed with suspiciously   figures. He sees Putin as a model leader, not a disturbing authoritarian. All of this suggests that Trump has thought a fair amount about   stuff, and come down on the Russian side. His skepticism about NATO and support for Russia’s intervention in Syria, then, are not incidental parts of his platform. They reflect the candidate’s actual worldview, and likely predict how he would act in office. How to think about Trump and the Kremlin            So we come back to a basic question: How should we see the Kremlin’s role in the 2016 race?    The right approach, I think, is to avoid focusing too heavily on the question of whether Russia actively wants to plant Trump in the White House. That’s obviously incendiary, and makes for great headlines. But it’s more or less unknowable. It’s also irrelevant. The key question about any politician isn’t his ”real” motivation for doing something; it’s what he actually does when entrusted with power. On that count, we now know two important facts about Putin and Trump, respectively. The first is that Russian state interests are intervening in an American election, in a way that hurts Hillary Clinton and thus furthers Donald Trump’s electoral ambitions. The Kremlin, intentionally or not, is serving as a kind of   Super PAC, albeit one with access to hackers. The second is that Trump is deeply committed to reorienting American foreign policy in a   direction. He’s said that he’ll do that, repeatedly, and both his campaign and his personal life give us every reason to believe he’s absolutely serious. Given the power of the US presidency, Trump could go beyond merely altering American foreign policy. If he’s really serious about it, he could alter the very fundamental fabric of global politics, weakening core institutions like NATO that Russia hates. Hillary Clinton, a solid establishmentarian who’s hated by Russia, would do nothing of the kind.    Those are some pretty high stakes. ",-1.0
"Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on ‘self-dealing,’ new filing to IRS shows.    Donald Trump’s charitable foundation has admitted to the Internal Revenue Service that it violated a legal prohibition against “” which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity’s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families. The admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation’s IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the   site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation’s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. The Washington Post could not immediately confirm if the same forms had actually been sent to the IRS. In one section of the form, the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred “income or assets to a disqualified person. ” A disqualified person, in this context, might be Trump  —   the foundation’s president  —   or a member of his family or a   business. The foundation checked yes.  For 2015, the Trump Foundation checked “yes” when asked whether it had transferred “income or assets to a disqualified person”  —   which in this context might be Trump, a member of his family or a   business  —   and checked “yes” again when asked if it had engaged in any acts of   in prior years. For 2014, The foundation answered “no” to these questions.  Another line on the form asked whether the Trump Foundation had engaged in any acts of   in prior years. The Trump Foundation checked yes again. Such violations can carry penalties including excise taxes, and the charity leaders can be required to repay money that the charity spent on their behalf. During the presidential campaign, The Post reported on several instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation’s money to buy items for himself or to help one of his   businesses. But the new Trump Foundation tax filings provided little detail, so it was unclear if these admissions were connected to the instances reported in The Post.  The Trump Foundation tax forms did not, for instance, describe any specific acts of  . They also did not say whether Trump had paid any penalties already. That kind of detail would be submitted on a separate IRS form, which was not included in the information posted online by GuideStar. Trump’s team did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.     Washington Post reporter David A. Fahrenthold has been searching for evidence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s charitable giving for months. (Peter Stevenson, Julio   Washington Post)   The New York attorney general’s office is investigating Trump’s charity, following up on reports in The Post that described apparent instances of   going back to 2007. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment, other than to say “our investigation is ongoing. ” The IRS also did not immediately respond. That agency has not said if it is investigating the  ’s charity. The Trump Foundation has existed since 1987. This appeared to be the first time that it had admitted committing such a violation. Philip Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS chief counsel’s office and now teaches at Louisiana State University, said he wanted to know why the Trump Foundation was now admitting to   in prior years  —   when, in all prior years, it had told the IRS it had done nothing of the kind. “What transactions led to the   that they’re admitting to? Why weren’t they able to recognize them in prior years,” Hackney said. He said that, since the prior years’ returns were signed by Trump, that opened the   to questions about what he had missed and how.  During the presidential campaign, The Post revealed several instances  —   worth about $300, 000  —   where Trump seemed to have used the Trump Foundation to help himself. From 2009 until this year, the charity was funded exclusively with other people’s money, an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation. In two cases, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation appeared to pay legal settlements to end lawsuits that involved his   businesses. In one case, Trump settled a dispute with the town of Palm Beach, Fla. over a large flagpole he erected at his    Club. The town agreed to waive $120, 000 in unpaid fines if Trump’s club donated $100, 000 to Fisher House, a charity helping wounded veterans and military personnel. The Trump Foundation paid that donation instead  —   effectively saving his business $100, 000. In another, Trump’s golf course in New York’s Westchester County was sued by a man who had won a $1 million    prize during a tournament at the course. The man was later denied the money because Trump’s course had allegedly made the hole too short for the prize to be valid. The lawsuit was settled, and details on that final settlement have not been made public. But on the day that the parties told the court that their lawsuit had been settled, the Trump Foundation donated $158, 000 to the unhappy golfer’s charity. Trump’s golf course donated nothing. In three other cases, Trump’s foundation paid for items that Trump or his wife purchased at charity auctions. In 2012, Trump bid $12, 000 for a football helmet signed by   Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. In another case from 2007, Trump’s wife, Melania, bid $20, 000 on a    portrait of Trump painted by “speed painter” Michael Israel during a gala at   . And in 2014, Trump bid $10, 000 to buy a   painting of himself by artist Havi Schanz at another charity gala.  In all three cases, the Trump Foundation paid the bill. Tax experts said that, by law, the items had to be put to charitable use. Trump’s representatives have not said what became of the helmet or the $20, 000 portrait. The $10, 000 portrait was, however, located by Post readers, following coverage of the Trump Foundation. It was hanging on the wall of the sports bar at Trump’s Doral golf resort, outside Miami. In September, a Trump campaign spokesman rejected the idea that Trump had done anything wrong, by using his charity’s money to buy art for his bar. Instead, spokesman Boris Epshteyn said, the sports bar was doing the charity a favor by “storing” its art free of charge. Tax experts said that this argument was unlikely to hold water. “It’s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,” Brett Kappel, a lawyer who advises nonprofit groups at the Akerman firm, told The Post then. “But this would do it. ” In the new 2015 tax filing, the Trump Foundation acknowledged for the first time that it owned these items. But it listed market values far below what the foundation had paid: The helmet was valued at $475, the portrait purchased for $20, 000 was valued at $700, and the portrait purchased for $10, 000 was valued at $500. The tax filing did not give any details about where these items are or what charitable use Trump has in mind for them. The Trump Foundation’s tax filing also shows that  —   for the first time in six years  —   the foundation received a donation from an entity controlled by Trump himself. It lists a donation of $566, 370 from the Trump Corporation, an entity 100 percent owned by Trump himself. It also lists a $50, 000 gift from Trump Productions, a   business that produced “The Apprentice. ” Previously, the last donation to the foundation from Trump or one of his businesses had come in 2008. Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about the reason for these new gifts. In addition, the Trump Foundation reported a $150, 000 gift from the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a powerful Ukrainian steel magnate. That was the first such gift from him. Pinchuk, who supports closer ties between Ukraine and Western nations, had also pledged large donations to the foundation of Trump’s presidential opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Those donations, pledged to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state, raised questions about whether she had conflicts of interest when she met with her family foundation’s donors. A spokesman for Pinchuk’s foundation said that the gift was made as part of an agreement for Trump to speak  —   via video link  —   to a conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. The conference, called the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting, was held in Kiev. At the time of his   speech, titled “How New Ukraine’s Fate Affects Europe and the World,” Trump was already a presidential candidate. Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about Pinchuk’s gift.  Marc S. Owens, the former head of the IRS nonprofit division, noted that this was a rare contribution to the Trump Foundation from overseas. The only other foreign gifts were small ones from New Zealand and Canada in 2006 and 2008. And it was certainly the first from a foreigner who could seek to influence the foreign policy agenda of a President Trump. “The contribution points out a potential way for foreign donors to align themselves with [Trump],” Owens said. So far, Trump has said nothing about how he will run his foundation when he takes office  —   or what he will do to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving Trump Foundation donors. In contrast, when she was preparing to take office as secretary of state in 2009, Clinton was closely questioned about the operations of the global charity founded by her husband. As a result, the president of the Clinton Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration that placed certain restrictions on its activities, notably limiting some donations from foreign governments. The agreement was criticized by Republicans during the campaign for loopholes, and the Clinton Foundation has also acknowledged at least one failure to fully uphold its terms. But the document showed an understanding that some additional transparency and regulations were needed while Clinton held public office. “I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised,” Clinton said during her 2009 confirmation hearing. “But I think that the way that this has been hammered out is as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it, and we’ve tried to do the very best we could. ” The Post was first alerted to the 2015 tax filing by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. In a written statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said many questions remained to be answered. “Why were the Trumps unable to provide locations of the Foundation’s assets like paintings and football helmets . . . when they clearly remain in the possession of the Foundation? What assets do [they] admit to transferring to a ‘disqualified person?’ ” Libowitz wrote. “It’s pretty clear at this point that the IRS needs to investigate. ” In all, the 2015 tax filing shows that the Trump Foundation took in $781, 000 and gave away $896, 000 in grants during 2015. That left it with $1. 1 million at year’s end, slightly down from the year before.  An early look at its outgoing grants showed a familiar pattern: Trump gave to a smattering of New York and Florida charities, plus a few connected to friends and business partners. Also, as he entered the presidential race, he gave to several nonprofit organizations connected with conservative causes. One of them was Project Veritas, the group run by conservative provocateur James O’Keefe, which has used   stings to target liberal groups. Stephen Gordon, of Project Veritas, said that its point of contact had been Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s   campaign manager. He said they had a brief meeting with Trump in 2015 at Trump Tower. Trump gave $10, 000 from his foundation to the group, which is an   nonprofit organization. “We showed him a couple of videos. He thought that was really cool. And we walked out with a check. It was a typical donor meeting,” Gordon recalled.  Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report. ",-0.5
"Please stop calling everything Trump does ‘unprecedented’. President Trump practically can’t sneeze without critics calling it unprecedented or over the top. Yet time and again, it turns out other presidents, including Barack Obama, have done nearly the same thing  —   with nary a peep from the haters. Take Trump’s criticism of a ruling against his travel restrictions and his slam of Judge James Robart as a “  judge. ” On CNN, Dean Obeidallah called it “ ” and warned of a “dictatorship. ” Slate termed it a “temper tantrum. ” Others saw an unprecedented attempt to “delegitimize” the judiciary (never mind all the lefties insisting Trump is not their president). But, as law prof Josh Blackman gently puts it, Trump is far from the only president to “question the legitimacy of judicial decisions. ” Obama publicly  —   during a State of the Union Address, no less  —   bashed the Supreme Court justices (to their faces) after their Citizens United ruling. More to the point, as challenges to his   law moved through the courts, he warned of “unelected” justices nixing a law passed by “a democratically elected Congress. ” (And other top Democrats suggested they’d even call the high court’s legitimacy into question if it ruled the “wrong” way.) Blackman, based on careful study, calls Obama the worst “offender in modern history” when it comes to opining on pending Supreme Court cases. Trump also caused conniptions with his decision to let top aide Steve Bannon join the National Security Council, a directive that also noted the director of national intelligence and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman need attend only as necessary. That, too, won cries of “unprecedented. ” Oops: Obama let his adviser, David Axelrod, regularly attend NSC meetings. And Trump’s language in his memo on the DNI and the Joint Chiefs chairman is almost identical to   George W. Bush’s. (Turns out, they have no reason to show when the topics are purely domestic.) Critics went similarly ballistic over Team Trump’s “gag order,” limiting official   accounts at agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency until his appointees can take over. Oops again: The New York Times cited employees at three agencies who’d gone through several transitions calling it “standard practice. ” Look: Trump is indeed unusual  —   it’s one reason he won in the first place. But the hysterics help no one, not even the left’s own cause, by ignorantly “going to 11” without checking the facts.",1.0

But they didn’t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn’t in government. People don’t go around asking about NATO if I’m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf … asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO’s obsolete—not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO—NATO is obsolete, and I said, “And the reason it’s obsolete is because of the fact they don’t focus on terrorism.” You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.

"Blueprint to fix Mets begins with Brandon Nimmo and d’Arnaud. For the second straight Father’s Day, the Mets recorded just one hit against Julio Teheran to complete an upset, upsetting weekend sweep at the hands of the lowly Braves. Now all Terry Collins’ group has to do is figure out how the heck to get from this point back to the World Series, and they’ll be golden. Welcome to a low point and defining moment for the defending National League champions.   drew waves of deserved boos from the announced Citi Field crowd of 41, 576. It dropped the Mets both into third place in the NL East, thanks to the Marlins’ victory over Colorado, and out of   position, thanks to the Dodgers’ win over the Brewers. And it prompted Collins to say after the game, “You don’t want to panic early, but right now, with what’s going on, we may shake some things up. ” They should do just that, within the context of reality. When they host the Royals on Tuesday night, going against Kansas City starter Ian Kennedy, both Travis d’Arnaud and Brandon Nimmo should be in the starting lineup for the 2015 Fall Classic reunion. D’Arnaud, set to complete his rehabilitation stint Sunday night, will be there barring something crazy happening. And it would be crazy to not give Nimmo, the prodigal Wyomingite, a shot, with either Michael Conforto or Alejandro De Aza departing to make room. The Mets need to try something different now, and Yulieski Gourriel won’t be here by Tuesday.   the Cuban free agent Gourriel likely would need a month or so of   action to get acclimated, so even if the Mets were to sign him, he’d take a while to marinate. None of the potential trade targets for third base  —   the Angels’ Yunel Escobar, Milwaukee’s Aaron Hill, San Diego’s Yangervis Solarte or Oakland’s Danny Valencia  —   is probable to get dealt before   and   regardless for the Mets’ drained farm system. So in   you go smaller and, in this instance, internal. You count on d’Arnaud, even if rusty, to upgrade what has been by far the Mets’ worst offensive position. You send the disappointing Kevin Plawecki to   Las Vegas. Then you get Nimmo up here. Maybe it’s never going to happen for the Mets’ top draft pick of 2011, Sandy Alderson’s first selection as general manager. Maybe the . . . 520 slash line Nimmo compiled in his first 57 games for Vegas this season, in 256 plate appearances, is wholly a byproduct of playing in the ridiculously   Pacific Coast League. Yet the Mets have little to lose by bringing up Nimmo, 23, and seeing what he can do at the   level. I’d advocate jettisoning De Aza, who became superfluous the moment the Mets   Yoenis Cespedes, and letting the hideously slumping Conforto take a few days off and endure a   tutorial with hitting coach Kevin Long. From the way Collins spoke Sunday, however,   and hanging onto De Aza and his $5. 75 million salary. “He’s not going to come off the bench,” Collins said of Conforto, who could be a disabled list candidate with an ailing right wrist. “We’re going to look at every angle we can. ” The feisty Collins defended his hitters, opining that Teheran pitched brilliantly  —   he went the distance this time, whereas he threw seven innings last June 21 at Turner Field  —   and scolding his weekend starting pitchers, including Sunday’s loser Jacob deGrom,  . While those might be valid points, there’s no disputing that the Mets’ lack of run production has them in their current predicament. Collins’ urgency has merit when you look at where the schedule takes them after two with the Royals and four at the Braves: three games in Washington and an   homestand against the Cubs (four games) Marlins (three) and Nationals (four). “We’ve got to get better,” Collins said, and he repeated: “We’ve got to start playing better. ” D’Arnaud and Nimmo would give them as close to a fresh start as possible.",1.0
"Hospital turns away 9/11 volunteer for bringing service dog. A   volunteer being treated for PTSD was turned away from a Manhattan hospital Tuesday because he brought his service dog. Security officers at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Washington Heights barred Jaime Hazan from an appointment with his doctor when they spotted his companion, Bernie, a service dog. Hazan explained that the    Golden Doodle is a working service dog and said he felt “humiliated” when he was told that didn’t matter. Hazan captured the incident on an iPhone video that lasted 27 minutes. “You come to a hospital for health care and I’m being detained for being disabled,” Hazan laments on the video. It took four sympathetic NYPD cops called to the scene to resolve the situation and make clear that disability laws protect service dogs. But by that time, Hazan was too late for his appointment. “Because of their total incompetence about the law, they took four men in blue off the street who could be protecting New York,” Hazan told The Post. He believes the situation is particularly “egregious” since the   institute specializes in people with disabilities. ‘You come to a hospital for health care and I’m being detained for being disabled.’ The institute, which is contained in the Columbia University Medical Center, issued an apology when reached by The Post and pledged that the “unfortunate situation” would not happen again. The institute’s policy “specifically states that service animals are welcome, in accordance with state law, federal law, and basic courtesy towards persons with disabilities,” the statement reads. “NYSPI is distressed and perplexed that these employees failed to abide by this policy and will take immediate action to address this incident and to make sure that other visitors are not treated like this going forward. ” Hazan wants the two security officers fired and an investigation by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. “An apology isn’t enough, unfortunately,” Hazan told The Post, who also believes the four NYPD officers should be rewarded. Hazan, a former Rockland County emergency medical technician, volunteered at Ground Zero on Sept. 12, 2001, and has undergone three surgeries for his sinuses, hernia and chronic digestive disease. His PTSD symptoms have improved since Bernie came into his life from Dogs 4 Warriors, which typically provides pups for veterans. Hazan has been an advocate for first responders with health care issues and, in a flood of emotion, gave Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand his EMT badge last year during a celebration of Congress’s renewal of the Zadroga Act. “Senator Gillibrand has not seen the video yet, but thinks he is a hero and has every right to bring his service dog to his doctor’s appointment,” said her spokesman, Marc Brumer. Hazan says he hasn’t had trouble with Bernie until Tuesday. That’s when he pulled out his iPhone and began filming the two safety officers, who wore badges and a patch saying “State of New York Office of Mental Health. ” “Who else are they doing this to? Is it just me? That’s why I have to make a stink,” Hazan told the NYPD cops on the video. “I don’t like doing this but I got to. I don’t like to be a complaining person. I hate being disabled. I can’t stand it. I was never that guy. It took me a long time to get comfortable with the fact that I’m not my old self. ”",1.0

"5 things you can get rid of right now — and what to do with them.  The transition from summer to fall is an ideal time to get your home organized. As you put away all of that summer gear and prepare for cooler weather, why not also commit to clearing out some of the things you no longer need or use? Here are five quick ways to clean out items right now and donate them to an organization that will actually use them.  Luggage Each person in your family needs one or two suitcases. If you have more than that, it’s time to purge. People seem to accumulate a luggage collection that far exceeds their needs, mostly because they don’t know what to do with the suitcases they no longer use and they feel uncomfortable throwing away something that is still useful.  However, there’s no point in storing bulky suitcases that you’re not using, especially when there are organizations that will gladly accept them for kids and families in need. There are organizations in each state that collect donated suitcases for foster children, who often don’t have suitcases to pack their things in when they transition between homes. To find a place to donate luggage near you, visit donateluggage. com. The website makes it easy to locate an organization in your state. In the District, the website will direct you to the National Foster Care Coalition. Also in the District, the Child and Family Services Agency accepts donated suitcases through its Partners for Kids in Care program. Further information can be found at cfsa. dc. gov . Toiletries from hotels We all have a drawer or bin full of hotel shampoos, conditioners, soaps and lotions. We bring them home thinking we’ll definitely use them in our guest room or on a future trip, but somehow never remember to do so. If you’re not using them  —   and, let’s face it, you’re probably not going to  —   why not donate them to a local homeless or women’s shelter? You can find a shelter in your area by visiting homelessshelterdirectory. org or womenshelters. org. New and unopened bottles can also be sent to troops stationed abroad through an organization called Operation: Care and Comfort. Reusable bags Reusable tote bags are such a good idea  —   until you’ve accumulated so many that you can’t actually use, or store, them all. As it turns out, reusable bags aren’t as environmentally friendly as many of us think, particularly because we don’t use them enough to make their production worth it. In fact, they’ve become so popular and so   that a recent article in the Atlantic pointed out, “Their abundance encourages consumers to see them as disposable, defeating their very purpose. ” But instead of throwing away those totes you’re no longer using, donate them to local food pantries, farmers markets and homeless shelters, where they will be used and reused. Or, if you’re donating clothes or toys to a local organization, put your items in reusable bags so that they can be repurposed. Bread for the City in the District lists reusable bags on its wish list of items for donation. Empty picture frames We all seem to be framing fewer pictures, and yet picture frames seem to magically multiply. Sometimes they’re given to us as gifts, and other times we buy them because we intend to use them but then somehow never get around to it. Instead of keeping a collection of empty frames in a box in the basement, donate them to an organization that will give them to people who will use and enjoy them. Organizations that help people transition into homes, in particular, make good recipients of picture frames that are in   condition. Habitat for Humanity’s ReStores and Goodwill, which both have locations in the area, will accept donations of picture frames, as will A Wider Circle, whose headquarters is in Silver Spring.  Glassware I’ve noticed in my recent organizing jobs that many people own hundreds of glasses. Really. Tall water glasses, short water glasses, juice glasses, champagne flutes, red wine glasses, white wine glasses, bar glasses, martini glasses, margarita glasses. I could go on, but you get the idea. Most of us use the same six to eight glasses every day. Sure, you need to have enough for entertaining, but is it necessary to take up valuable kitchen cabinet storage with glassware you seldom use? Spend 30 minutes taking an honest accounting of all that glassware and see if you have at least a dozen items you could donate. I bet you do, and I bet you won’t miss them when they’re gone. There are many organizations in our area that will take glassware, including Interfaith Works, the National Center for Children and Families and Neighbors’ Consejo. Although it’s totally legitimate to try to expand the storage options in your home, sometimes a better option is to just reduce the amount of stuff you need to store. And repurposing items to help someone else makes it even more worthwhile. For a full list of where to donate almost anything in the Washington area, go to charitychoices. com.

"Chrysler Introduces a Concept Minivan at CES Aimed at Millennial Drivers. Fresh off a major overhaul of its stalwart Pacifica minivan, Chrysler has set its sights on the frisky millennials who will soon be queuing up for family-friendly transportation. The Portal concept vehicle, unveiled today at CES, is an all-electric, hyper-designy, semi-autonomous, configurable “third space” between work and home. Sociologists used to use the term “third space” to mean ""a place people go that isn't work or home,"" like a coffeeshop or a bar. And that's kind of how Chrysler means it, too. Except it's a minivan. The Portal does indeed have an airy environment, dynamic LED lighting, and a variety of textures and surfaces.

"Big Little Lies was fantastic. Don’t ruin it with another season..  In a spectacular display of acting talent and the most gorgeously filmed elementary school fundraiser possibly ever, HBO’s Big Little Lies aired its gripping final episode on April 2  —   or did it?    “You Get What You Need” has (rightfully) received stellar reviews across the board for how well it wrapped up seven episodes’ worth of dark and tangled suburban webs. But the finale’s brilliance has also inspired demands for another season of Big Little Lies, even though it was never intended to be anything more than a miniseries, and even though its season covered just about everything that happened in the Liane Moriarty novel that inspired it. Big Little Lies was so good, the argument goes, that it would be a shame not to let it continue.        Related    Big Little Lies season finale, ”You Get What You Need”: a thrilling, terrifying end to the series  But maybe the real shame would be to drag out Big Little Lies’ story when it already gave us such a satisfying ending. There’s a case to be made on both sides. Even the people who worked on Big Little Lies seem split, with Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern egging on fans who are clamoring to see more of their   characters Madeline and Renata, while director   Vallée insists that another season would “break that beautiful thing and spoil it. ”    We love Witherspoon and Dern to distraction (seriously; try to get us to talk about anything else this week). But when it comes to the question of whether or not Big Little Lies should continue, we’re going to go on record as agreeing with Vallée.     (Reader beware: This discussion contains major spoilers for all of Big Little Lies’ seven episodes.)  Big Little Lies wasn’t a perfect show, but it had the perfect ending Alex  : There were a lot of times throughout Big Little Lies’ season that I found myself liking and appreciating the show, in spite of some jangling, tinny writing. During the season finale, I groaned when Shailene Woodley’s Jane says she fears Ziggy might be violent because violence could be in his DNA. It was an example of telling, not showing, and it betrayed Vallée’s deft storytelling over the previous six episodes.  But even with that line, the season and its finale were still so damn good.     My favorite thing about the finale was that it got out of its own way. Vallée cranked up the tension throughout, and unleashed the release in a scene that took your breath away, even to people who correctly predicted all the answers.  The ending, with all of the women and their children frolicking near the ocean  —   while clad in amazing beachwear and being watched by the detective  —   was my favorite part of the finale. You can’t tell if they’re really friends, or if they’re just being nice because they know they’re being watched. It’s a reminder that Big Little Lies was really about that ambiguity, and a reflection on appearances, rather than figuring out who killed whom.  Caroline Framke: That deceptively precise conclusion was everything I ended up loving about Big Little Lies. On the surface, it’s all benevolent smiles and fabulous, windswept hair. And yet  —   as always seems to be the case in Big Little Lies’ version of Monterey, California  —   someone’s still watching the characters’ every move. Hearing that final click of the detective’s lighter gave me chills.    But there’s something else that’s crucial to what the finale does so well. Perry being confirmed as both Jane’s rapist and the person who died was the most obvious answer to those two questions, but the reveal itself barely mattered. I wasn’t surprised, but I wasn’t disappointed. The way Big Little Lies unspooled its endgame in bursts of wicked horror was all I needed. And that’s why I’m so unnerved by the talk of a second season of this show. I don’t need to find out what happens to these characters going forward  —   even though I understand, after getting so invested in them, why other people do. The season finale was the best argument for a second season             Alex: With the way the season ended, I don’t blame anyone for wanting more. Big Little Lies, around its fifth episode, transitioned from a sudsy, pulpy melodrama into something more serious. Two episodes later, we got the climactic peak and the comedown all at once.  I understand that people might want to see the fallout. What happens to Celeste and her kids now that the monster has been vanquished? Can Jane rent the apartment that Celeste got for herself? Is Madeline still willing to wreck her marriage now that she’s seen what hell looks like? Will Renata have another child and not give it a ridiculous name? What’s the best (bad) argument you’ve heard as to why Big Little Lies should get a second season? Caroline: The only argument I’ve heard that makes any sense to me is that no one wants to let go of this cast, which is phenomenal.     Even when the script had them say the most obvious things, everyone was playing at the top of their game. A huge reason why Big Little Lies worked is that its cast was pitch perfect (and I’d give Alexander Skarsgård’s chilling performance some of the credit for that, though he’s not part of the season two conversation, for obvious reasons). And yes, okay, I personally would follow a drunken Madeline McKenzie to the ends of the earth and back, bless her sodden heart.  So I get why people want to see more of Witherspoon’s sparking anger (and surprising vulnerability) Nicole Kidman’s frayed sadness (and capacity for quiet rage) and Dern’s simmering fury. I understand the longing to stay on that beach with the fierce and fantastic moms of Monterey, or to retire to their sprawling porches at dusk and eavesdrop while they swish wine and gossip.  But for as much as I loved watching all these actors get to work, Big Little Lies became special to me over time because I knew its run was limited. I knew I’d get to spend seven hours with these women, their flop husbands, and their unnervingly precocious kids. By the end of the finale, I was totally satisfied with what Big Little Lies had given me  —   and based on the many, many other TV shows that have long overstayed their welcome on the air, I don’t want that fate to even be a possibility for Big Little Lies. TV shows  —   and stories in general  —   sometimes need an expiration date             Alex: You make an interesting point about shows “that have long overstayed their welcome. ” I can’t help but think of The Walking Dead, which coincidentally aired its season seven finale on the same night Big Little Lies concluded.  That show feels like it would benefit from an end date.  This past season ended in the same place it was in at the beginning: with the threat of Negan looming. Not only that, but Negan’s storyline is really similar to that of the Governor, who was defeated in season three and then returned for a full reckoning in season four. Everything The Walking Dead has done lately is been there, done that, gone back again. Further, each of the show’s recent season premieres and finales has been punctuated by a major or   character death (or deaths) and killing off characters to open and close each season is beginning to feel like a routine more than a surprise.     And it’s not just The Walking Dead. Grey’s Anatomy, which I love to death, could have ended after five seasons; it’s currently in its 13th. The Good Wife could have ended with season five; it ran for seven. Glee should have ended when everyone went to college, at the end of season three. True Detective  —   oh, man, remember True Detective? That show would have been better off if it’d never tried to do a season two. Caroline: LOL, True Detective. (Though to your point, it looks like season three is on its way anyway.) To use your (correct) Glee example: I loved the idea of Santana Lopez Takes Manhattan, but when the show left high school, it left a huge part of its heart behind. And that’s kind of the problem with a lot of these shows that drag on beyond their natural expiration dates. They usually end up scrambling to figure out a new story direction and, more often than not, forcing themselves into something that doesn’t fit. Extending a show doesn’t always come down to a creative decision, either. As the number of TV series keeps exploding, networks are less willing to let go of shows that manage to break through and become bona fide hits. If a show has viewers, someone will want to keep it around no matter what. (See: Supernatural going into its 13th season, good god.) And you can really apply that same approach to a whole mess of Hollywood’s current film sequels and reboots, as franchises insist on clinging to audiences as long as those audiences can possibly exist. (See: a fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, coming to a theater near you in May!) Maybe this is why I’ve come to love the recent anthology trend in TV, with shows like American Horror Story, American Crime Story, Feud, and Fargo. Even aside from having the flexibility to grab actors who maybe couldn’t usually commit to five seasons of a TV show, anthology series limit themselves to a single season to tell a story. And when they do use the same casts, every season starts fresh with a new idea. If the result ends up being messy, there’s at least a definite end  —   which used to be a given in storytelling, but not so much anymore.     So, okay, I’ll throw in a caveat: I would take another season of Big Little Lies, but only if it’s the same core cast playing different people in a different location as part of a whole different story.  Alex: Big Little Lies: Highland Park. Caroline: Big Little Lies: Montauk. Big Little Lies: Florida Keys. Basically, just give us a scripted Real Housewives anthology series starring the Big Little Lies cast, and we’ll have ourselves a deal. ",-1.0
"Trump to select Scott Gottlieb, a physician with deep drug-industry ties, to run the FDA.      President Trump is expected to pick Scott Gottlieb, a conservative physician and businessman with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to be commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a person familiar with the nomination said Friday. If confirmed, Gottlieb would bring a strong   deregulatory approach to an agency that Trump has criticized as being overly restrictive. But he is also viewed as someone who would preserve the agency’s basic function: to ensure that drugs are proven to be safe and effective before they are allowed to be sold. His selection would be a victory for the mainstream pharmaceutical industry, which has little appetite for upending the FDA approval process. Even Democratic critics of the industry, and of Gottlieb himself, privately indicated they preferred him to another frequently mentioned contender, Jim O’Neill, an associate of Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump adviser Peter Thiel. In a 2014 speech, O’Neill called for allowing drugs to be marketed after they had been proven safe, but before they had been shown to be effective. O’Neill’s views and Trump’s recent comments that the FDA’s approval process is “slow and burdensome” —   despite data showing that reviews have accelerated  —   caused alarm in some quarters that the agency faced the kind of tectonic changes now affecting the Environmental Protection Agency.   [Trump calls the FDA ”slow,” but it’s faster than ever]   But while Gottlieb, 44, is not seen as someone interested in dismantling the FDA, he is still likely to try shaking it up in significant ways. A former deputy FDA commissioner during the George W. Bush administration, he often has faulted the agency in speeches and opinion columns, saying that its excessive rules have stifled competition, especially because of how generic versions of complex medicines are reviewed. He also has castigated government efforts to go after companies for “  promotion,” which is when manufacturers tout drugs for purposes for which they haven’t been approved. Gottlieb’s industry ties would be closely scrutinized. A partner at the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, he has served as a consultant or adviser to many pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as well as information technology firms that provide software for clinical trials. He is managing director of T. R. Winston & Co. a privately held merchant bank based in Los Angeles that focuses on health care, energy and consumer technology. And he is a member of the product investment board of GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. According to a federal database, Gottlieb received more than $413, 000 in consulting and speaking fees and other payments from pharmaceutical companies between 2013 and 2015. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, described Gottlieb as “entangled in a web of Big Pharma ties” and said his confirmation “would accelerate a   trend in which agency leadership too often makes decisions that are aligned more with the interests of industry than those of patients. ”   [Former FDA head defends importance of drug effectiveness]   But Gottlieb has occasionally taken shots at the industry, especially over high drug prices. In a Forbes column last year, he didn’t mince words about the complicated and secretive system of list prices and rebates that shape drug costs and have led to political and public anger as well as confusion. “As much as the drugmakers complain about the rebating scheme, they’ve grown as dependent on its subterfuge, opacity and inequity as everyone else in the system,” he wrote. John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care and the leader of a group that campaigns against high drug prices, said Gottlieb is “smart and knows the FDA and the issues. ” Gottlieb, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a frequent contributor to the opinion columns of the Wall Street Journal as well as Forbes. Those writings and his speaking appearances shed light on what he might focus on as commissioner. His criticism of FDA restrictions on what manufacturers are permitted to say about   uses of their products goes back years. In 2008, Gottlieb wrote that FDA was pursuing a “rigid standard” and that “doctors should be trusted to properly weigh” various sources of information about drugs. Since then, FDA has eased and clarified some of its positions on   use, but it still asserts that overly permissive policies could result in unproven therapies being pushed to doctors, with potentially dangerous consequences for patients. In recent years, the agency has lost some   lawsuits on the issue on First Amendment grounds. Gottlieb, who is a lymphoma survivor, also has complained that some parts of the agency are too slow in approving new products or new uses for existing drugs. He has praised FDA’s oncology division, which has sped up approvals under the leadership of Richard Pazdur. Ellen Sigal, chairman of Friends of Cancer Research, an advocacy group, said she supported Gottlieb for commissioner. “Throughout his career, Scott has shown a deep understanding of patients’ needs, and as a cancer survivor himself, he will keep them as his north star,” she said. In a 2007   in the Wall Street Journal, he decried a mentality of   in policymaking. In a 2011 piece, he took issue with the agency’s oversight of medical devices, citing an aortic heart valve that had been approved in Europe years earlier. Last year, he returned to that aortic valve  —   criticizing Medicare for limiting access to it. “This episode is a vivid example of the government’s increasing practice to regulate medicine and ration care,” he wrote.

"A field guide to 2017’s diverse slate of Oscar-nominated documentaries.  The five documentaries nominated in the Best Documentary Feature category at the 2017 Oscars are unusually eclectic  —   and unusually urgent. Dealing with topics including race, mass incarceration, autism, and the European migrant crisis, they might all be seen as “issue documentaries,” movies that challenge the viewer to reconfigure the ways they understand the world.    But they’re also all very different, and none of them are totally conventional. Life, Animated, about a family learning to navigate their son’s autism, is the most   documentary, a story told by its subjects. 13th is both fiery and a firehose of information about the US prison system, a damning case and an impassioned plea for change with images that linger after the credits roll.  Fire at Sea, exploring the migrant crisis, takes the exact opposite tack, interspersing scenes from ordinary life with the extraordinary intake of migrants on an Italian island. And both O. J.: Made in America and I Am Not Your Negro trace the history of race in America, but through different means: One is a historical lesson, while the other is virtually a memoir.         Related    Some say Hollywood is out of touch with America. 2017’s Best Picture nominees say otherwise.  That all five are up for the top prize at the Oscars indicates that nonfiction cinema is changing and expanding, with many genres and types of films being considered worthy of recognition. The definition of “documentary” has been expanding for a long time, and that expansion is now becoming mainstream.    And each of the nominated documentaries is worth watching. So here’s a crash course, with some suggestions for further reading.    13th Where to watch it: streaming on Netflix As I said when I first wrote about the film, watching 13th, from Selma director Ava DuVernay, is like standing in the way of a fire hose that’s being slowly cranked up to full blast. You take a little more pressure every moment, until it gets to be staggering, a little bruising. Then you turn around and realize the hose is aimed at a blazing fire. And as you gaze at its destructive heat, the pressure and discomfort you feel pales by contrast. Vital, searing, and engaging, 13th is a primer on the historical context and moral urgency behind a lot of today’s most pressing public issues, from mass incarceration and the war on drugs to police brutality and private prisons, along with an exploration of the motivations behind Black Lives Matter.     The movie’s arguments and implications for policy are a matter of life and death, and yet it’s 13th’s images that stayed with me after watching. I’d seen some of the more iconic and disquieting photos, like the image of Gordon, the slave who’d been whipped so many times that his back, when photographed, was a latticework of scar tissue. In July 1863, the photographs of Gordon were published in Harper’s Weekly, and many who saw it  —   including free black men  —   joined the Union Army as a result. You can be told about the horrors of slavery all you want, but a picture is worth not just a thousand words but, sometimes, a whole library. As a filmmaker, DuVernay knows this. And she puts it to use. Watching 13th, it’s hard to miss the point: If racism depends on skin color first and foremost, then images are the most powerful weapon there is when it comes to shaping public opinion both toward and away from prejudice. So the responsibility for confronting the biases and outright lies that images can perpetrate is on the image makers’ shoulders, especially when the portrayals simply do not line up with actual facts. And, in large part, it’s the image viewers’ responsibility to confront these biases and lies, too.    For more on 13th, read Odie Henderson’s review at RogerEbert. com, or watch DuVernay and Oprah talk about the film in a Netflix special.   Fire at Sea Where to watch it: available in limited theatrical engagements and on iTunes (beginning February 17) Beautifully shot and highly lauded on the festival circuit  —   the film won the prestigious Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016  —   Fire at Sea is a deeply humane exploration of the human cost of the European migrant crisis, and how people live in the midst of it.  And now, in early 2017, it couldn’t be more timely. Over the past few years, hundreds of African and Middle Eastern migrants have arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa every week. In Fire at Sea, documentarian Gianfranco Rosi shows what life looks like for the island’s residents and the rescue crews. The film cuts between scenes of life on the island and the people who help receive and treat migrants.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Fire at Sea is the way it manages to simultaneously be and avoid being a conventional “issue documentary. ” There is certainly an issue at heart here: a humanitarian crisis, and the toll on both the people it affects and the people who take in those who land (or fail to land) on their shores.    But instead of having experts and talking heads tell us what’s happening and why, Rosi asks the audience to attend to the individual faces and experiences of real people, his subjects. His best and most potent weapon comes in how he accomplishes that. We spend a lot of time with one young boy, a resident of the island, and his friends and family. The boy and his pals shoot rocks at cacti with their slingshots and repair them with duct tape. He goes home and eats dinner with his family. We get to know him. And then we see the migrants, pouring into the country, greeted and processed kindly by the residents who work to screen them and help them as best they can. We see bodies of those who didn’t make the voyage and sick people, all with crews trying to rescue them. The sheer scale of the people flooding in juxtaposed with the single young boy underlines the size of the crisis without diminishing the humanity of the migrants by reducing them to statistics. It’s a moving film (and often a funny one) a portrait of life and the people who want to grasp it.  For more on Fire at Sea, read Peter Bradshaw’s review in the Guardian, or director Roberto Minervini’s interview with Rosi in Filmmaker magazine.  I Am Not Your Negro Where to watch it: currently in theaters  The stunning I Am Not Your Negro (which made box office history when it was released in New York) was directed by Raoul Peck. But it was written by writer and social critic James Baldwin  —   who died 30 years ago, in 1987. This isn’t a documentary about James Baldwin, though it certainly is about him. Instead, it gives new life and voice to Baldwin, whose Notes on a Native Son (1955) is a considered a classic work of black American autobiography. (In Toni Morrison’s recommendation for   Coates’s 2015 National Book   Between the World and Me, she compared the two writers.)    All of the film’s narration (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) was written by Baldwin, mostly drawn from letters and notes he made toward a novel called Remember This House that was never published, as well as other books and essays. By pulling together Baldwin’s own words with footage  —   both images he would have known well and clips of Baldwin himself, talking with interviewers, politely tearing them to shreds  —   I Am Not Your Negro creates a document of a country by way of a keen observer and unsparing thinker. It is a cinematic   and a vital, uncomfortable one. The film consists of Jackson’s narration, combined with archival footage and images from old movies and protest videos, so that it grows from monologue to   experience, a trek through Baldwin’s thinking as an observer and participant in America’s rocky 20th century. Peck functions as Baldwin’s partner, or even collaborator, seeing the world through his eyes and helping us do so, too. Baldwin’s work is noted for its intricacy and complexity, and I Am Not Your Negro is no exception. His perspective on race in America both confirms and critiques the men whose lives form the core of his analysis  —   Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.  —   alongside his own.  Baldwin relocated from the US to Paris when he was 24, and lived there on and off for the rest of his life. His   perspective served him well: While certainly active in leftist politics and holding strong views, it’s hard to see him as partisan. Baldwin critiques his friends. He critiques the Black Panthers while also noting the way white people have pathologized blacks to make up for their own anxieties. If you’re watching I Am Not Your Negro and not feeling uncomfortable, you’re doing it wrong.  For more on I Am Not Your Negro, check out A. O. Scott’s review in the New York Times or listen to an interview with Peck on FilmLinc’s podcast, The  .  Life, Animated Where to watch it: streaming on Amazon Prime Life, Animated is the most conventional of the documentaries nominated for an Oscar this year  —   the story of how one young man and his family learned to navigate his autism.     The young man is Owen Suskind, whose father, Ron  —   a   journalist  —   wrote the book on which the documentary is based. Around age 3, Owen suddenly went from being a peppy and bubbly child to being totally noncommunicative, seemingly locked inside his own world. This was the 1980s and ’90s, when autism wasn’t as well understood as it is today. The family  —   parents Ron and Cornelia and brother Walter  —   tell their often heartbreaking story of searching for answers and, eventually, finding a way to help Owen through his difficulties with communication and navigating the world. It turned out that even though Owen was largely disconnected from his surroundings, he gravitated toward Disney animated films, and those films gave him a way to communicate with his family. The characters and their lines of dialogue gave the family a bridge to talk to Owen, who learned to understand emotion and conversation through what he saw in the movies. Owen is in his 20s now, and the film also follows him as he adjusts to living   for the first time, in a community with resources and assistance. He tells us about his experiences, and about how he gradually reconnected with the world. We watch him interact with friends, family, and girlfriend, and learn to live on his own. The result is a joyful portrait of a family who found their way back together through Disney movies. But even more, it’s a glimpse into ways that autistic individuals are able to participate in society in ways they haven’t always been in the past. As such, it’s also an advocacy documentary: Autistic people are people just like anybody else  —   they just communicate in different ways. Ultimately, the film tells a sweet and uplifting story while also offering some ways forward. For more on Life, Animated, read Justin Chang’s review in Variety and read an interview with the film’s director, Roger Ross Williams, in Indiewire.     O. J.: Made in America Where to watch it: streaming on Hulu and WatchESPN; digital rental on Amazon That a   documentary with an almost   runtime is nominated for an Oscar seems remarkable enough. That its focus is the    O. J. Simpson trial feels even more amazing  —   haven’t people had enough? (Especially since the   FX miniseries The People vs. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story garnered accolades at the same time.)  Yes, it’s that good. Vox’s own Todd VanDerWerff described its mastery this way:  O. J.: Made in America might be the most essential TV series of the year. The   ESPN documentary is a rich, dense examination of more than 50 years of American culture, one that uses the O. J. Simpson murder trial as a way to look at race and gender and class  …       …    Made in America turns the trial into just a smaller part of its overall tapestry. (Indeed, the murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman and Simpson’s subsequent trial fill just two of the documentary’s five episodes.) It’s focused on context and on Simpson himself, on the nation that could build up such a figure and then tear him down. It’s also big and sprawling, and it embraces all the contradictions inherent in its story, finding ways to navigate them while simultaneously forcing you to confront how they reflect the deeply unjust core problems of American society. It’s patient, with a brilliant eye for how to use talking head interviews and archival footage to tell a larger story. And right in the center is an argument that might make you a little queasy, thanks to how Made in America forces you to keep turning it over and over in your head.  “Made in America understands that simply by existing as a black man in America, Simpson was a spokesperson anyway, no matter how he ran from it,” VanDerWerff wrote, and that’s exactly right: The project, directed by Ezra Edelman, feels remarkably timely, unpacking many of the prejudices and assumptions that are still animating public life today. It’s also just riveting to watch, with archival footage, discussions, and a sweeping history of everything that led to the trial, and everything after. (Some rarely seen footage of Simpson in prison is especially startling.) O. J.: Made in America is less the history of O. J. Simpson and more a biting indictment of the country that gave rise to his case, which feels almost inevitable.     For more on O. J.: Made in America, read Vox’s full review or Brian Tallerico’s review at RogerEbert. com, and listen to an interview with director Ezra Edelman on KCRW’s The Business.  ",-1.0
"This $143 billion deal could bring together the makers of Velveeta and Vaseline.  Kraft Heinz, the maker of Velveeta,   and Grey Poupon, on Friday said it had made an offer to buy Unilever for $143 billion in what could be the largest food and beverage deal of all time. Unilever, however, said it isn’t interested in the $   deal, which represented an 18 percent premium on Thursday’s share price. The   company, which has 400 brands including Hellman’s, Ben & Jerry’s and Vaseline, said it “rejected the proposal as it sees no merit, either financial or strategic, for Unilever’s shareholders. ” “Unilever,” the company added, “does not see the basis for any further discussions. ” But    Kraft says it isn’t taking no for an answer, and analysts say it is likely that the company will sweeten its    offer as it looks to Unilever to help expand its international reach. Kraft said in a statement that it is “working to reach agreement on the terms of a transaction. ”  If the two   giants were to reach a deal, it would bring together hundreds of iconic brands, including Lunchables and Lipton, and Maxwell House and Marmite. The combined company would have annual sales of nearly $85 billion a year, just behind  Nestle’s 2016 revenue of about $89 billion. The purchase would also help U. S.  Kraft Heinz tap into European and Asian markets, which make up about 70 percent of Unilever’s annual revenue, and would help it expand beyond food and drink products. “Geographically speaking, these two companies are very complementary,” said Paul Hickman, an analyst at Edison Investment Research in London. “You can see how putting them together would make sense. ”   companies have been under pressure to consolidate in recent years amid slowing growth, increased competition and heightened demand for   foods. Still, analysts said they were surprised by the offer. Kraft Heinz is in the midst of cutting costs following the   deal that brought  together the J. Heinz Co. with Kraft Foods in 2015. Today, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital own about 51 percent of Kraft Heinz. Buffett sits on the company’s board. “For me, the deal makes no sense,” said Michael Hewson, chief analyst for CMC Markets in London. “Kraft could get a very big dose of indigestion if they decided to pony up for this one. ”  [Nestlé to move U. S. headquarters to Arlington, bringing 750 jobs]  For one, he said, Unilever  —   with about $58. 7 billion in annual revenue and 168, 000 employees  —   is larger than Kraft Heinz, which has $26. 49 billion in annual revenue and 42, 000 employees. Also, the merger of two of the world’s largest   companies could raise concerns among antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe, Hew son said. And, he added, Unilever shareholders could be wary of the deal. “Look at the way Unilever has performed over the last 20 years: Steady income growth  —   through recessions, through booms,” he said. “I’m not convinced   Unilever investors would want to pass that up. ” But the markets have reacted favorably to the prospect of a Kraft Heinz takeover of Unilever. Shares of Unilever rose 15. 3 percent to close at an   high of $48. 79 Friday following the announcement, while Kraft Heinz’s stock was up about 11 percent. “Kraft Heinz has a very strong track record of acquisitions and being able to cut costs and create value by doing that,” said Brittany Weissman, an analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis. “While Unilever might not be exactly what people were expecting, Kraft Heinz would still be able to find tremendous value in an acquisition like this. ” Hewson, though, said that Unilever shareholders may look to Cadbury, which Kraft bought in 2010, as a cautionary tale.  Kraft Foods had originally swooped in with a $16. 2 billion takeover offer, which the British candymaker “emphatically rejected. ” “Kraft’s offer does not come remotely close to reflecting the true value of our company, and involves the unattractive prospect of the absorption of Cadbury into a   conglomerate business model,” Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr was quoted saying at the time.  [This beloved grocery chain is the latest company to face   boycotts]  But three months later, the two companies had reached a deal. Kraft acquired Cadbury for $18. 9 billion, and soon after shuttered a longtime British factory that it had promised to keep open. (Cadbury is now part of Mondelez International, following a 2012 spinoff of Kraft’s confectionary business.) “Kraft Heinz is a bit of a corporate raider,” Hewson said. “There’s still a nasty aftertaste in the mouth after what happened with Cadbury in 2010. ” On Thursday, Kraft Heinz reported a 44 percent increase in annual revenue, which rose to $26. 5 billion in 2016. The company also reported a profit of $3. 64 billion for the year. A few weeks earlier, Kraft Heinz had announced that it would be partnering with Oprah Winfrey to create a line of    refrigerated meals as it looks to add more fresh fare and nutritious foods to its lineup. With Unilever, the company could grow further by making the transition to household and personal goods such as   Dove and Axe. Analysts said they expected Kraft Heinz to ratchet up its offer for the company. Erin Lash, an analyst for Morningstar in Chicago, said Kraft would likely have to offer $165 billion to $175 billion to successfully woo Unilever.  The takeover bid follows in the footsteps of   InBev SA’s $123 billion purchase of competitor SAB Miller Plc, which was completed in October. “This is already a large deal,” Weissman said, “and it’s likely to get even larger. ” “This is clearly just the first roll of dice for Kraft,” Hickman said. “My sense is that this will run and run. ”  Read more:   French manicures, Bud Light and fly fishing: How Trump staffers are changing Washington   Student debt now affects a staggering number of elderly Americans   Facebook wants to help you find a job  —   even if you’re not looking for one     ",-0.5
"Canada’s new assisted suicide law is trying to prevent “suicide tourism”.  Canada’s law legalizing   suicide  —   which allows doctors to help terminally ill patients end their own lives  —   will only apply to people who live in Canada, according to the Associated Press. That means terminally ill Americans who live in one of the majority of American states that doesn’t allow   suicide won’t be able to travel to Canada to end their lives.    When Canada’s Supreme Court legalized assisted suicide for patients who have a ”grievous and irremediable medical condition,” it led to speculation that the country would become a destination for people from elsewhere looking for aid in dying comfortably.   Related 1 in 6 Americans lives in a state where assisted suicide is legal   That’s what happened in Switzerland, one of four European countries with assisted suicide, even for patients who are not terminally ill. One study found that more than 600 people traveled to Switzerland between 2008 and 2012 in order to use the country’s    laws. By limiting aid in dying to Canadian residents, the Canadian laws, which are scheduled to be announced Thursday, make it much less likely that the country will get an influx of ”suicide tourism.” And the spread of    laws in the US means they might not need to. After California legalized   suicide in October, one in six Americans now lives in a state where it’s legal for doctors to help terminally ill patients end their own lives.    More details on Canada’s law will be released later today, including whether it will apply to people suffering psychologically as well as physically, to children, and to people who are not terminally ill, as a parliamentary panel recommended in February. Go deeper:  One of the most moving stories I’ve read about the right to die comes from Robin Marantz Henig in the New York Times magazine about Sandy Bem, a psychology professor at Cornell with Alzheimer’s who chose the day she would end her own life, and the way her family came to terms with that fact. (Even in states with    laws, dementia is usually excluded.) At Mother Jones, Kevin Drum, whose    ended his life while dying of bone cancer, writes about fighting the disease himself, weighing whether he should take his own life if it progresses. When California legalized   suicide, Vox’s Sarah Kliff wrote a primer on how it works  —   including the fact that   of people who seek out drugs to kill themselves will never end up using them.

"Texas teacher who had sex almost daily with 13-year-old student gets 10 years in prison.          A former Texas   teacher who was impregnated by a    student has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Alexandria Vera, 25, was facing up to 30 years behind bars after pleading guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child in November. She admitted to police that a relationship that started with Instagram messages between her and the boy blossomed into a romance  —   one that the boy’s family approved of. A judge in the 209th District Court in Houston said during Vera’s sentencing hearing on Friday that he does not believe the former English teacher is a danger to children or a classic pedophile, the Houston Chronicle reported. But Judge Michael McSpadden said he wants to send a message to the community by giving Vera some prison time. “We want our educators to teach our students,” McSpadden said, according to the Houston Chronicle. ” We want them to keep their hands off students. ”   [Texas teacher who had sex almost daily with    student could face decades in prison]     Alexandria Vera, former teacher impregnated by    student, sentenced to 10 years in prison https:  .  #houNews  —   brian rogers (@brianjrogers) January 13, 2017   Vera, an   teacher at Stovall Middle School in Houston, was arrested in June and initially charged with continuous sexual assault of a child, which carries a maximum of life imprisonment. Her sentence was capped at 30 years after she pleaded guilty. Vera told police that she met the boy during summer school in 2015. She said she initially resisted the boy’s advances until sometime last fall, when she agreed to hang out with her student. Prosecutors say Vera and the teen had sex almost every day for nine months. She told investigators that they love each other, according to court documents. During the relationship, Vera told her neighbors that the boy was her brother, according to KHOU, a CBS affiliate. Prosecutors say Vera groomed the child and his family, even moving the teen and his father into her home and pretending she was dating the father, the Houston Chronicle reported. She also bought groceries for the boy’s family and paid the phone bills.   [A teacher and his husband were found dead in August. Police say they had sexually abused 8 boys.]     Former teacher sentenced for aggravated sexual  …     https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   FOX26Houston (@Fox26Houston) January 14, 2017   “She has a history of   deception,” Denise Nichols, a Harris County prosecutor, said in court. Vera’s    daughter knew about the relationship, even called the    “dad,” Nichols said. A mental health professional who works with sex offenders testified on Vera’s behalf. Karen Lawson said Vera grew up around domestic violence. She described the former teacher as someone with a “big heart” and a need to be loved, the Houston Chronicle reported. “I think she was driven by being in love with him,” Lawson testified in court, according to the Houston Chronicle. The investigation began after the school principal received a tip about Vera in early 2016. Vera told police she had gotten pregnant and had an abortion after Child Protective Services questioned her about the relationship in February, according to   an ABC affiliate. Vera probably will not spend her entire sentence in prison. She’ll be eligible for parole in five years, the Dallas Morning News reported.

"Donald Trump’s vulgar comments from 2005 could haunt him until Election Day.  Donald Trump made some ugly comments about women in 2005, and they might haunt him for the next 31 days.     The Washington Post published a secretly recorded video that captures Trump talking about what you can do to women if you’re a famous man: They let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the pussy . .. I did try and fuck her. She was married. I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.   …     I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there and she was married.

There’s just two days until the   second presidential debate, and there’s little doubt that this story will stay on the airwaves until then. However Trump responds to questions about the video at the debate will also probably dominate the headlines for days. And with just 31 days left in the campaign, Trump is already trailing in the polls by 4 or 5 points. Trump needed some new Clinton scandal or “October surprise” to have a chance of clawing his way back into the race. Instead, he’ll be trying to explain why “grab ’em by the pussy” is an okay thing for the future leader of America to say.    ",-1.0

"Why the Fed needs to prepare for the worst right now.    The writer is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Obama from 2009 through 2010   Often markets are volatile at the end of the year  —   as many traders go on holiday and those with losses unload them  —   and then settle down as a new year begins. Not this year. U. S. and European markets closed significantly lower on Friday after a very rough week despite a very strong U. S. jobs report. The week’s economic news was dominated by dramatic declines in China’s stock market and currency; the week also saw a further plunge in oil prices even in the face of major tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A week when bad market news repeatedly makes the front page raises the general question of how much forecasters and policymakers should look to speculative markets as indicators regarding future prospects. And it raises the more specific question of how alarmed policymakers should be about the prospect of a global slowdown, especially in light of the financial dramas playing out in China.  There is little question that markets are highly volatile relative to the fundamentals they seek to assess. Economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped 50 years ago, “the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions. ” Former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin was right when he would regularly reassure anxious politicos in the Clinton White House that “markets go up, and markets go down” on days when a market move created either joy or anxiety. The best executives manage their company with an eye to   profitability, not daily stock price. And policymakers do best when they concentrate on strengthening economic fundamentals rather than on daily market fluctuations. At the same time, because markets aggregate the views of a huge number of participants, and because they are constantly assessing the future (unlike economic statistics, which only reflect the past) they are like canaries in coal mines: very valuable in giving warning when conditions change. That is why several studies have shown that prediction markets do a better job of forecasting elections than pollsters and why Hollywood studios use such markets to judge the likely success of movies.   An investor views stock market data at a securities brokerage house in Beijing on Jan. 8. (Rolex Dela   Pressphoto Agency)  Policymakers who dismiss market moves as reflecting mere speculation often make a serious mistake. Markets were on to the gravity of the 2008 crisis well before the Federal Reserve was; to the unsustainability of fixed exchange rates in Britain, Mexico and Brazil while the authorities were still in denial; and to the onset of a slowdown or recession well before forecasters in countless downturns. While markets do sometimes send false alarms and should not be slavishly followed, the conventional wisdom essentially never recognizes gathering storms. The Economist reports this week that, looking across all major countries over the past several decades, there were 220 instances in which a year of positive growth was followed by one of contraction. In its April forecasts during the growth year, the International Monetary Fund did not anticipate a coming recession on a single occasion!  Market signals should be taken especially seriously when they are   and coming from many markets, as is the case with current indications that inflation will not reach target levels within a decade in the United States, Europe or Japan. Especially ominous are moments when news fails to rally markets as would be expected such as with the U. S. stock market and Friday’s strong employment report or the decline of oil prices in the face of heightened Middle East tensions.  Last week we saw huge negative movements in Chinese markets and a large foreign market response. While it certainly could be the case that the Chinese developments reflect a combination of market psychology and clumsy policy responses, and that the strong response of world markets is an example of transient contagion, I doubt it. Over the past year, about 20 percent of China’s growth as reported in its official statistics has come from its   sector, which has mushroomed to the point where it is about as large relative to national GDP as in Britain, and Chinese debt levels are extraordinarily high. This is hardly a case of healthy or sustainable growth.  In recent years, China’s growth has come heavily from massive infrastructure investment; indeed, China put in place more cement and concrete between 2011 and 2013 than the United States did in the whole of the 20th century. This growth, too, is unsustainable, and even if it is replaced by domestic services, China’s contribution to demand for global commodities will fall way off.  Experience suggests that the best indicators of a country’s economic prospects are the decisions that its citizens make about keeping capital at home or exporting it abroad. The reason the renminbi is under pressure is that Chinese citizens are extremely eager to move their money overseas. But for the substantial recent depletion of China’s reserves, the renminbi would already have substantially depreciated.  Traditionally, international developments have had only a limited impact on the U. S. and European economies because their impact could be offset by monetary policy actions. Thus, the U. S. economy grew robustly through the Asian financial crisis as the Fed brought interest rates down. With rates essentially at zero in the industrial countries, however, this option is no longer available, and foreign economic problems are likely to have much more direct effects on economic performance. Because of China’s scale, its potential volatility and the limited room for conventional monetary maneuvers, the global risk to domestic economic performance in the United States, Europe and many emerging markets is as great as any time I can remember. It is time for policymakers to hope for the best and plan for the worst.   Read more on this topic:   Lawrence Summers: The global economy is in serious danger   Robert J.

"Best Sonos Setup: Which Speakers, Soundbars Should You Buy?. Here at WIRED, we like Sonos speakers. We really do. Throughout the past eight years, we’ve reviewed all of the company's wirelessly connectable speakers, from its small Play:1 to its Beam soundbar, and we've recommended every one of them. But it’s not cheap to turn your home into a Sonos-powered shrine to sound. Like Apple products, Sonos speakers sell at a premium, starting at $100 for a basic bookshelf speaker. But which ones should you buy? Read on for my recommendations. Updated August 2019: We've added in the new Sonos/Ikea Symfonisk speakers, which were added to our picks, and updated with info about Google Assistant support, which finally arrived after several delays. When you buy something using the retail links in our buying guides, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Read more about how this works. Sonos One The Sonos One (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is just about the smallest Sonos speaker, but it still packs enough oomph to fill most rooms and its hands-free Alexa and Google Assistant integration is a lot of fun. Sonos took the time to make Alexa sound great, and thanks to its voice commands, the Sonos One has become my go-to speaker. Alexa and Google voice commands work like normal (though you must choose between them). It can play music, tell you the weather, find a recipe, and answer simple questions, like any other smart speaker. It also works with Siri via AirPlay 2. I'll recommend other Sonos speakers in this guide, but you also can’t go wrong just buying two to four Sonos Ones to fill your house up. You get a small discount on orders of two or more. They’re much more affordable and their small size means you can hide them in any room. Buy the Sonos One for $199 at Amazon and Sonos.com Play:1 is a Good Alternative: The Play:1 is $150 at Amazon and Sonos.com. It sounds about as good as the Sonos One, but doesn't have touch controls or microphones for Alexa. If you already own a One, it's a good way to add more satellite speakers to your home. Sonos and Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker With the Symfonisk bookshelf speaker, the entry price for a Sonos speaker has dropped by $50. If you want to network a few speakers together for a larger room, or connected rooms, it's the cheapest way to do it. Sonos collaborated with Ikea on this one, which is why it's more affordable and slightly less pristine than the others in this guide. It's been a while since a Sonos speaker had physical buttons, for one. Looks aside, it sounds almost as good as a Sonos One. You can mount it right to your wall or stand it upright on a bookshelf or table. It doesn't directly take audio commands because it has no mic, so you'll need a Sonos One, Google speaker, or Alexa speaker that you can yell at if you want to control it with your voice. Other than that, it does everything you'd want a Sonos to do. The Sonos Symfonisk table lamp costs $180 and also sounds great; if you like its style, go for it. Read our dual review to see what they both look like. Buy the Sonos/Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker for $100 at Ikea Sonos Play:5 If you really like to party, I recommend adding a Sonos Play:5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to your setup. It has enough kick to dial a party up to 11, or just really annoy your neighbors. I placed mine in the largest room of my apartment and it was honestly more power than I needed. Sonos boasts that this model has six Class-D digital amplifiers: three tweeters, three mid-woofers, and a phased speaker array. In practical terms, it will fill a very large room or basement with ease. Out of the four standard Sonos speakers I tested, this one delivered the largest range of sound, with enough thump to satisfy fans of any genre. It's worth noting that it does not have microphones, so it cannot be used hands-free with Alexa or Google Assistant. Buy the Play:5 for $499 at Amazon or Sonos.com Sonos Beam The Beam (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of three soundbars that Sonos offers. It doesn't sound quite as expansive as the older, larger Playbar, but it is more precise in the upper range and sounds fantastic overall. Its smaller size and extra features are worth the size tradeoff. It's $300 cheaper, too. Unlike the Playbar, it can connect to your TV via HDMI ARC, letting you turn your tube on and off with your own voice. It has Alexa, Google Assistant, and Airplay 2 built-in. Even if you don't particularly need a voice assistant today, you may change your tune in a few years. If you own a Fire TV Stick (our TV streaming device guide), it's also possible to use basic Alexa commands on the Beam to watch any TV show or movie, though no voice assistant works well enough to replace a remote control yet. Buy the Sonos Beam for $399 at Amazon or Sonos.com Save Up for the Subwoofer: Sonos hasn't yet released a more affordable Sub to match the cheaper Beam. The standard Sub is superb, but it will cost you $699 on Sonos or Amazon. Don't bother buying surround speakers until you own a Sub. It will make a more profound difference. Sonos Playbar A soundbar can make all the difference in a home theater, and costs a lot less than a full surround sound setup. The Sonos Beam is great for apartments, but if you really want a powerful soundbar, the Sonos Playbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still the best. With more mid-woofers, it delivers deep bass and has more balance and depth than the Beam or Playbase. It's also built to hang on a wall, but at just over 3-inches tall and 5-inches thick, it can sit in front of most TVs without hassle. If you plan to spend the extra money to buy the Playbar, try to save up $699 more to get a Sonos Sub. It's the second best investment you can make to improve your home theater experience. Buy the Playbar for $699 at Amazon or Sonos.com Playbase is Good for Pedestal TVs: The Playbase (Playbase sounds a little sharper than the Playbar on high treble sounds, like cymbals, but it's still one of the best soundbars you can buy. It's made to sit under your TV and costs $699 at Amazon or Sonos.com. Sonos Beam, Sub, and 2 Play:1s To enable surround sound with one of its soundbars, Sonos requires two rear speakers, one for the left and one for the right. You can use any two speakers, as long as they're identical. I’ve used two Play:5 speakers, but it’s overkill. Two Sonos One speakers are a better match, but if you are getting a Beam, it has mics in it, so save $100 and get two Play:1 speakers. They sound just as good. You can save another $100 if you buy two Sonos/Ikea Symfonisk speakers, which also sound outstanding. This is one of the easiest wireless surround sound systems to set up. Simply place the speakers you choose to the left and right of your couch, then open up the Sonos app, add a surround speaker, and follow the instructions while the software does the rest. They don’t add as much benefit as you get from a Beam and Sub combo, but if you watch a lot of movies and want to hear things like TIE Fighters flying over your head in Star Wars, you’ll like the extra surround. Sonos sells Sanus Speaker Stands for $100 and Wall Mounts for $60. I have not tested these, but do not see any major red flags. More accessories are listed below. Buy the Beam Sub 3.1 bundle for $1,098 at Amazon (or Sonos.com) and 2 Symfonisk speakers for $200 at Ikea Not Near an Ikea? Try These Bundles: this Beam 5.1 Surround bundle costs $1,299 at Amazon (Sonos.com) and comes with a Sub and two Play:1s. I recommend it highly. If your room is large, this Playbar 5.1 Surround bundle for $1,678 at Amazon (Sonos.com) sounds phenomenal. Sonos released a few new accessories in 2019. The company has worked with Sanus on stands before, but it now sells a shelf and stands for its smaller speakers. You can also buy them bundled with the Play:1 or Sonos One. Sonos Shelf for $60 at Amazon or Sonos.com: This shelf is reversible so you can place a Sonos One or Play:1 on the left or right. It has an indent so the speaker fits right in, and it hides the cord and directs it through the bottom. Be sure to check out the new Sonos/Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker before you buy, though. It's more affordable and can hook right to the wall and act as a shelf itself. 2 Sonos Stands for $250 at Amazon or Sonos.com: If you plan to use a pair of Play:1 or Sonos One speakers for surround sound, but don't have adequate shelving near your couch, the official Sonos stands are a good option. Sonos also supports these cheaper stands by Sanus. Longer (or Shorter) Power Cables at Sonos.com: Depending on your outlet situation, you may need a longer cord and Sonos now sells them. Sonos also sells cords at Amazon, but it's much easier to choose your specific product and length on the official Sonos site. Other Supported Accessories at Amazon or Sonos.com: Sonos sells variety of niche accessories that may help you out, depending on your setup. After flooding my home with every Sonos model you can buy (and filling all remaining space with the boxes of said speakers), I’ve come to value their audio fidelity and ability to seamlessly network together. Here are my favorite aspects of Sonos: Simple Setup: It’s incredibly easy to set up these speakers. The Sonos app guides you through the process of starting a new system, or adding speakers to an existing system. There isn’t another speaker system that lets you string together multiple speakers as easily, or connect them up to stream in different rooms of your home while keeping the audio perfectly in sync. Easy Streaming: The Sonos app supports almost every streaming service in existence, and many apps, like Spotify, let you stream to Sonos speakers within them. The Sonos ecosystem can also handle home theater applications, and can support a full surround sound setup. All Major Voice Assistants: Unlike most ""smart"" speakers, Sonos speakers will connect to any one of the big three voice assistants: Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Airplay 2. You do have to choose one assistant at a time, but they're fully functional, with the exception of some phone calling functionality through Alexa. They Sound Amazing: Sonos speakers are all high quality and deliver consistent, appealing sound. It’s easy to argue that Sonos hardware is too expensive, but it's difficult to fault the way they sound. Not every Sonos speaker is the same, but they have an elegant synergy and sound that no other speaker system seems to have. If you have a few speakers in a room, it’s hard to tell where the sound is coming from. The crystal clear music engulfs you. Spotify Voice Controls: Spotify can now be accessed using Alexa or Google Assistant voice control on the Sonos One and Sonos Beam. If you have one of these speakers, you can set Spotify as your default music service. Then, when you ask Alexa or Google to play something, it plays it directly from Spotify. (Of course, you can set any available music service as your default: Amazon, YouTube Music, and so on.) As amazing as Sonos speakers sound, and as seamlessly as they connect together, they still have some limitations, both in application and technology. We don’t think these are dealbreakers (yet), but you might. Aging Connectivity: The tweeters and woofers inside Sonos speakers still sound amazing, but the way they connect to your network (or TV) is dated. Sonos speakers only have 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g, which means that they cannot connect on the sometimes faster/cleaner 5 GHz frequency commonly used today (though some of them do use 5 GHz to communicate with each other). I have yet to notice loss in fidelity or have dropouts on a Sonos, but the lack of support for today's Wi-Fi standards, including N/AC, may eventually haunt these speakers. If you do have issues, the best solution is to connect one of your Sonos speakers directly via ethernet. It will share its faster connection with the others. Sonos’ soundbars (except the Beam) also rely on optical cables, lacking modern ports like HDMI, and newer standards like Dolby Atmos. They do still sound amazing, though. No Batteries or Bluetooth: None of the speakers have battery power or Bluetooth, so you cannot use them outside of your home. You can unplug and move them from room to room, but it's not exactly encouraged—the app has you tune their sound to each space and give them names like ""Kitchen."" You Must Use the Sonos App (mostly): Sonos has done an admirable job updating its speakers with new features through its app, but the app is still the only way to listen to some sources of music. Sonos is slowly freeing services from its app, allowing you to directly broadcast to any speaker within the normal Spotify, Tidal, Audible, and Pandora apps, for instance. For others, you’re still stuck using the Sonos app, which functions fine, but isn’t ideal.

"Royal Jordanian Airlines is brilliantly trolling United over the passenger dragging scandal.  United Airlines is in the midst of a scandal over a viral video of a passenger being forcibly dragged off one of its flights by police officers for refusing to give up his seat on an overbooked flight, and its atrocious public relations response that followed.     But another airline is having a field day with it. Royal Jordanian Airlines promptly sent out a series of tweets brilliantly trolling United for the debacle and ensuring customers that they will not be violently removed from Royal Jordanian flights.

Royal Jordanian was the first to announce the new policy when it  —   perhaps mistakenly  —   sent out a   tweet announcing the ban to its customers, before the Trump administration had had a chance to announce it themselves.

Saturday’s Final Four will whittle the field to two, and Monday night, we will have a national champion. Will it be tournament darling South Carolina? Gritty Gonzaga? The persistent Oregon Ducks? Or reliable North Carolina? Below, we’ve put together all the information you need for this weekend, and stay tuned  —   this story will update with all the latest and greatest from the Final Four. Game previews with schedule and times Both games will be televised on CBS. All times ET. Point spreads taken Thursday from the consensus odds at VegasInsider. com. Gonzaga ( . 5) vs. South Carolina Time: 6:09 p. m. In 2009, the last time NCAA tournament games were played at cavernous University of Phoenix Stadium, the teams combined to shoot just 27 percent (25 of 92) on   over three West Region semifinal and final games.   eight years, and Gonzaga and South Carolina have been two of the stingiest teams in the country when it comes to allowing  . The Bulldogs rank fourth nationally in   defense at 29. 3 percent while the Gamecocks rank eighth at 30. 1 percent. In other words, it could be a long night from long range for both teams, neither of whom are known to be particularly strong   artists. Another reason to think points might be in short supply: Gonzaga ranks first nationally in Ken Pomeroy’s defensive efficiency metric, allowing 86 points per 100 possessions, while South Carolina ranks second (87. 8). North Carolina ( ) vs. Oregon Time: Approx. 8:49 p. m.   also could come into play in Saturday’s second national semifinal: Of the four teams remaining, Oregon has both taken the most   in the NCAA tournament (81) and made the highest percentage of them (43. 2 percent, up from their regular season average of 39. 2). North Carolina, meanwhile, has seen the biggest drop in   percentage out of the four remaining teams: The Tar Heels are shooting just 32. 1 percent from   range in the tournament, down from 36. 6 percent in the regular season (they made just 3 of 15 attempts in their Elite Eight win over Kentucky). Oregon’s opponents are shooting just 31. 1 percent from   range this season (16th nationally). North Carolina holds the obvious edge in   experience, as the Tar Heels played for the national title last season and it’s the ninth Final Four for Coach Roy Williams, but don’t discount an Oregon program that’s played in 15 NCAA tournament games over the past five seasons.  —  Matt Bonesteel Everything you need to know    Just call him Frank. (Mark   Press)  >> There are only three games left this college basketball season, and thus the last chances to make picks against the spread. The Post’s Matt Bonesteel, who is seven games up so far in March Madness, makes his picks for Saturday’s semifinals. >>The   Carolina national semifinal presents something of a 21st century anomaly: It could hinge largely on big men who like being big men. In some way, they’re throwbacks to last century, when big men gathered under the basket, hung around and refrained from straying toward the perimeter in a wish to commit art. >> North Carolina has been set as the biggest favorite of any team entering the Final Four since Louisville in 2013, when the Cardinals went on to win it all. There’s good reason for the short odds: The Tar Heels are the best team left in the tournament. >> University of Phoenix Stadium is hosting the Final Four for the first time, and if its brief history as a football stadium is any indication, we could be in for some crazy games. Maybe it’s something in the soil, as one former Arizona Cardinals coach who by strange coincidence grew up farming the land that became the stadium, has some perspective on. >> The snarling,   Bulldog of Gonzaga appeared Thursday at its first Final Four, plastered on the facade of University of Phoenix Stadium, gigantic in its vividness. The logo of a small Catholic school from Spokane, having long ago become a ubiquitous presence in the upper echelon of college basketball, had made it to the side of a spaceship in the American desert. >> And speaking of the origins of the Gonzaga men’s basketball program, we can’t forget about Dan Monson. As Adam Kilgore writes: In real life, there is no going back. Monson knows that well, and he is at complete peace with it. Even this week, as people perpetually ask him, “Why did you leave Gonzaga?” Especially this week, as he cherishes the opportunity to reminisce. At another assembly of former coaches and players earlier this week, Gonzaga Athletic Director Mike Roth shook his hand and told him, “Dan, thanks for starting this. ” >> It’s hard to call South Carolina a Cinderella considering its place in the Southeastern Conference. But in terms of   programs, the Gamecocks’ run to the Final Four after decades in the college basketball wilderness is about as Cinderella as it gets: This year’s NCAA tournament berth is just their fourth over the last 43 seasons. Why has it been such a struggle for such a large public university  —   a member of the   SEC and one that has a relatively new arena (opened in 2002)   —   to field a consistently competitive basketball team? >> Nigel   has been about as close to perfect as a realistic coach could hope, even if he just spent four NCAA tournament games entering Saturday’s national semifinal against South Carolina shooting 31. 1 percent. That’s because the Gonzaga floor general, one of five finalists for the Wooden Award, is a     type even among     types, so that box scores both tell and hide his effects. >> South Carolina reached its first Sweet 16 of the     era, their first Elite Eight ever and their first Final Four ever, and nobody knows anything. They have beaten the frightening and clearly Final   No. 2 seed Duke, the leftover favorite No. 3 seed Baylor; and the     No. 4 seed Florida, to which they lost by 15 points 33 days prior. And they have done so even without the normal palpitations. >> South Carolina already vanquished No. 2 Duke, held No. 3 Baylor to 50 points and forced 16 turnovers from No. 4 Florida. But the Gamecocks have to be even better against Gonzaga if they hope to make it past the Final Four. The one weakness South Carolina has to exploit? Gonzaga’s (relatively) weak   shooting.  >> Any discussion of an Oregon upset must start with defensive rebounding. North Carolina is the best rebounding team in the nation, grabbing 41. 9 percent of its misses off the offensive glass. >> For fans of the South Carolina men’s basketball team, a trip to the Final Four for the first time in school history would be unthinkable without “Gamecock Jesus. ” The team’s uberfan has the funds to get to Phoenix courtesy of a GoFundMe drive that raised nearly $5, 000, almost $1, 500 more than its goal, to cover airfare and tickets. >> Heading into the NCAA tournament, South Carolina held opponents to 88. 7 points per 100 possessions after adjusting for strength of schedule, the   defensive effort in the nation. If their defense can hold up, the Gamecocks will play for a national title. And more    The shot of the tournament  —   so far. (Justin   TODAY Sports)  >> North Carolina arrives in Greater Phoenix this weekend lonely in two feats. The Tar Heels are the only team reappearing in the Final Four for a consecutive season, and that might not be their most impressive deed. In a climate of rampant player movement, they have not seen a player transfer out since Larry Drew II in February 2011, which might as well be a lifetime of seasons ago. Only two other teams in this NCAA tournament  —   Maryland and Princeton  —   had not experienced a player transferring in the past two offseasons, according to data USA Today compiled. Just three other schools  —   Temple, Furman and William & Mary  —   belonged to that group in all of Division I. >> Opposition from the NCAA was seen as a main impetus for North Carolina to repeal the controversial HB2, or “bathroom bill,” which they reached an agreement to do Wednesday night. Citing the discriminatory nature of the law, the NCAA moved seven championship events out of the state this academic year, including   men’s basketball tournament games that were moved from Greensboro, N. C. to Greenville, S. C. Will this move be enough to satisfy the NCAA? >> During Frank Martin’s first collegiate coaching job, reporters often noted that his Kansas State players didn’t call him coach, but rather addressed him by his first name. But Martin in his 50s now, the coach of South Carolina, a Final Four team. And yet  —   as reporters noticed last weekend  —   his players still call him just plain old Frank.  >> Need an alphabetical guide to this Final Four weekend?

"That’s 4 straight debates without a single question on climate change. Good job, everyone..  It finally happened. After three straight debates without a single moderator asking about climate change, Fox News’s Chris Wallace decided to focus the final presidential showdown on a   issue that would greatly affect future generations. He wasn’t going to let Trump or Clinton avoid the topic, either. He pulled out facts and figures and demanded to know why the two candidates were ignoring the problem.    Wait, sorry, I’m just kidding. Wallace didn’t ask about climate change at all. He wanted to talk about the national debt.  The national debt is an odd, recurring fixation in Washington. The fact that the US government borrows a lot of money each year just isn’t a huge problem right now. Interest rates are incredibly low. The US Treasury has no problem rolling over its debt and never misses a payment. The one thing that might be worth fretting about is that someday in the future, our children and grandchildren could have to pay higher taxes to pay down the debt if it gets unmanageable. But if you’re that worried about the future, why not talk about global warming? It’s an issue that’s already affecting us today  —   but will also shape the next 10, 000 years of life on this planet. And it’s not just a question of whether our grandchildren might have to pay somewhat higher taxes, it’s a question of whether   droughts will ravage the Southwest, or whether the city of Miami will drown beneath the rising seas, or whether vital coral reefs will vanish forever. Quibbling over the payroll tax seems quaint by comparison.      September was 381st consecutive month   average global temperatures. By @wildweatherdan via #AGUblogs @AGU_Eoshttps:  .  —   Am Geophysical Union (@theAGU) October 20, 2016    But none of the moderators asked about global warming at all. Not in the first presidential debate. Not in the vice presidential debate. Not in the second presidential debate.* Not in the third presidential debate. Hillary Clinton   the topic, occasionally, but that was it. Humanity is departing from the stable climatic conditions that allowed civilization to thrive, yet the most powerful nation on Earth can’t set aside five minutes to discuss.    It’s possible the debate moderators don’t understand what’s at stake. It’s possible they don’t care. Or it’s possible they’re afraid that any question on the topic might seem too partisan. After all, Clinton thinks the issue is pretty serious and has a bunch of proposals around it, whereas Trump says it’s all a hoax invented by the Chinese. Under the circumstances, even a halfway intelligent question about climate policy would sound “biased. ”  The national debt is a safer topic  —   it’s something members of both parties have been chattering about for years. And if it’s bipartisan, it must be serious. Whereas with global warming, the entire GOP has nuttily convinced itself that all the world’s climate scientists must be making things up. So, for the sake of objectivity and balance, the moderators decided to ignore the issue altogether. Nice work.     —   —   —   * The closest anyone came was in the second presidential debate, when audience member (and   operator) Ken Bone asked the candidates: “What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?” That’s not a direct climate question, but it certainly touches on crucial adjacent topics.

"Bizarre feathered ‘chicken’ dinosaur once roamed China. A previously unknown feathered dinosaur once roamed northeast China more than 125 million years ago  —   and could be earth’s oldest link to modern birds, researchers said. The      creature named “Jianianhualong tengi” had tail feathers, according to researchers who found the   fossilized remains in Baicai Gou in Liaoning province. The dinosaur’s asymmetrical tail feathers shows it might have had the ability to fly. “They may even have have been first associated with other   functions, perhaps even display,” study leader Michael Pittman from the University of Hong Kong wrote in Nature Communications this week,  Even if Jianianhualong tengi didn’t fly, its discovery could play a major role in tracing the evolution of birds. “Asymmetrical feathers have been associated with flight capability, but are also found in species that do not fly, and their appearance was a major event in feather evolution,” study authors wrote, ",1.0
"When Americans land in trouble abroad, these expats step in.  Minutes before Holland America’s Nieuw Amsterdam was scheduled to depart for Fort Lauderdale, Berit and Dan Wick received an urgent call at home. Without delay, the couple hailed a taxi to the port terminal in Cartagena, Colombia. Once aboard the vessel, Dan approached an American stretched out on a hospital bed surrounded by the ship’s doctors and nurses. The woman was pale and struggling to breathe; an oxygen mask covered her face. Her    waited by the gangplank, filled with worry and concern. Dan accompanied Sue Wright in the ambulance, a bumpy ride along cobblestone roads. Berit loaded Rosemary Cox and 16 days’ worth of luggage into a car. By the time they reached the hospital, the cruise ship had sailed off. But the Wicks  —   strangers at first, advocates to the very end  —   stuck by the pair until they were well enough to return home a week later.      “It’s a sudden shock for people to find themselves in a foreign country, not speaking the language, not expecting to be disembarked from an enjoyable cruise and having a serious medical condition,” said Dan, a Californian who moved with his wife and daughter to Colombia in 2003. “We are here for them, to be a familiar North American face, helping with logistics, language and arranging to get them back home. ” The Wicks are good Samaritans of a specific breed: The expats act as wardens on behalf of the U. S. State Department. Their voluntary role in the consular services program is specific in mission (help your fellow Americans) and broad in services (do whatever you can to achieve Goal A).   “I am often called upon to assist U. S. citizen travelers who encounter difficult and often confusing situations that require immediate assistance, from stolen passports and money, incarceration for breaking foreign laws, political unrest, falling ill and even personal conflicts resulting in physical assault,” John Mackey, a   warden in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, wrote by email.  The program originated during the 1930s, when embassies relied on volunteers to disseminate critical information to citizens living abroad. The name derives from World War II air raid wardens who patrolled territories in the United Kingdom and United States. The service resembled a phone tree: Participants would knock on doors and ring up landlines to deliver messages ranging from administrative updates (absentee voting, Social Security benefits) to   warnings (evacuation meeting points,   shelters). These days, most of the 276 overseas missions can dispatch information electronically. Technological innovations have freed up the wardens to focus more on American tourists whose trips have taken an unpredictable turn down an unimaginable road.  “These people get themselves into trouble,” said Adriana Michele, a New Yorker who has dedicated more than 25 years to volunteering in Cartagena. The wardens can help them get out of it.    Community spirit Who are the wardens and, more important, how can you flag one down if you’re in a bind? Got a name and number? The wardens are civilians  —   emphasis on    employees  —   with strong ties to their community a la Mister Rogers. They are typically fluent in the culture, habits, layout and language of their adopted country. Elizabeth Gracon, a U. S. embassy official in Colombia, described them as “a local face on the ground. ”  Many of the volunteers have   jobs. Tommy Phillips, a   warden in China, is the   of Bread Rock Bistro, a popular expat restaurant in Yanji, in the northeastern province of Jilin. Jennifer O’Sullivan teaches yoga and runs a handful of bars and cafes with her husband in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Other wardens are retired or iced their careers to pursue humanitarian projects. The Wicks, for instance, left Silicon Valley to volunteer at a school in Cartagena and start a foundation. Despite the wardens’ divergent backgrounds, they all share a charitable streak. “They are Americans helping Americans,” said Christine Fagan, a division chief in the department’s Office of Overseas Citizens Services. “Also, the warden can give the local perspective. ”  Recruitment into the program is a casual affair. A consular officer might deliver an open invitation to join the warden network during a    meeting or an embassy event. Or a member might entice a friend to join the club, as was the case with Tommy, a veteran who explained that he wanted to “continue to serve my country however I could. ” Wardens are found in every country with State Department presence. The size of the cadre depends on the destination and its level of development. Urban centers with strong teleconnectivity need fewer volunteers than remote areas with primitive communication systems. Communities without a consular office nearby also lean more heavily on wardens.     State Department volunteer wardens Dan Wick, left, and his wife, Berit Wick, right, speak with physician Martin Caravajal at a hospital in Cartagena, Colombia, that takes care of many American travelers. The Wicks’ role is to help fellow Americans in distress. (Andrea Sachs   Washington Post)  “They can assist Americans who can’t get to the embassy,” Fagan said.   Because of the program’s informal arrangement (for instance, there is no training or manual) officials do not have a global head count of participants. But they can provide a snapshot of the warden census map: Lebanon, 90; Thailand, 73; Honduras, 25; Bangladesh; 23; Togo, 22; Chad, 18. Colombia claims 25 wardens, including four in Cartagena. I met the quartet during my October visit, but in arbitrary life, I would not have known their identities unless I had signaled an S. O. S.  So how do you, the American traveler, solicit help from a warden? You don’t.  The chain of command starts with the embassy. The tourist or concerned family members in the States will contact the office for help. The staff might resolve the situation   or an officer might notify the warden for assistance. The issue might be an easy fix, such replacing a stolen passport. Or it might demand a significant amount of time and emotion on the volunteer’s part. For example, if an American dies abroad.   “We know a lot more about repatriation than I ever thought we would,” Berit said. During last year’s cruising season, the Wicks handled the arrangements for three deaths. Berit still tears up over the memory of a Chicago woman who had been cruising with her husband three years ago when she became ill. She died while Berit was in the ICU with her.  An increasing load “¿Cómo estás?” the MediHelp hospital nurse asked. “How are you?” Berit translated. “I’m fine,” Richard Adelson answered from his perch on a padded chair. “Do you want anything from the minibar . . . like a Scotch on the rocks,” Berit joked, veering from the official script. The nurse brought Richard a small cup of vanilla ice cream, a welcome break from the infirmary staple of rice, rice, rice. The Adelsons capped off a very busy week for the Wicks, who also receive calls from the port agents about incoming medical cases. Sue Wright was the first patient to disembark, on a Wednesday in  . The ship also dropped off an Indonesian crew member with a torn esophagus. The next day, the Cartagena hospital received a District woman who had hit her head on a tree branch during a shore excursion and lost consciousness. An interpreter had accompanied the   cruiser. The Wicks had to juggle conversations in English, Spanish and sign language. On Saturday, the couple helped a German woman and her partner, who suffered a stroke aboard their sailboat. On Sunday, a crewman with a broken tooth arrived. So did Richard. “It was very frightening. I can’t imagine if I had been left in a strange country and couldn’t speak the language,” said Barbara Adelson, his wife. “It was such a relief knowing that there was someone to help us. ” During Richard’s hospitalization, the Wicks provided Barbara with an Internet phone, so that she could converse with her children in the States. They compiled a cheat sheet of essential Spanish words and phrases for Richard, including tengo sed (thirsty) dolor (pain) and pato (bed pan). They confabbed with doctors about his condition and translated their diagnoses. And they called the Adelsons’   company numerous times, updating the agents on his recovery and submitting the information required for reimbursement. They also invited the family (son Brian later flew down from Philadelphia) to bunk at their   condominium. Amenities included hot showers,   meals and fast friends, including Sue and Rosemary, who were also guests.  “They’ve made me feel so amazing,” Barbara said. “I feel like I’ve known them forever. ”     Over the years, as more cruise lines have added Cartagena to their itineraries, the number of warden cases have ballooned. (dbimages   Stock Photo)  On Monday night, the hosts and their visitors gathered around the dining table on the balcony. The air was warm, and the harbor shimmered under the city lights. Dan said grace. Everyone uttered, “Amen. ” Then they dug into the spread of salmon, salad and mashed potatoes, and drained a bottle of wine. On average, the Wicks tend to about 60 impaired travelers a year. About   are American, and nearly half stay with them. They still remember their first case from about eight years ago. A young woman ran out of money. They visited her at her hostel while she waited for a government loan to fund her trip home. Over the years, as more cruise lines have added Cartagena to their itineraries, the number of cases has ballooned. When the couple moved to town, about a dozen ships docked here; now a staggered parade of 225 vessels marches over from October to May. Back then, they didn’t know much about medical procedures or the mechanics of travel insurance. Not so now. On the day the hospital released Richard, the Wicks submitted a    form to the insurance company. They explained to the Adelsons that the company would arrange and cover their travel expenses to Philadelphia. However, the process could take several days. A second option: Pay out of pocket and fly back tomorrow.   “I want him home,” Barbara said. “That’s wise,” Barit replied. The next morning, Rosemary, Sue, Richard, Barbara and Brian all boarded the same flight to Miami.  Emotional attachment Finally, a quiet day.  Though cruisers surged through town, there were no calamities or crises. I stopped by Adriana’s jewelry shop, which was thick with tourists ogling emeralds. She invited me into her office, which was tucked behind the maze of glass cases.  “Things were easier back then,” she said of Cartagena in the  . “There weren’t that many tourists. ” Adriana and Hortensia de la Rosa, her Colombian assistant and an honorary warden, receive three to four calls from the embassy a year. One   story involved a mentally unstable mother who threatened to jump off a building. Another involved a bipolar man who succumbed to the darker elements of the city.  “Some people have drug problems and hook up with prostitutes,” she said.  Hortensia joined the conversation and shared a tragic tale about a young man and his uncle, who had taken him on a   trip. The    who had cocaine in his system, toppled off a   balcony. His parents and grandparents flew down when he was in a coma. Hortensia helped them at the hospital, and later with repatriating the body of their loved one.  “You get to know them,” Hortensia said of the victims, “and you can’t avoid getting emotionally involved. ” The attachments tug in both directions. Earlier in the week, she had told me about a family from New York who were traveling in a van to Barranquilla when it crashed. The husband’s rib pierced his lung. Over the Christmas holiday weekend, Hortensia and Adriana tracked down a doctor who could operate on him immediately. During surgery, Hortensia held his wallet and clothes while waiting. Later that evening, she peered through the window of the recovery room. The American gave her a  . Hortensia paused the story and reached into her purse. She pulled out a crumpled letter. The typed note was from the American to the U. S. ambassador to Colombia. She pressed a tissue to her eyes as we read the note together. He wrote that Hortensia “was there to help my family in any way she could. ” He proceeded to list those ways. He concluded with: “That relationship produced real results for us. We will never forget. ” A few months later, Hortensia and Adriana received a certificate of appreciation from the U. S. Embassy in Bogota. The accolade sits on a shelf in Adriana’s office, framed and under glass.   A last look On my last full day in Cartagena, I took a break from the hospital visits to explore Old Town, a walled labyrinth of Spanish colonial buildings and festive plazas. When I left the medical center, the Wicks had been translating   instructions for the German sailor and were trying to locate a mandarin speaker for a Chinese crewman in the intensive care unit. I felt a twinge of guilt as I wandered in and out of shops and drank cup after cup of Colombian coffee. In the early evening, I received a text from the Wicks that they were finally leaving the hospital. We met for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Getsemani, a spirited neighborhood emerging from a tawdry period. Over pasta and wine, we reviewed the patients of the week. Dan showed me an email from Sue, who thanked the couple for their help and hospitality. He shared a message from Brian, who wrote that he didn’t know how his parents would have managed without them. Dan and Berit were touched by the gratitude, but they didn’t linger long on the events. They knew that as each case closes, another one opens. The next afternoon, they were planning on visiting a cruiser in a Barranquilla hospital. The man had pneumonia and no money. That was all the information they knew and, for their mission, all they needed to know.  More from Travel:   That rescue dog doesn’t need a home.

"December’s unemployment rate is almost here — but it doesn’t really matter. The Labor Department on Friday will announce the unemployment rate for December, and the result will present to   Donald Trump a great opportunity to align himself with what Americans already know about the job market. The jobless rate is expected to rise from 4. 6 percent in November to 4. 7 percent last month. But both of those numbers are laughable and Trump has already said  —   including    —   that the figures misrepresent what’s really going on. It’s time for the   to say it again. The first problem with the unemployment rate is the way it’s gathered. It’s been years since I broke the story about how surveyors for the Census Bureau were cheating when they went to people’s homes to ask their employment status. That problem has probably been fixed, except that, without the cheating, the surveyors are now getting many fewer responses. This throws the reliability of the surveys into question. The second problem occurs once the figures are gathered. The Labor Department takes the numbers provided by the Census Bureau and comes up with several different unemployment rates. The one that showed 4. 6 percent unemployment in November doesn’t include most of the people who have given up looking for work because they don’t think any suitable jobs for them exist. When you add in just some of the people who have quit looking, or who have taken   jobs because they couldn’t find   gigs, the unemployment rate jumps to 9. 3 percent. That’s the Labor Department’s number  —   called the    —   and it doesn’t include people who haven’t looked for a job in more than a year. If you include all those “discouraged workers,” as they are referred to, the jobless rate is . . . nobody really knows, but it could be around 20 percent, according to experts who make their own calculations. Most folks already understand why the unemployment rate is misleading, thanks to people like me who’ve been shouting about it for years. But many don’t, and that is where the PEOTUS could have a problem. When the economy starts doing better  —   or maybe I should say “if” the economy gets better  —   the unemployment rate should rise. Why? Because as the prospects of finding a job improve many of those discouraged workers will again start looking. And that’ll make these new job seekers show up in the calculations as unemployed, making the jobless rate climb. In fact, that may already be happening. So if Trump actually succeeds in getting the economy to perform better, the unemployment rate will be telling the opposite story. And that, too, may already be happening. The experts also believe that 185, 000 new jobs were created in December. If that’s the number, it will be slightly better than the 178, 000 in November. Trump already understands the problem with job growth: The pace of expansion hasn’t been fast enough to absorb even the number of people trying to enter the workforce for the first time  —   much less those who were laid off during the Great Recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis, and since. And assumptions and guesses make the monthly job gains figure completely inaccurate.",1.0
"The National Weather Service’s outrageous snow job. Looks like nanny ninnies are running the National Weather Service, and they’re too timid to level with the public. Up to a     of the white fluffy stuff would fall on the city on Tuesday, NWS officials warned before the storm. Yet when they got later reports predicting markedly less snowfall, they decided to go with the original forecast anyway. Sure enough, accumulations turned out lower: Only 7. 6 inches fell in Central Park. “Out of extreme caution we decided to stick with higher amounts,” says the Weather Prediction Center’s Greg Carbin  —   meaning meteorologists don’t trust the public to decide for itself. He’s proud of that, too: “I actually think . . . the actions [by states and cities] taken in advance of the event were exceptional. ” “Exceptional”? The region made costly decisions based on the dishonest warning: Shops closed and lost precious business. Companies saw workers stay home. Public transportation was curtailed or suspended. Based on predications of what areas would be   the state sent   equipment to the city and Long Island. But other parts of the state suffered worse  —   as the Weather Service should have warned. An NWS statement Wednesday tried to make excuses: “Even with the changeover” in the forecast to sleet and freezing rain, “driving during the morning commute was likely to be a real problem,” and updating the warnings might’ve lulled folks into a false sense of security. Instead, the NWS forecast lulled them into a false sense of fear, and cost a fortune. It’s not a meteorologist’s job to tell people what to do  —   only to share his or her best information on what’s coming, so they can decide for themselves. Keep trying to manage behavior by falsifying facts, and you’re sure to fail in the long run  —   because soon, folks won’t believe any of your forecasts.",1.0

"New York Times: We blew it on Trump. The Gray Lady feels the agony of political defeat  —   in her reputation and in her wallet. After taking a beating almost as brutal as Hillary Clinton’s, the New York Times on Friday made an extraordinary appeal to its readers to stand by her. The publisher’s letter to subscribers was part apology and part defense of its campaign coverage, but the key takeaway was a pledge to do better. Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. admitted the paper failed to appreciate Donald Trump’s appeal. “After such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” While insisting his staff had “reported on both candidates fairly,” he also vowed that the paper would “rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism. That is to report America and the world honestly, without fear or favor. ” Ah, there’s the rub. Had the paper actually been fair to both candidates, it wouldn’t need to rededicate itself to honest reporting. And it wouldn’t have been totally blindsided by Trump’s victory. Instead, because it demonized Trump from start to finish, it failed to realize he was onto something. And because the paper decided that Trump’s supporters were a rabble of racist rednecks and homophobes, it didn’t have a clue about what was happening in the lives of the Americans who elected the new president. Sulzberger’s letter alludes to this, promising that the paper will “striv[e] always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you. ” But bad or sloppy journalism doesn’t fully capture the Times’ sins. Not after it announced that it was breaking its rules of coverage because Trump didn’t deserve fairness.  most Times reporters saw Trump “as an abnormal and potentially dangerous candidate” and thus couldn’t be  . That wasn’t one reporter talking  —   it was policy. The standards, developed over decades to force reporters and editors to be fair and to build public trust, were effectively eliminated as too restrictive for the Trump phenomenon. The man responsible for that rash decision, top editor Dean Baquet, later said the Rutenberg piece “nailed” his thinking, and went on to insist that Trump “challenged our language” and that “He will have changed journalism. ” Baquet also said of the struggle for fairness, “I think that Trump has ended that struggle,” adding: “we now say stuff. We   him. We write it more powerfully that it’s false. ” Baquet was wrong. Trump indeed was challenging, but it was Baquet who changed journalism. He’s the one who decided that the standards of fairness and nonpartisanship could be broken without consequence. After that, the floodgates opened, and virtually every   news article reflected a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton. Stories, photos, headlines, placement in the paper  —   all the tools were used to pick a president, the facts be damned. Now the bill is coming due.   and mocked even by liberals for its bias, the paper is also apparently bleeding readers  —   and money. I’ve gotten letters from people who say they canceled their Times subscriptions and, to judge from a cryptic line in a Thursday article, the problem is more than anecdotal. Citing reader anger over election coverage,   “Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions. ” Having grown up at the Times, I am pained by its decline. More troubling, as the flagship of American journalism, it is giving all reporters a black eye. Its standards were the source of its credibility, and eliminating them has made it less than ordinary. It is because of those concerns that I repeat a suggestion about how to fix the mess. Because he now concedes a problem, perhaps Sulzberger will consider taking action. Using an outside law firm or even   reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to Baquet’s political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the newsroom. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times’ embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesn’t change now, the Gray Lady’s days surely are numbered. To our readers, When the biggest political story of the year reached a dramatic and unexpected climax late Tuesday night, our newsroom turned on a dime and did what it has done for nearly two years  —   cover the 2016 election with agility and creativity. After such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters? What forces and strains in America drove this divisive election and outcome? Most important, how will a president who remains a largely enigmatic figure actually govern when he takes office? As we reflect on this week’s momentous result, and the months of reporting and polling that preceded it, we aim to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of Times journalism. That is to report America and the world honestly, without fear or favor, striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you. It is also to hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly. We believe we reported on both candidates fairly during the presidential campaign. You can rely on The New York Times to bring the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence to our coverage of the new president and his team. We cannot deliver the independent, original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers. We want to take this opportunity, on behalf of all Times journalists, to thank you for that loyalty. Sincerely, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr.  Publisher Dean Baquet  Executive Editor",1.0
"10 things we learned about Trump adviser Steve Bannon from this recently surfaced speech.  Stephen Bannon, the CEO of   media outlet Breitbart News and Donald Trump’s newly named chief strategist, believes we are in the midst of a crisis  —   of both global economy and moral standing.     Godlessness and libertarianism has “sapped the strength of the   West to defend its ideals,” and the Muslim world is growing in numbers, Bannon told a conference at the Vatican in 2014. “Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act. ”  BuzzFeed published the transcript of Bannon’s remarks at a conference hosted by the Human Dignity Institute and attended by some of Europe’s most conservative religious voices. Two years ago, before Trump’s rise in American politics or the Brexit vote, Bannon made a case for a populist conservative movement and explained the biggest dangers facing the Christian world, while he downplayed the roles racism and bigotry often play in these fringe right movements.    Now, as Bannon’s worldview has direct access to the Oval Office, it’s of the utmost importance to understand the ideology that will have the private ear of the 45th president of the United States.    Here are 10 of the key passages from the transcript of Bannon’s remarks, framing a worldview that could shape the next four years of a Trump administration  —   and what they tell us about the man who spent years mainstreaming white nationalism.    1) Bannon says: We are in an era of global economic crisis Bannon believes in a golden era of economic prosperity; a period in the   century  —   the Pax Americana  —   distinct as a time of peace in the Western Hemisphere. But since the fall of the Soviet Union, he says, the world has come off track, and what has ensued is a crisis in capitalism:  The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave us the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support, whether it’s the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and eventually to take back continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric empire in the Far East. That capitalism really generated tremendous wealth. And that wealth was really distributed among a middle class, a rising middle class, people who come from really   environments and created what we really call a Pax Americana. It was many, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we’ve come partly offtrack in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we’re starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism.     This “enlightened capitalism” has been replaced with a “disturbing” form of “libertarian conservatism,” Bannon explains: It is a capitalism that really looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost  —   as many of the precepts of Marx  —   and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger generation [that] they’re really finding quite attractive. And if they don’t see another alternative, it’s going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of “personal freedom. ” The idea of a golden era resonates with Trump’s rise: He made the tagline of his campaign “Make America Great Again,” harking back to an undefined period of great wealth. The motto led many on the left  —   including President Barack Obama  —   to question which era Trump was referring to with his “again,” pointing out the immense social and cultural strides that have been made since the Pax Americana era began.     2) The best capitalist leaders held   beliefs There is a religious and moral underpinning to Bannon’s understanding of economic prosperity and “enlightened capitalism. ” In other words, the golden era of capitalism he speaks of  —   when the Western world was enjoying an abundance of wealth and peace  —   was dictated by   ideals: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the   West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active participants in the Christians’ faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that’s incredibly important and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today  —   I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don’t believe that our forefathers had that same belief.   ideals have a long history in conservative movements, from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan, emphasizing the importance of traditional American religious values in all aspects of life. The notion feeds the image of a simpler and more homogeneous nation, which Trump’s campaign largely signaled throughout the race. 3) The secular and Muslim worlds have put the   West in crisis Therefore, Bannon’s “crisis of capitalism,” as he talks about earlier in his remarks, is paired with a crisis of faith  —   a weakening of   ideals, brought on by the recent popularity of secularism and the growth of the Muslim world. Bannon sees secularism as a crisis among younger generations: With “younger people, especially millennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration. ” That tendency, as well as the rise of Eastern religion, has weakened the pillars of Western ideals, Bannon believes:     I certainly think secularism has sapped the strength of the   West to defend its ideals, right? If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the   West and its tenets, often times, particularly when you deal with the elites, you’re looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was  —   and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them  —   we have to face a very unpleasant fact: And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global. It’s going global in scale, and today’s technology, today’s media, today’s access to weapons of mass destruction, it’s going to lead to a global conflict that I believe has to be confronted today.   It’s not too far a leap to what we saw in the 2016 election, with the “othering” of Muslim American communities. Trump’s insistence to look at Islam with the utmost skepticism effectively created an    mentality between Americans and Muslim Americans. 4) These crises have given way to ISIS The byproduct of these crises in   faith and capitalism “converges” on ISIS, Bannon says. “We are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it,” he said:  If you look at what’s happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if you look at the sophistication of which they’ve taken the tools of capitalism. They have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a “river of blood” if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is going to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it’s going to come to Western Europe, it’s going to come to the United Kingdom. And so I think we are in a crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we’re now, I believe, at the beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.  Much of this rhetoric has continued, asserting that the incompetence of the left led to the rise of ISIS. Trump even once wrongly claimed Obama was the “founder” of ISIS.  5) ISIS is the biggest threat, and the   West needs to stand up against it Bannon’s conclusion on much of this is the need to again strengthen the   stronghold against, most importantly, ISIS, but also what he implies are the creeping ideals of the East, or Islam:     I believe you should take a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that’s fine. If you look back at the long history of the   West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places   …     It bequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.  There has been every effort to heighten the fear of ISIS and terrorism throughout the election on Trump’s part  —   even as Americans’ direct threat of terrorism is vanishingly small. His promise to make American safe again, extreme calls for a ban on Muslim immigration, increased surveillance on Muslim communities, and so forth could very easily be interpreted as the execution of Bannon’s call for a   pushback. 6) The populist uprising is driven by economic anxiety There has been a lot of talk this election about the ideas behind Trump’s rise and whether they stemmed from economic anxiety or racial resentment. The two are clearly not mutually exclusive. Bannon, however, explained it as a byproduct of the 2008 bailouts:  So you can understand why middle class people having a tough go of it making $50 or $60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to pay for government sponsored bailouts, what you’ve created is really a free option. You say to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the upside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with stock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because middle class people are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars. And that’s what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the midlands of England, or whether it’s in Middle America. And I think people are fed up with it.  This populist revolt fell behind Trump this year. He was able to energize the white working class, a contingent of voters that largely led Trump’s victories in states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. 7) Bannon has seen incremental Tea Party success throughout the years  The strength of what were once fringe movements has proved shocking to many. But Bannon has been seeing their growing strength for years, arguing that even while losing in the election, the need to address Tea Party concerns has become increasingly visible in Washington:     And I think that’s why you’re seeing  —   when you read the media says, “tea party is losing, losing elections,” that is all BS. The elections we don’t win, we’re forcing those crony capitalists to come and admit that they’re not going to do this again. The whole narrative in Washington has been changed by this populist revolt that we call the grassroots of the tea party movement. And it’s specifically because those bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn’t make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people  —   by the way, and these are people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the finest institutions in the West. They should have known better.  Bannon’s own Breitbart may be the best articulation of the smaller successes. This year,   media outlets entered the mainstream, and as Bannon explained, these ideas, once only shared by the fringe, have been mainstreamed to the White House. 8) In 2014, Bannon said conservative populism would take over the world These remarks were given long before Trump’s rise or the passing of Brexit. But in 2014, Bannon saw a shifting tide globally, a brand of conservative populism taking hold: And that   revolt is really a global revolt. I think you’re going to see it in Latin America, I think you’re going to see it in Asia, I think you’ve already seen it in India. Modi’s great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think this is a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is reporting that throughout the world. Breitbart found its niche with these “working” people, Bannon said, pairing it with social conservatism:  We’re the voice of the   movement, the voice of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we’re winning victory after victory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a platform of which they can use. [. ..] I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States and Latin America don’t believe that. They believe they know what’s best for how they will comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how to educate their families. So I think you’re seeing a global reaction to centralized government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington, DC, or that government is in Brussels.      Bannon was right to cue a change in tide; conservative populist movements have been gaining steam globally, whether with the Brexit win in the United Kingdom, Trump’s rise in the US, or the Front National in France. But each of these   movements has also been paired with strong racial resentments and xenophobic tendencies, which Bannon’s understanding of the working and “socially conservative” right seems to miss. 9) He believes racism and nativist beliefs have been “washed out” in the    …     On multiple occasions, Bannon was asked to comment on the racist undertones  —   and, at times, explicit overtones  —   of these   populist movements. He answered once, downplaying the role racism plays in the movement. “I think when you look at any kind of revolution  —   and this is a revolution  —   you always have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you’ll see more of a mainstream   populist movement,” he said.  In other words, there will always be the more extreme factions of a movement  —   but racism and nativism are “washed out” on the whole, he said: It seems that they have had some aspects that may be   or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this, and we’ve been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc. which it’s not. But there’s always elements who turn up at these things, whether it’s militia guys or whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind of washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the margins I think get marginalized more and more. Of course, as we have seen throughout both the movements in the United Kingdom with the Brexit referendum and Trump’s rise, racial anxiety and xenophobia have played central roles  —   and have often translated to objectively discriminatory policy proposals like, most recently, the Muslim registry.    10)   …    and that Putin is a kleptocrat  —   but with good leadership ideas Two years before Trump’s presidential victory, and a campaign during which Trump openly complimented Putin’s leadership qualities, Bannon summed up Putin similarly, calling him a strong traditionalist leading an important nationalist movement:  I’m not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the   West really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes  —   particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism  —   and I happen to think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, and I think it’s what can see us forward. You know, Putin’s been quite an interesting character. He’s also very, very, very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it’s something that we have to be very much on guard of.   Putin had a central role in the American election  —   he was an open supporter of Trump and long blamed by Clinton’s campaign for attempting to meddle in the democratic process. Bannon’s understanding of him fits in line with both these realities: that he has leadership qualities Trump seems to admire, and that he is a   dictatorial leader.  Watch: It’s up to America’s institutions to check Trump     ",-1.0
"Winter Storm Jonas targets DC, New York, Boston. Here’s what we know..  Humans of the East Coast, listen: A major, major winter storm is underway.    Washington, DC, Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia are all in line for what forecasters say could be a historic amount of snow. While forecasts may change, the storm is currently expected to bring more than a foot of snow to some major cities, along with whiteout conditions, high winds, and major coastal flooding. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for most of the   From Virginia to Long Island, New York. The weather service reports:  The snow will be heavy at times through late Saturday before tapering off by early Sunday morning. The strongest winds and greatest potential for blizzard conditions will be during the day Saturday.               (National Weather Service) During the blizzard, expect wind gust up to 55 miles per hour, whiteout conditions, and downed power lines. Travel, if not impossible, will be extremely dangerous.    ”Do not travel,” the weather service warns bluntly. ”If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you.” Authorities in several affected states have declared states of emergency. Thousands of flights have been canceled.    The storm’s bullseye appears to directly target Washington and Baltimore. Accumulations of 18 inches or more are expected in this region. Blizzard conditions are expected to begin around 3 pm Friday in these cities and last until Sunday morning.           National Weather Service Forecasters are also stressing the ability of this storm to produce surges of four to five feet along the New Jersey and New York shorelines. ”Such flooding would probably rival Hurricane Irene’s in New York City,” Slate’s Eric Holthaus writes. Some towns on the Jersey shore have issued evacuation orders for residents.              National Weather Service Some major cities could see at least a foot of snow Here are the latest snowfall projections from the National Weather Service:           Meteorologists  —   who live for this sort of thing  —   were saying as early as Wednesday the storm may be a record breaker.

And it’s not just because the national media is largely located within the   corridor. The   is one of the most densely populated regions in the country. When it snows here, it affects millions of people. And while Boston may be extremely familiar with dealing with large snowfall accumulations, the other East Coast cities are sometimes brought to a standstill by just a few inches. A huge winter storm in the Northeast not only keeps millions of people in their homes but can also disrupt major industries and the federal government. The 2010 ”Snowmageddon” blizzard was estimated to cost New York $700 million in lost wages and retail sales.                                          What’s also notable about this storm is how far in advance many weather prediction models have converged on the forecast. ”Since early Saturday, nearly every single run of every major model has shown the potential for a foot or two of snowfall on a track to hit somewhere between Northern Virginia and Boston,” Slate’s Holthaus writes.  The consistency of the #DC bullseye has been astounding. Run after run. Tonight’s GEFS. 2 feet or bust. pic. twitter.   —   Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) January 21, 2016  At Weather Underground, Bob Henson said the models are in ”remarkable agreement.” Currently, a   system is making its way across the southern United States. When it meets the ocean, Henson writes ”the   cyclone will funnel warm, moist air from the tropical Atlantic into the region, with the air mass cooling and generating snow as it rises.”           (National Weather Service) According to Holthaus, the ”most remarkable thing about this week’s snowstorm is the sheer amount of water that will be available to be turned into snowflakes.”    Meteorologists are calling this weather system a ”textbook” example of a system that can produce a lot of snow, comparing it to big winter storms such as the blizzard of 1996 which dropped 48 inches in some areas and caused $3 billion in damages and the Snowmageddon storm of 2010. Here’s what the forecasts are currently calling for (though keep in mind that this could change as we get closer to Friday). Right now DC and Baltimore are projected to receive the heaviest amounts, and the brunt of the blizzard conditions. Depending on how closely the storm tracks to the coast, the cities farther north could either see a burial or just a dusting. In DC ”Snow totals in our area are forecast to be at least 16 inches, with 24 to 30 inches or so possible in some spots, especially north and west of the District,”  the Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang writes of snowfall potential in the region.  08z NWS for DC area is still  ” snowfall Blowing and drifting will create a polar landscape.

But the latest runs of major forecast models Friday morning were getting more extreme    weather service meteorologists’ best guess for the Baltimore area is in the realm of 24 to 30 inches, with more than 30 inches possible if the storm overperforms. If it underperforms, we’re still looking at nearly a foot of snow.  In Philly ”For the immediate Philadelphia area, [weather models] are calling for 12 to 16 inches of snow Friday night and Saturday into Saturday night,” the Philadelphia Inquirer reports.    In New York As of Friday morning, the National Weather Service predicts around eight to 10 inches of snow in New York City. But the city will be very close to the gradient where snowfall totals drop off dramatically. Depending on how the storm tracks, it could see a lot of snow, or just a few inches. In Boston News reports from the city still feeling the   stress of last year’s snow season  —   snow piles from the storms finally melted in July  —   are being cautious. (After last winter’s brutal blanketing, the city of Boston purchased a pair of   snowblowers, which look awesome.) The Boston Globe reports the storm may only ”sideswipe” the city: ”The heaviest snow, perhaps several inches, can be expected on the state’s south coast, while just an inch or two is expected in the northern part of the state.” In New Jersey  Here’s that updated snowfall map from @NWS_MountHolly from around 500 AM.

"5 things you should delete from Facebook immediately. Like Google, Facebook’s business is built around a simple design. It offers services to users for free, but those users are not Facebook’s customers. Instead, Facebook’s customers are companies that pay to run advertisements on its website and in its mobile apps. And the reason Facebook is so successful is that it offers its clients ways to target their ads better than most rivals. Why? Because Facebook knows so much about its users’ likes, dislikes and all sorts of other personal information. It’s a successful model and it’s not going to change anytime soon. By using Facebook, you’re agreeing to let the company make use of your data in order to serve you targeted ads. As long as you understand that, then go right ahead and use Facebook all you’d like  —   but there are still a few things you’re better off keeping to yourself.   Everything you look at, click, like and so on is recorded by Facebook and tied to your user profile. As a result, the site learns more and more about you in order to serve you ads that you’re most likely to click. Your profile also plays a big role as well, and there’s a great deal of personal information Facebook asks for in order to learn more about you. This info often does little or nothing to enhance your user experience though, so you might be better off omitting it.  Listing your home address in your profile or as a location in Facebook’s events section seems harmless enough, but you might want to think twice before doing it. First, there’s a security issue  —   if someone gains access to your account, they now know exactly where you live. Beyond that, location plays a huge role in the targeted advertising profile Facebook wants to build for you. If you must, just drop in a city and state but leave your street address a mystery.  The reasons for omitting your work address and history are similar to your home address, but your work history also makes it easy for annoying former   to find you. You already get enough of that on LinkedIn   …      You should absolutely give a phone number to Facebook, but it shouldn’t be your phone number. To clarify, supplying a phone number allows you to configure   authentication to better protect your Facebook account. But if you give Facebook your cellphone number, that exposes you in a few different ways. It means anyone and everyone who has your cell number can find you on Facebook, which is something you might not want. They also might be able to see profile info that you thought was only visible to your friends. Instead, use a service like Google Voice. You’ll get a free number and texts can be forwarded to your real cell or to an email address. That way you can use   authentication without supplying your actual cellphone number.  Withholding your birthday from Facebook is smart for a few reasons. First, it means you don’t have to bother thanking 300 of your friends each year when they post a note on your wall wishing you a happy birthday.

"Ted Cruz and other conservatives are arguing Obama shouldn’t get to replace Justice Scalia.  Within minutes of the confirmation of the news that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had died, influential conservatives were laying down the notion that President Obama shouldn’t be allowed to nominate a replacement.    Presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz led the charge:    Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement.  —   Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016       Conn Carroll, communications director for Utah Republican Mike Lee, who sits on the judiciary committee, joined the parade:       What is less than zero? The chances of Obama successfully appointing a Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia?  —   Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016          If anything this will put a full stop to all Obama judicial nominees going forward.  —   Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016    Conservative pundits like National Review’s Charles Cooke agreed:       Senate must simply refuse to appoint anybody. Would be outrageous to replace a giant like Scalia with a minnow like Sotomayor.  —   Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) February 13, 2016    The dynamics of the presidential race make it likely that the other Republican contenders will have to follow Cruz’s lead, and with the GOP presidential field unanimously opposed to allowing Obama to fill the vacancy it will be difficult for Senate Republicans to defy them. The small number of Republicans representing blue states may break from the pack, but pressure on the leadership to block confirmation will be intense.  Will be interesting to see if Kirk, Ayotte, Toomey, Johnson and Portman agree with noxious Cruz.  —   David Plouffe (@davidplouffe) February 13, 2016     As a precedent on the other side, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988  —   Ronald Reagan’s last year in office  —   though he’d been appointed the previous fall.

"What Would It Take to Shoot a Cannonball Into Orbit?. Gravity is pretty complicated if you think about it.  The motion of a ball falling on the surface of the Earth is caused by the same interaction as the moon orbiting the Earth.  That's crazy.  It's even crazier to realize that humans figured out that these two motions (falling ball and moon) are from the same gravitational force.  It sure doesn't look the same. Now imagine that you are around during the time of Isaac Newton (let's say early 1700s). How do you make this model of universal gravity?  I don't know how he did it, but Newton finally made the connection between the motion of planets (and moons) and the motion of objects on the surface of the Earth.  He explains this connection with his famous thought experiment of a cannon firing a ball from a tall mountain.  Here is his diagram from A Treatise of the System of the World. The diagram shows that an object moving on the surface of the Earth could eventually become an object orbiting the Earth.  He does this by imagining a cannonball—a super fast cannonball fired from a super high mountain.  The actual range of this ball would be farther than a normal cannon ball because you would have take into the curvature of the Earth.  Oh, right—you have to ignore air resistance.  In fact, if you shoot the ball fast enough it will ""miss"" the Earth entirely and enter a low Earth orbit. There you have it.  Gravity on the surface of the Earth is the same as the gravity between the moon and Earth.  Like I said, this is a big deal. I don't know who drew this diagram.  Maybe it's been modified over time.  However, I'm going to start with a version of it and then check it for accuracy.  In particular, I want to know the height of the mountain and I want to check the trajectory of the cannon ball paths.  It's just what I do. Although it's just an image, it is still useful to video analysis software to analyze this image.  Of course I'm going to use the free (and awesome) Tracker Video Analysis. From the image, I want to find the height of the ""mountain"".  That's fairly straightforward.  I can just set the radius of the Earth diagram to the radius of the Earth and then measure the height.  This puts the top of the mountain at 1.198 times the radius of the Earth from the center of the Earth (it's easier to deal with this in terms of the Earth's radius).  Oh, that makes the height of the mountain 19.8 percent the radius of the Earth—see how nice that is? Just for comparison, Mount Everest has a height of 8848 meters.  In terms of the Earth, this is 0.139 percent of the Earth's radius.  Or to put this another way, Newton's mountain is seriously ginormous.  I guess there are a bunch of other cool things we could consider regarding a mountain as high as Mt. Newton (that's what I'm calling it now)—but I will just leave those questions alone for now. What about the trajectory of these cannonballs launched from Mt. Newton?  Let's consider the trajectories of the first three cannonballs (the three lowest speeds).  I don't know anything about the time for these motions, but I can get the x and y positions.  Since this doesn't really fit with your normal projectile motion plots (y vs. x), I'm going to instead plot r vs. θ where r is the distance of the ball from the center of the Earth and θ is the angular position from the center of the Earth.  Yes, this is polar coordinates. Since the angle is measured from the horizontal x-axis, these cannonball trajectories start from the left and move right.  I hope that's not too confusing.  But the real question: are these trajectories real?  I could show that an object interacting gravitationally with the Earth should have an elliptical trajectory, but I'm not going to do that.  Nope.  Instead I am going to make a numerical model and adjust the starting velocity until I get something close to one of these. It's going to be fun. Here's the plan (it's the same plan as most numerical calculations).  But here are the basic steps. That's it.  Here's what you get.  Yes, this is an actual and real numerical calculation.  You can see the code by clicking the ""pencil"" icon.  In the code view, you can change the starting velocity. If you don't change that velocity, you are only cheating yourself.  Seriously.  Try changing the velocity. OK, that's starting to look like the Newton picture.  But can I get a trajectory that is JUST like the picture?  Let me adjust the starting velocity to see if I get data that is very similar to the above three shots (from the picture).  Here's what I get (as a plot of radial distance vs. θ). This is for the first three cannon shots and you can see the trajectories don't quite match up.  With my best estimates, these are cannonball speeds of 2800 m/s, 4200 m/s, and 6200 m/s.  Oh, just for fun the orbital velocity at the height of Mount Newton would be 7252 m/s.  Go ahead and use that velocity in the code example above.  It should make a nice orbit. So, let me summarize what we have.  The diagram of Newton's cannonball seems nice, but it's just a sketch.  If only Newton had python.",0.0

"Christmas in the Space Age: looking back at the wild, weird designs of mid-20th-century holidays.  The further we get from the 1965 debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas, one scene in particular seems stranger and stranger.     It’s the one where Charlie Brown and Linus go to purchase a Christmas tree for the kids’ Christmas pageant. At the giant Christmas tree lot, searchlights beam into the sky, and the trees plunked upon the ground are every color but green. Pinks and oranges and purples dominate the horizon, and the two little boys look for something real in the din. At one point, Linus knocks on a tree to hear the hollow clang of metal. It’s not just an oddly colored tree  —   it’s an aluminum one.  Certainly, we can sympathize with trying to find the “authentic” and   side of the holiday season in 2016. But who would ever buy an aluminum Christmas tree? That would seem garish and odd. And yet this kind of Space Age Christmas was enormously popular in the United States  —   and, oddly enough, the USSR  —   in the   century. The history of the movement, a kind of warmer, cozier modernism, is chronicled in the new book Midcentury Christmas by Sarah Archer.    Packed with photos of vintage Christmas decorations, advertisements, and other trinkets, Archer’s book is couched in her knowledge of design and American craft history. Archer’s text surrounding all those photos goes in depth to explain how the scientific optimism of the post —  World War II period got bound up in the hazy nostalgia Christmas has carried with it since the early 1800s (when it morphed from a rowdy night of drinking and reveling to the   holiday we know today).    I recently spoke with Archer about why this time period is so interesting, what Christmas always says about America, and the key difference between Scrooge and the Grinch. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.             Todd VanDerWerff What was the impetus for your deep dive into    Christmas Americana?    Sarah Archer I have written quite a lot about the studio craft movements in the postwar United States and the people who were moving to Black Mountain in the ’50s and making pottery and espadrilles.                I was fascinated by that counterculture, but slowly but surely I was teaching history of design and became more and more fascinated by the mirror universe of that craft counterculture, which is Tupperware and suburbia and [the famous suburban developments] Levittown.     I came across an article about people who collect Soviet New Year’s cards. It was this bizarre chapter in history, where in the USSR they didn’t celebrate Greek Orthodox Christmas, but they celebrated New Year’s. There was this character named Grandfather Frost, who’s basically Santa Claus. They would have these New Year’s trees, which are Christmas trees. They had these fascinating cards that had this Space Age aesthetic. I started Googling. Sure enough, there’s an American version of this. I started digging and digging, and I thought, it’s much more than just the cards.  There’s something really fascinating about the fact that for most of its history, [the modern celebration of] Christmas as we know it, which technically only dates from about 1820, has been steeped in this     mythic snowy past. It’s kind of Victorian, kind of medieval, sort of Arctic, vaguely Northern European, but it’s all very vague.  [In the   century] it’s like suddenly everybody is almost nostalgic for the future.                Why did that happen? Why, after at least 150 years of this deep nostalgia for the candlelit world of either an imagined Victorian past or an imagined medieval past, were Americans so keen to marry this nostalgia and coziness with the futuristic quality of the Space Age?  I was inspired very heavily by the work of a historian named Stephen Nissenbaum. He writes mostly about the 19th century, and I was fascinated by this idea that the root of Christmas, way, way back, the way it was celebrated, is closer to what we would consider Halloween or New Year’s. It was this very adult, risqué, not domestic, not cozy, not   holiday. [Ed. note: Indeed, many churches at the time didn’t observe Christmas because it was thought to be a holiday of bad influences.] But there’s a way in which the Halloween impulse remained, only the thing that’s wearing a costume is the house. It’s a way of trying on modernism. We’re not going to necessarily have a starburst clock hanging over the geometric fireplace, but we could try an aluminum tree, sure.     It’s a time period that I’ve always found fascinating. It’s my mom’s childhood era. As a kid who grew up in the ’80s, there was this fascination with the ’50s, this inherited nostalgia for baby boomers.  Todd VanDerWerff We’ve really snapped back hard to hazy nostalgia for an era of   open sleighs and the like. Do you think there’s a reason the Space Age influence faded away? Sarah Archer  When I was a kid in the ’80s, Santa Claus was Victorian. He wrote in calligraphy, and it was very  . Even in the   1980s, there was a very clear   focus to it.               There’s this period of time from roughly the end of World War II or the late ’50s, through the early ’70s, right before the oil embargo, where despite the fact that there were many awful things happening on the ground, there was this real sense of almost childlike optimism about the Space Race. That’s something my generation missed out on, because [we] were faintly aware that there were these disasters. For people of the [older] Neil deGrasse Tyson generation, kids who grew up in the ’60s and ’70s, [the Space Race] gave people something to look up to, literally and metaphorically, that was not cultural, particularly. You could be any race, any gender, and it was inspiring.  Something about the slow industrial decline of the ’70s made people turn their back on that and think, oh, it’s goofy. Aluminum trees suddenly became uncool. We’re rejecting the Levittown ideal, and many are too young to remember World War II, and they take all that stuff for granted and say, ”We don’t want your consumerism.” It was probably perceived as being kind of hokey.                   The space program has dialed back. It’s not in the forefront of people’s minds in the way that   technology is today. The Google, Twitter, Snapchat universe of inventiveness has taken the place of that in our consciousness in terms of what we produce as a culture. Either that or prestige television.  Todd VanDerWerff Well, I, for one, don’t really miss aluminum trees. But what are some things you found in researching this Christmas design aesthetic that you’re sad are no longer with us?  Sarah Archer There’s something about the unselfconscious love of kitsch that I find very endearing.  I didn’t grow up with [the stuff I discuss in the book] but I grew up with a basement full of ornaments. I had a Midwestern grandmother who did the full Marshall Fields department store concept tree every year. It was this real creative exuberance that I think has come back into vogue with a little bit of a smirk. There are people who throw kitschy, retro holiday parties. There was a real inventiveness and creativity to a lot of the DIY stuff. Coming out of the Depression and World War II, there’s this culture of women’s magazines and pamphlets and newsletters and companies encouraging readers to use what they have, create things with what they have on hand. After rationing is over in the ’50s and ’60s, all those same companies say, ”Now you can buy tinfoil again, and there’s a houseful of uses. You can create wreaths.” All these creative, fun things.               It’s not quite   because you have to buy tinfoil or you have to buy cellophane, but there’s something really wonderful about being at home with your folks or your friends or your siblings and making a project and figuring out how to use the material inventively in creating something unique that you can photograph and chuckle about for ages.     That’s good practice for being a flexible and thoughtful adult. There’s something really useful in that for any kid in any time period  —   making your own fun, but also really experimenting with what you have on hand and how you can be creative with it. That’s still around, but there’s a way in which the Waldorf toy aesthetic of ”We’re not going to buy anything sparkly or tacky” is a little sad.  I don’t have kids myself, but I’ve been around enough of them to know they like stuff that looks really tacky. [laughs] They like things that make noise and sparkle and flash. Not caring about it being cool, having uncool Christmas, is a beautiful thing. Todd VanDerWerff One thing you touch on in the book is that we still have a   in this Space Age Christmas thanks to the TV specials and Christmas songs of the era  —   like how Lucy wants an aluminum tree in A Charlie Brown Christmas. What are some of the ways this type of Christmas is still with us?  Sarah Archer My gut feeling is that there are two critical periods for Christmas. One is the Victorian age, when the Industrial Revolution was being disguised in this gaudy myth of ”It’s not from a department store. It’s Santa Claus.”  The second is the postwar period, because so many of the things we associate with cozy Christmas celebrations now are the product of this confluence of Hollywood and TV and the music industry and department stores and catalog shopping and all that stuff put together.               I watched a number of those specials again and was really taken aback by them. They’re very serious in their critique, particularly the Grinch and Charlie Brown.     Christmas is always a litmus test for how we feel about buying stuff. It comes at the same time every year. If you look at what the thinking around Christmas is in 1838 and 1912 and 1950, you always get a slightly different pulse of what Americans are thinking.  I started playing around in my head with Scrooge versus the Grinch. In the middle of the 19th century, you have a hero figure who is stingy and greedy and doesn’t care   about other people. When he has his epiphany, the answer is material abundance. It’s the Oprah effect. Everybody gets stuff.  Then, about a century later, the Grinch is similarly mean and stingy of heart, but his epiphany is the exact opposite. [Dr. Seuss] was writing this book at the height of the postwar boom, and the message is: You don’t need all this stuff. The Charlie Brown narrative is all this kind of angst about the Christmas tree. Do we want the shiny pink aluminum, newfangled, modern tree? Or do we want the sad, sentimental, small tree that’s not as impressive and has a kind of rustic charm? That’s a real clear way of translating for kids this [feeling of] wrestling with consumerism. What does it mean to be an American living in this age of abundance? Todd VanDerWerff If Christmas reflects how we feel about buying stuff, then how do our   Christmases reflect our evolving feelings about consumerism? Sarah Archer I grew up on the Upper West Side, and we lived around the corner from a store called   Think Big. It was this crazy concept store where the business plan was everything big. It was insane. It was like living in  ’s Playhouse. It was this really weird,    consumerist boom.                  Our parents were all people who had bought [Manhattan] real estate at the wrong time, they thought, living in this bankrupt, dirty city. Then suddenly everything was glossy and glitzy. There was a kind of novelty to it. I remember, even as a kid, thinking, wow, the adults are really intoxicated by this. Since that time, it’s a lot of “experiences, not stuff. ” That’s a fairly rarefied ideal if you actually have little kids. They do like stuff. What I hear often is there seems to be a real focus on turning away from that kind of consumption since the NAFTA boom, where credit’s gotten easier to obtain, things became really cheap, and Target proliferated.  We all have these storage units. We all have too much stuff. We’re all having to constantly clear things out.  So you want to spend whatever discretionary money you have on the cool trip or a cool factory tour or some experience that’s really interesting. It’s doing something that you’ll remember that doesn’t take up space, that may cost money but is more about using time.  We’re all  . Nowadays, perhaps the ultimate luxury good is time.

"Facebook fake-news writer: ‘I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me’.          What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they’re all    —   and invented by the same man. Paul Horner, the    impresario of a Facebook   empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he’s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. “South Park” lawsuit last year. But in recent months, Horner has found the   ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump’s son Eric and his   manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner’s  . His stories have also appeared as news on Google.    (Paul Horner)  In light of concerns that stories like Horner’s may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, Intersect called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news. This transcript has been edited for clarity, length and  —   ahem  —   bad language.  You’ve been writing fake news for a while now  —   you’re kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I’d call it hoaxing or fake news. You’d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250, 000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral? Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody   anything anymore  —   I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it. You mentioned Trump, and you’ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that? My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t   anything  —   they’ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3, 500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.    (Twitter via Mediaite)  Why? I mean  —   why would you even write that? Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests  —   trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it. I thought they’d   it, and it’d make them look worse. I mean that’s how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it’s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters  —   they just keep running with it! They never   anything! Now he’s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels [bad]. You think you personally helped elect Trump? I don’t know. I don’t know if I did or not. I don’t know. I don’t know.      Early on the morning of Nov. 9, Republican   Donald Trump addressed supporters in New York, declaring victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Here are key moments from that speech. (Sarah   Washington Post)   I guess I’m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election  —   especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs  —   why didn’t you stop? Why keep writing? I didn’t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn’t messing them up as much as I wanted  —   but I never thought he’d actually get elected. I didn’t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should’ve seen this coming  —   everyone assumed Hillary [Clinton] would just get in. But she didn’t, and Trump is president.  Speaking of Clinton  —   did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson’s, for that matter? (Horner’s Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.)  No. I hate Trump. Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that “no joke . . . in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it’s the cure for cancer, is   Republicans. ” That makes it sound like you’ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable. Yeah, it is. They don’t  . But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right? It’s great for anybody who does anything with satire  —   there’s nothing you can’t write about now that people won’t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy   stuff  —   like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line  —   and people went along with it! Facebook and Google recently announced that they’d no longer let   sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this? This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense  —   like, you wouldn’t believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10, 000 a month from AdSense.  I know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I’ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I’d be okay. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from [advertising on fake news sites] for them to just get rid of it. They’d lose a lot of money. But if it did really go away, that would suck. I don’t know what I would do. Thinking about this less selfishly, though  —   it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you’re describing are pretty scary. Yeah, I mean  —   a lot of the sites people are talking about, they’re just total BS sites. There’s no creativity or purpose behind them. I’m glad they’re getting rid of them. I don’t like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do  —   I spend more time on it. There’s purpose and meaning behind it. I don’t just write fake news just to write it. So, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they’re listing, and I’m like  —   good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I’m glad they’re getting rid of those sites. I just hope they don’t get rid of mine, too.

"Why people are speculating that Melania Trump was once an “illegal” immigrant.  Was Melania Trump once an “illegal immigrant”? The potential first lady is definitely an immigrant  —   she came from Slovenia in the   and settled in New York to work as a model. But lately, reporters (led by Frank Wilkinson at Bloomberg View) have been digging into the details. And they’re raising the possibility that Melania Trump may have violated the terms of her visa when she first came to the United States.    That might be true; it might not. It’s a juicy political story because of Donald Trump’s   stances on immigration. But what’s really at stake here is also a lot bigger than any accusations of Trump’s “hypocrisy. ” The gleeful schadenfreude around this story threatens to drown out the much more important point: US immigration laws are extremely difficult to understand and comply with perfectly. This is a serious problem that people less famous than Melania Trump struggle with all the time. It’s also the reason it’s simply impossible for the average person to know, for sure, when someone is “illegal. ” The Melania Trump controversy, explained We don’t actually know what kind of visa Melania Trump was on when she came to the United States 20 years ago (the campaign hasn’t said, exactly). But based on her biography and statements, there are two possibilities. And one of those possibilities is generating all the controversy.    If Melania originally came to the US to work as a model, she probably should have been on an   work visa for temporary   workers. (She could also have been on an O visa, for workers with “extraordinary” ability, but since the   literally has a category for fashion models, that’s the best bet.)     An   Pablo Zampolli, has told the Associated Press that he personally secured an   for her. If that’s what in fact happened, there’s no story here.  The problem is that some of Melania’s past statements make it seem like that wasn’t what she did.     On a couple of occasions, Melania has told reporters that after coming to the United States, she had to return to Slovenia “every few months” to get her visa renewed. That’s not something you have to do if you’re on a work visa. It is something you have to do if you’re on a   tourist visa, like the   visa for “temporary business visitors. ”  But if Melania was on a tourist visa, then, as a rule, she shouldn’t have been able to work for hire in the United States. Yet people who were active in the modeling industry at the time say it was common for Eastern European models to come here on   tourist visas and work anyway.             So that’s what reporters are raising questions about: They’re asking whether Melania came to the US on a   tourist visa in 1995, violated the terms of her visa by working as a model for hire, and returned to Slovenia every few months to get the visa renewed.     If that is what she did  —   and if she knew her visa didn’t allow her to work  —   then she committed fraud every time she got the visa renewed in Slovenia. That’s the issue at the heart of this controversy. Reporters have also raised questions about chronology here: Melania has said publicly that she came to the United States in 1996, whereas her biography and a recently surfaced nude photo shoot indicate that she actually came in 1995. That chronology isn’t hugely important in itself, though it might be more evidence that Melania is trying to cover up something about the circumstances of her arrival in the US. Not only is visa fraud a federal offense, but a fraudulent visa claim can undermine someone’s eventual eligibility for a green card  —   and even for citizenship. So if Melania is guilty of visa fraud, the US government could, if it really wanted to, try to strip her citizenship from her, by arguing she was never really a citizen at all.  Restrictions on work are a huge problem for many immigrants Melania Trump issued a statement Wednesday morning asserting, “I have at all times been in full compliance with the immigration laws of this country. Period. ”   pic. twitter.  —   MELANIA TRUMP (@MELANIATRUMP) August 4, 2016    Her critics were unappeased. Some reporters want her to specify exactly what sort of visa she was on, so the public can be sure it was one that allowed her to work legally.  But here’s the thing: It’s entirely possible that Melania Trump really didn’t commit visa fraud. It’s possible that she really was on a work visa and was misremembering the frequency with which she had to fly back to Slovenia (or exaggerating it to make a point) or mistook the interviews she had to have with immigration officials every time she flew home for a visa renewal.     It’s also possible that she was on a   visa for “temporary business visitors” but didn’t realize she wasn’t legally allowed to do modeling work on it. After all, it’s not exactly intuitive that a “business visitor” visa doesn’t allow its recipient to work. (The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website explains that activities under a business visitor visa “must be directly connected with and part of your work abroad. ”) A Politico article on the scandal, citing a labor standards advocacy group, says, “It was a common practice in the 1990s in New York for less scrupulous agencies to bring in foreign models to work illegally on temporary business and tourist visas. ” If Melania Trump was on the same sort of visa as everyone else she worked with, it’s totally possible that she was simply being misled as to its legality.  Then again, it is also entirely possible that Melania Trump committed visa fraud during her first several months in the US. It is not unheard of for people to come to the United States on   visas and then work while they’re here anyway.  In fact, the strict delineation of “work” and “ ” visas is a big problem for many people. Immigrant students can’t work while they’re on student visas, no matter how much they might need the extra money. Many immigrant spouses, meanwhile, are prevented from working in the US; one member of a couple may be here as a work visa holder but the other is here as a “dependent. ” That causes unnecessary economic difficulty and can also make immigrants feel isolated and useless. The scrutiny that Melania is facing, too, is incredibly common among immigrants and visa holders in the United States. They’re used to having every detail of their pasts raked over  —   and having any inconsistency or mistake held up as evidence of fraud. Usually, it’s at the hands of the federal government.  I’ve seen Immigration and Customs Enforcement prosecutors accuse asylum seekers of making up their entire stories, simply because they said at one point that something happened in 1993 and at another point that it happened in 1994. And most immigrants have even fewer resources to make their case than the Trumps do.    The problem isn’t Melania Trump  —   it’s a system that even Melania Trump can’t handle Ostensibly, the reason that Melania Trump’s immigration status 20 years ago is coming under such scrutiny today is that could be a political liability for her husband. He says illegal immigrants should all be deported  —   but his own wife perhaps once worked illegally in the United States. Yet Trump’s supporters tend to care less about an immigrant’s legal status than about whether she fits in with US culture and values. If they liked Melania before, knowing she was an immigrant, it’s not obvious that they’ll start freaking out about her now. Mocking Melania Trump’s immigration history is a lot like calling her husband “Donald Drumpf”  —   it seems like a devastating takedown, but it’s really not. What’s more interesting is the reaction of Trump’s critics. Scrutinizing Melania Trump’s records for evidence of her “illegality” actually reinforces one of the core assumptions that Trump and his supporters have about the immigration system: that it’s perfectly clear who’s “legal” and who’s not, and that if you’re violating immigration law it must be out of malice. Neither of those things is true.  Immigration law is incredibly hard to understand and even harder to comply with. That’s a very good reason not to pass laws that require government agents to be able to determine at a glance whether someone is “legal” or not  —   or deprive immigrants of a judicial hearing to sort out their status. In other words, it’s a good reason not to try to round up and deport all unauthorized immigrants in the US within a couple of years, as Trump has promised to do.   UPDATE: This article has been updated to include agent Pablo Zampolli’s claim that he got Melania Trump an   visa.       ",-1.0
"Trump’s nominees are right: The United States can’t go backward on torture.  IT HAS been widely observed that   Donald Trump’s national security nominees differed with his campaign positions during their confirmation hearings on a range of issues, from the threat of Russia and importance of NATO to the value of building a wall along the border with Mexico. To his credit, Mr. Trump seemed to approve of these departures, tweeting that “I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!” While it can be harmful for an administration to send conflicting messages to adversaries and allies, at this   stage, it is encouraging that the   appears ready to hear the different policies outlined by appointees such as Defense Secretary nominee James N. Mattis and John F. Kelly, the prospective secretary of Homeland Security  —   particularly as they appear to be tugging the administration toward more rational and centrist positions. Of these, none is more important than the stance on torture staked out by CIA   Mike Pompeo and Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions. During the campaign Mr. Trump repeatedly promised to use tactics “worse than waterboarding” on terrorist suspects, even though Congress has outlawed all interrogation tactics outside the Army’s interrogation manual, which conforms with international   conventions. As we pointed out at the time, Mr. Trump could try to get around the law by seeking a secret Justice Department legal ruling that it infringed on the president’s constitutional authority and then ordering the CIA to use harsher methods. It was therefore important then that when Mr. Pompeo was asked whether he would follow such an order, he responded “absolutely not,” adding that he had voted for the 2015 law  banning waterboarding as a member of Congress. Similarly, Mr. Sessions said that the law “makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture,” both for the military and for the CIA. While he said he had opposed making an Army field manual the standard for all agencies, Mr. Sessions said, “it is a law, and it needs to be enforced, absolutely. ”  Mr. Sessions and Mr. Pompeo were not the first to line up behind the torture ban. By Mr. Trump’s own account, Mr. Mattis made a strong pitch about the ineffectiveness of torture during one of their initial conversations. “I was very impressed by that answer,” Mr. Trump told the New York Times, though he added, “I’m not saying it changed my mind. ”  Whether he has changed his view or not, Mr. Trump has ensured through his national security appointments that any move to reinstate torture techniques will be stiffly resisted inside his own Cabinet. The statements by the nominees suggested the heartening conclusion that, despite the continuing political debate about the use of waterboarding and other “enhanced” interrogation methods during the George W. Bush administration, the nation’s military and intelligence establishments have learned the lesson from the enormous harm that resulted. The use of torture violated international law, badly tarnished the United States’ international image, and gave dictators and terrorists around the world an excuse to employ the same methods, including on Americans. Meanwhile, an exhaustive 2014 report by the Senate Intelligence Committee found the harsh methods yielded no valuable information. Mr. Trump did not live through those years as a commander, as Mr. Mattis did, and he has not had the exposure of Mr. Pompeo to the intelligence community. Having now appointed them to lead national security agencies, he will do well if he not only allows them to speak their minds, but also listens to them.

"The next big thing in American regional cooking: Humble Appalachia.        ‘It’s way easier to get drugs than a good greasy bean,” Travis Milton says, taking a deep drag on his cigarette. And that causes the chef a lot of headaches. For one, greasies are his favorite beans, whether you cook them   stewing them within an inch of their lives, or use a more modern technique such as steaming to show off the sweet, fat kernels inside. But the elusiveness of greasies (named for their slick appearance, not their taste) is more than just a personal problem for Milton. Later this year he will open Shovel and Pick, an Appalachian restaurant, in Bristol, Tenn. To turn out elevated versions of the dishes he grew up with  —   mulefoot pork with candied beets, root vegetables tossed in   miso  —   Milton needs traditional ingredients, like greasy beans, that are not easy to come by.  [Make the recipe: Sweet Potato ‘Casserole’]  And so this spring, Milton is sowing 10 acres with greasies and other heirloom beans, cowpeas, creasy greens (a type of field cress) Candy Roaster squash, goosefoot (an Appalachian cousin of quinoa) blackberries, huckleberries and more. What he doesn’t use at his restaurant he will pickle and preserve, or share with other chefs who also are committed to promoting Appalachian cuisine. It’s all part of Milton’s grand plan to use food to ignite economic development in the region and end, once and for all, the pervasive stereotype of Appalachians as a bunch of toothless hillbillies. No small feat, especially when the response to the term “Appalachian cuisine” is either “huh?” or an exaggerated   at the idea of another cadre of chefs trying to cash in on a regional cooking fad. In fact, Appalachian food has at least as much of a claim on “cuisine” as California (which no one would dare challenge). The foods of central Appalachia  —   a region that stretches from southern Ohio and West Virginia to Tennessee  —   constitute America’s own cucina povera, as rich and unexplored in the American culinary scene as Tuscan food was in the 1980s. William Dissen, a native West Virginian and owner of the Market Place restaurant in Asheville, N. C. calls it the “backbone of Southern cooking. ”     Travis Milton was one of six chefs on hand at the Appalachian Storytellers dinner. (Dhanraj Emanuel)     Elliott Moss’s cured and smoked pork tenderloin, served at the Appalachian Storytellers dinner. (Dhanraj Emanuel)    It’s a scrappy, intelligent way of cooking that, out of necessity, embraced preserving, canning, fermenting and using every part of the animal long before all that was trendy. There are leather britches, beans that are strung up whole to dry, then brought back to life with water and a smoky ham hock. There is vinegar pie, a mountain version of the South’s lemon chess pie, with vinegar providing the acid in place of expensive or    citrus. “There’s real beauty in these dishes,” says Milton. “They yield amazing flavors, the flavors of a subsistence culture. A humble pole bean tastes like a pot roast. You work with what you have because you have to eat. ” The idea is catching on. Last fall, scholars, chefs and activists hosted an Appalachian food summit in Abingdon, Va. to examine how the region’s food heritage can boost local economies. In February, the James Beard Foundation hosted its   salon for Appalachian chefs. (Full disclosure: This reporter served as a moderator at the event.) A few weeks later, the Blind Pig, an Asheville supper club, hosted Milton and five other chefs for a dinner called Appalachian Storytellers. Milton served smoked venison, drizzled with a sauce made of malted sassafras and black birch syrup, and smoked collard greens. Edward Lee, a chef in Louisville who also owns Succotash at the National Harbor, made pork schnitzel, a nod to the German presence in the region, that he coated with salt bread, a  ’s loaf that relies on natural leaveners in the air. The event hosted 140 people and sold out in a day.  ‘An original identity’ Ask most people what they think Appalachian food is, and their answer  —   if they have any idea at all  —   will probably be corn bread and pinto beans. Food that is cheap enough to fill a belly before a day in the coal mines and bland enough to suit the tastes of the   who settled the area. That, says Ronni Lundy, author of the forthcoming book “Victuals: An Appalachian Journey, With Recipes” (Clarkson Potter, August 2016) betrays a gross misapprehension about the region and its food, which is far more complex.     WASHINGTON, DC   MARCH 23: Name of Dish (Photo by Dixie D.   The Washington Post) (Dixie D.   The Washington Post)   [Make the recipe: Collard Leather Britches]  The Cherokee originally inhabited the area. Freed slaves congregated there because it was one of the few places they were permitted to live. The English and Germans arrived along with the   in the early 1800s, and Hungarians and Italians came after the Civil War to work in the mines. Some stayed for a generation or two and moved on, while some settled permanently. “Appalachia is more of a melting pot,” says Lundy. “That’s visible in our foodways. ” Take corn. It was first grown in Appalachia by the Cherokee; the tribe taught new settlers how to soak the kernels in water mixed with ash, then grind it to make a dough. Leather britches, also known as shuck beans, are also thought by many to be the product of a Native American drying technique, though Lundy says the method might have been brought over by the Germans, along with their passion for fermenting. Sauerkraut is common in many Appalachian households, but fermentation also was used on native beans and to make sour corn, a   dish. “You take an old technique, add a new ingredient and you get a totally original food,” Lundy says. But Appalachian cuisine is derived as much from the culture of the mountains as from its ingredients. Perhaps here more than in any region in the United States, families carefully saved seeds, preserving heirloom varieties that vanished quickly in areas where commercial seeds were widely available. In 2011, researchers at Slow Food’s RAFT Alliance documented 1, 412 distinctly named heirloom foods in the region, including more than 350 varieties of apples, 464 varieties of peas and 31 kinds of corn. Locals subsidized what they were able to cultivate with the bounty in the woods around them. And there is plenty to forage: Southern and central Appalachia are acknowledged as the most biodiverse regions in North America. Their ramps and wild mushrooms are famous. Less well known are plants such as wild ginger, which tastes of spearmint and black pepper; ginseng; sumac; and spicebush, a wild variety of allspice.    Chef Elliott Moss smokes pork tenderlion at Claxton Farms for the Appalachian Storytellers dinner. (Dhanraj   emanuel )   [Make the recipe: Smoked Venison]  The short growing season in the mountains put a focus on preservation of all kinds: smoked meats, pickled vegetables, fruit turned into jams and jellies. Many families were poor, so little was wasted. Denny Trantham, a division chef at U. S. Foods who cooked at the Appalachian Storytellers dinner, says his grandmother would make blackberry dumplings out of leftover biscuit dough and jam that hadn’t quite set. (He made it for the dinner exactly the way she would have, with one exception: He substituted   European butter for lard.) “This is an original identity,” says Trantham. “You can’t get it on Amazon. You have to have been a part of it. ”  ‘Taking the next step’ Milton grew up in Castlewood, a town of about 2, 000 in Southwest Virginia. His grandparents owned the Village Restaurant, which Milton describes as a little greasy spoon that served burgers,   gravy, country ham and shuck beans. Milton spent much of his childhood in the kitchen; when he was as young as 3, his mother would plunk him in a high chair and let him peel potatoes with a dull butter knife while she waited tables. In summer, he’d sit under a big oak tree in his grandparents’ yard and snap beans to be canned or dried. At family dinners, there were all the dishes that Milton now evangelizes: venison, sour corn, “kilt” lettuce (wilted with bacon grease) leather britches and creasy greens. There were always plenty of pickles, many of which showcased the mix of ingenuity and frugality in Appalachian cooking. (For example, Milton’s grandmother always added a few Red Hots candies to her pickled peaches in place of expensive cinnamon sticks.) For dessert, there were dumplings, pie and stack cake, a cake of as many as five layers slathered with apple butter.  When he was in his early teens, Milton’s family moved to Richmond. He worked on cars and as a radio DJ (  name: Albino Love Machine) and taught high school English before settling on cooking as a career. At 24, he landed his first job as a   at Bottega, an Italian restaurant in Richmond. He hadn’t gone to culinary school, so Milton used his vacations to apprentice at America’s top restaurants.    Elliott Moss’s pork tenderloin comes off the smoker. (Dhanraj Emanuel)  It was during a few days at   an   restaurant in New York, that Milton had an epiphany about cooking Appalachian food. He was making PB&J “tablets” when he mumbled aloud that all he really wanted was a greasy bean. “Why would you want a bean covered in grease?” another cook shot back. It was a turning a point. “I realized that I wanted to cook everything that I had tried to distance myself from: the [foods of the] hillbilly, the hick, the redneck,” he said. A few years later, Milton took a job at Comfort, a Richmond restaurant that showcases Southern cooking, where the owner gave him the freedom to experiment. He made Kentucky frogs’ legs and chicken wings glazed with Mountain Dew barbecue sauce. He also started making vinegars from all manner of things: turnip greens, honeydew melon, even Cheerwine, a North Carolina soda pop, which he in turn used to make cheeky vinegar pie. “Travis understands that you can’t extract the cuisine from the culture,” says John Fleer, the   of Rhubarb in Asheville and widely acknowledged as the one who ignited interest in mountain cuisine when he was chef at Blackberry Farm in eastern Tennessee. Fleer compares Milton to Sean Brock, who has become a powerful evangelist for Southern ingredients. “Travis is taking the next step. He’s giving cultural context to the stories of food. ”  [Sean Brock   Southern cuisine]  Milton looks like what hipsters try to emulate with their trucker caps,   glasses and burly beards. He is rarely without his Virginia Is for Lovers cap or a jean jacket covered with patches, including one of the Kellogg’s Corn Flakes logo and one of Paul Stanley of the band Kiss. And like many chefs these days, he has an arm full of tattoos. Among other things, there is a greasy bean, of course; a bunch of watermelon radishes; a stalk of rhubarb, which Milton used to munch on raw as a kid; and a German Johnson tomato, his grandfather’s favorite. Behind the Technicolor vegetables is a cloud of black. “It shows all the beautiful things coming out of coal country,” Milton says. “It’s not me wearing my heart on my sleeve. It’s my plan for Appalachia. ”     Chef Denny Trantham at the Appalachian Storytellers Dinner organized by Blind Pig Supper Club dinner at Claxton Farms, Weaverville NC ©dhanrajemanuel (Dhanraj   emanuel )     Mamaws Blackberry Dumplings with Fresh Cream & Mint by Denny Trantham ©dhanrajemanuel (Dhanraj   emanuel )    A return to salt Can food help ignite economic development in the twilight of coal? There are hopeful signs. Milton’s restaurant, which he hopes to open later this year, is one. There also are efforts to bring back authentic Appalachian products: heirloom apple orchards, which were razed for strip mining, to make cider; “ ” whiskey; and salt.  Yes, salt. Before timber, before coal, salt was the major industry in central Appalachia. Brine was drawn up from deep within the ground, the remnants of the Iapetus Ocean, which covered the region 470 million years ago. In 1846, West Virginia had more than 50 saltworks and was the largest   area in the country. One producer was J. Q. Dickinson. Founded in 1817, it was the last to close its doors, in 1945. Three years ago,   members of the family, Nancy Bruns and her brother Lewis Payne, reopened the saltworks along the Kanawha River, southeast of Charleston. They draw the brine from the same spots but have committed to a more   if less efficient, way of drying it. Instead of heating it with wood or coal fires, they place the brine in trays in a glass sunhouse and let it evaporate naturally. The result is a chunky, clean crystal that makes food pop. When Brock tasted it for the first time, he called Bruns and asked whether he could buy it by the truckload. Production remains limited, though. In its first year, J. Q. Dickinson turned out just 400 pounds of salt. This year, the company aims to make 14, 000 pounds. But that’s still a fraction of the 8, 000 pounds per day that was once produced. The revival of local salt was the focus of a film shown last month at the Appalachian Storytellers dinner. The crowd was a mix of pedigreed Appalachians and culinary    —   two necessary ingredients in Milton’s recipe to revive the region and its food. Treva Johnson, 78, grew up eating leather britches and creasy greens that she foraged with her grandmother. The dinner was an opportunity to taste them again. (The creasy greens, served as a puree on heirloom grits, didn’t quite match her memories. “It was wrong but also exciting,” she said.) Lisa Gamble, 35, had never heard of leather britches before the dinner. “Now,” she said, “I want to eat them every day. ”     Sweet Potato “Casserole,” Collard Leather Britches and Smoked Venison.

"Trump wants to ""totally destroy"" a ban on churches endorsing political candidates.  At his first National Prayer Breakfast on February 2, President Trump reiterated a campaign promise  —   to repeal the Johnson Amendment:    Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God. It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said the God who gave us life gave us liberty. Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?” Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs. That is why I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that. Remember. Contrary to Trump’s assertions, the Johnson Amendment doesn’t restrict the right of congregations to “worship according to our own beliefs. ” Instead, it prohibits registered 501( c)(3) organizations  —   which are   and include some religious congregations but also various other nonprofits, including organizations like the Clinton and Trump Foundations  —   from endorsing a candidate for public office and participating in political campaign activities. (Not all   organizations fall under the 501( c)(3) designation, but most do.) The president’s promise to “totally destroy” the amendment is consistent with his rhetoric throughout the campaign. And if he keeps it, it will have serious implications for campaigns in the future.    The Johnson Amendment repeal has consistently been one of Trump’s major promises to religious voters The promise seems to have been introduced on June 22 when Trump met with hundreds of evangelical leaders in a   meeting in New York City.     During that meeting, Trump made two promises to woo evangelicals:  The government has gotten so involved in your religion. Especially your religion, that it makes it very difficult. We’ll talk about that. Mike [Huckabee] and I have been discussing it, and I think we have some very important things to say. The next president  —   it’s going to be vital. Not only with Supreme Court justices, which we’ll also talk about at length. But also in things like freeing up your religion, freeing up your thoughts, freeing up your  …      You talk about religious liberty and religious freedom. You really don’t have religious freedom, if you really think about it, because when President Johnson had his tenure, he passed something that makes people very, very nervous to even talk to preserve their   status. It’s taken a lot of power away from Christianity and other religions.  I’ve seen it.   …     I said, “Why is it that the whole thing with Christianity, it’s not going in the right direction? It’s getting weaker, weaker, weaker from a societal standpoint?” And over the course of various meetings, I realized that there are petrified ministers and churches. They speak before 25, 000 people, the most incredible speakers you could ever see, better than any politician by far. And yet when it comes to talking about it openly or who they support or why they support somebody because he’s a person  —   a man or a woman  —   who is into their values, they’re petrified to do it. And I couldn’t get the answer. And then one day, at one of our meetings, somebody said, “They’re petrified of losing their   status. ” And I said, “What is that all about?” And they went into it. It was what happened during the Johnson administration. And I will tell you folks that some of you will agree, some of you will disagree, and some of you, it’s been ingrained and that’s the worst thing because you don’t even think about it. You can’t see the forest for the trees, some of you are so close to it. But I can tell you, I watched this during the last year, and I watched fear in the hearts of brave, incredible people. And we are going to get rid of that, because you should have the right to speak.     Here, Trump incorrectly says that Johnson passed the amendment while president. The amendment was passed by Congress in 1954, and Johnson, of course, didn’t serve as president until 1963. In 1954, Johnson was a senator, and he proposed this change to the tax code in part to keep certain   organizations from endorsing or opposing candidates during the McCarthy era.  This issue resurfaced in Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21, in which he talked about “an amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, [that] threatens religious institutions with a loss of their   status if they openly advocate their political views.” (We   his speech here.) Then in a   video that played in a number of evangelical churches on November 6, Mike Pence made a pitch to congregants for their vote, citing two main reasons to vote for his ticket: the promise to appoint justices to the Supreme Court “who will uphold our Constitution and the rights of the unborn”  —   in other words, someone with conservative views on religious freedom and abortion  —   and a promise to repeal the Johnson Amendment.            Here is how Pence describes it:    The Johnson Amendment has literally been on the books since the 1950s and it essentially threatens   organizations and churches with losing their tax status if they speak out against important issues facing the nation from the pulpit. Pence goes on to enumerate three moments in American history in which pulpits stood against tyranny: against King George III’s oppressive rule prior to the American Revolution, against the practice of slavery, and in favor of civil rights. It’s worth noting that there are plenty of examples of pulpits standing for said tyrannies as well, a matter Pence does not address. It’s also worth pointing out that the Johnson Amendment was passed during the early days of the civil rights movement, which complicates Pence’s third example as a reason to get rid of it. Pence’s video has been removed from Vimeo but can be viewed on YouTube, and as of this writing it has been watched nearly 220, 000 times. The Johnson Amendment doesn’t only target churches About a million and a half organizations in the US are registered as   many of which are 501( c)(3). Per the Johnson Amendment, an organization in that category “may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates. ”  As of May 2016, only 312, 373 of those organizations are congregations (this includes congregations of all religions). As the Internal Revenue Service interprets the Johnson Amendment,   organizations  —   those that fall under the 501( c)(3) designation  —   include those which are “religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, to foster national or international sports competition, or prevention of cruelty to children or animals organizations. ” Both the Donald J. Trump Foundation and the Clinton Foundation are 501( c)(3) organizations too.  But the Johnson Amendment has become a particular target of the   Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) a legal fund that litigates on behalf of conservative Christian causes. A blog post on the organization’s website mirrors Pence’s statement:    Historically, churches frequently spoke for and against candidates for government office. Such sermons date from the founding of the United States, including those against Thomas Jefferson for being a deist and sermons opposing William Howard Taft as a Unitarian. Churches have also been at the forefront of most of the significant societal and governmental changes in our history, including ending segregation and child labor, and advancing civil rights. The ADF argues that the amendment unconstitutionally restricts the First Amendment rights of pastors and churches (an argument that is disputed by others) as well as the free exercise clause in the Constitution, which states that Congress cannot make laws that keep people from freely exercising their religion.  The ADF’s blog post concludes on a surprising note: After the 1954 Johnson Amendment, churches faced a choice: speak freely on all issues addressed by Scripture and potentially risk their tax exemption, or remain silent and protect their   status. Unfortunately, many churches have silenced their speech, even from the pulpit. Ironically, after   years of the IRS strictly interpreting the amendment, there is no reported situation where a church lost its   status or was punished for sermons delivered from the pulpit. Nonetheless, the law remains unchanged and many churches remain silent due to the IRS’s interpretation of the amendment. That is, the Johnson Amendment has never actually been used to strip a congregation of its 501( c)(3) status.  Action has been considered at times, though. For instance, in 2014, Houston Mayor Annise Parker subpoenaed five sermons from churches in her city. After widespread outcry, Parker dropped the subpoena. Interestingly, this story is referenced in the successful 2016 Christian film God’s Not Dead 2 and teased as the probable plot for the inevitable God’s Not Dead 3.             The case in Houston, which rattled congregations across the country, makes it clear why clergy would be understandably reticent to submit their sermons for approval every week. And it’s easy to reason that this narrative is in the background of Trump’s interest in the law too.    But the argument to repeal the amendment rests on the idea that churches and other congregations are restricting their speech for fear of something that has never actually happened. And there are a few other misleading matters in arguments such as Pence’s, which rest on statements about the Revolution, slavery, and civil rights (even leaving aside Trump and the GOP’s handling of matters around race). As it’s practiced, the Johnson Amendment would never have kept clergy from preaching that slavery  —   the practice of one human owning another human  —   is a violation of God’s law. It would just keep them from endorsing Abraham Lincoln. And, again, using the civil rights as an example is strange, since the amendment was in place during the period when many influential church sermons on civil rights were delivered. The letter of the law also contradicts Trump’s statement at the National Prayer Breakfast that dismantling the amendment would make people more free to “worship according to their own beliefs. ” The fact that some churches did show the Pence ad is an indicator of the state of the Johnson Amendment. Under the IRS’s interpretation, 501( c)(3) organizations are allowed to provide a forum for candidates, which “is not, in and of itself, prohibited political activity,” so this may technically fall under that provision. (But without an accompanying voice from the Clinton campaign, this seems a bit blurry  —   especially with Pence’s hard sell for a Trump vote.) The proposed Johnson Amendment repeal has implications that stretch far beyond churches There are two interesting implications of this ongoing promise to abolish the amendment.     The first is that it articulates what the Trump’s administration thinks is important to the evangelical voter. The campaign correctly identified that issues around abortion and religious liberty, and their status on the Supreme Court, were a driving force behind many voters’ choice. Indeed, the nomination of Neil Gorsuch two days ago was a huge win for conservative voters who gambled on Trump. But while nearly 80 percent of Americans say they do not favor political endorsements in church, there remains a persistent belief among many Trump supporters, including his chief strategist Steve Bannon, that the influence of Christians on American culture is in decline, and that this must be counteracted. It seems Trump’s administration is attempting to propose concrete action on this, in at least one way, by suggesting that the Johnson Amendment is to blame for churches’ declining influence. At the meeting of evangelical leaders in June, Trump spoke further:  And I say to you folks, because you have such power, such influence. Unfortunately the government has weeded it away from you pretty strongly. But you’re going to get it back. Remember this: If you ever add up, the men and women here are the most important, powerful lobbyists. You’re more powerful. Because you have men and women, you probably have something like 75, 80 percent of the country believing. But you don’t use your power. You don’t use your power  …     You used to go to church, and you know, when I’d go there.   …     It’s much different today. I know, as an example, the young people aren’t going as much. But we have to bring that back. We have to bring those values back. We have to bring that spirit back. And in a way, it’s been taken away from you by the federal government and by these horrendous things that have been allowed in the past. But just remember this: You are the most powerful group in this country. But you have to realize that. You have to band together. You have to band together. If you don’t band together, you’re really not powerful. You have a powerful church. I see it. I see some of these incredible pastors and ministers and people that speak so brilliantly. And I see it. But they’re great within their audience, but then outside they don’t have it. You have to band together as a group. And if you do that, you will bring it back like nothing has ever been brought back.  Power, as the Trump campaign sees it, is the greatest good  —   and it’s what has been stolen from churches. The way to please churches is to bring power back.             The second implication is more difficult to parse: Because most 501( c)(3) organizations are not religious congregations, the abolishment of the Johnson Amendment would also lift restrictions on other nonprofit organizations with 501( c)(3) designations that wish to endorse a candidate. Universities and colleges, sports organizations, entities that promote scientific or literary causes, and (importantly) charitable foundations would be free to conduct activities that support a political campaign and endorse candidates. And because the Johnson Amendment prohibits “contributions to political campaign funds” too, there’s a chance that the repeal of the Johnson Amendment could create a way for these nonprofits to funnel funds and support into political campaigns and campaign activities.     The Johnson Amendment repeal is likely to remain a target of the Trump administration. The problem is there are broader consequences to repealing the amendment than those Trump has discussed, which could have serious impacts on political campaigns going forward  —   and the Trump administration has demonstrated itself to be unconcerned with legislating haphazardly.

"“President Bannon,” explained.  On Monday morning, President Donald Trump decided that there was an urgent matter he needed to clear up for the public. “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it,” he tweeted. “Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!”    It may seem odd that the president of the United States would feel compelled to remind the country that he is actually in charge. But over the past week and a half of Trump’s young presidency, a narrative has been gaining steam in the media and among political observers that it is not Trump but in fact White House chief strategist Steve Bannon who is actually running the show. In the wake of the chaos following Trump’s order banning entry into the US from nationals of seven   countries   —   and in the wake of reports that Bannon was the chief architect of the policy  —   the hashtag #PresidentBannon began to spread on Twitter, and images of Bannon as a puppet master pulling Trump’s strings became commonplace. A Saturday Night Live skit concluded an Oval Office session with its version of Bannon asking Trump for the president’s desk back, and Alec Baldwin as Trump responding, “Yes, of course, Mr. President. ”  Perhaps most prominently, Time magazine put Bannon on a striking cover and dubbed him “The Great Manipulator. ” Just whom he might be manipulating was left unstated.            MSNBC host Joe Scarborough cited the Time cover in a Morning Joe segment Monday as an example of how “this Steve Bannon thing just keeps coming up, people are saying ‘President Steve Bannon. ’” Scarborough added that it was very unusual for a White House staffer to develop such a high profile so quickly, and though he professed to believe that “Donald Trump is the final decider,” he said that other people keep wanting to hear about Bannon’s influence. (Trump’s “I call my own shots” tweet, which came less than an hour later, may have been a direct response to this exchange, and it also calls to mind President George W. Bush’s “I’m the decider” remark.)       For some, the “President Bannon” meme is useful as a deliberate attempt to annoy a president they view as   and egotistical. But while it’s surely going too far to say that Bannon is “the real president”  —   he does work for Trump and serve at his pleasure, after all  —   the chief strategist has indeed been remarkably influential in shaping the new administration so far. Not only are his fingerprints all over the most controversial parts of Trump’s immigration actions, but that same weekend Trump announced another order that gave Bannon a full seat on the National Security Council Principals Committee, which is unprecedented for a White House political adviser.   Furthermore, while the “powerful political aide skilled in the dark, manipulative arts” is a common trope, Bannon isn’t just any aide. His prominence is particularly noteworthy because there are indications that he is more   than Trump in certain ways. Where Trump has said he loves legal immigration, Bannon has called it a “problem. ” Where Trump has often been cozy with moneyed elites on Wall Street and in Hollywood, Bannon professes to despise them. Bannon has even predicted that the US will go to war in the South China Sea within five to 10 years.     Many liberals, and even many conservatives, therefore find Bannon’s apparent influence on Trump immensely disturbing. And that’s just the way Bannon likes it. 1) Who is Steve Bannon?             Stephen K. Bannon grew up in Virginia, served in the Navy, went to Harvard Business School, became a banker at Goldman Sachs, and eventually got very, very rich from a deal in which he got a share of royalties from the TV show Seinfeld. His wealth freed him up to pursue his own interests, first as a documentary filmmaker and then as a close associate of Andrew Breitbart, the conservative political activist who founded the website Breitbart News. After Breitbart himself died suddenly in 2012, Bannon took over the site as executive chair.  Under Bannon, Breitbart News filled a unique role in the conservative media ecosystem. The site was relentlessly critical of Obama and top Democrats, but also of top Republicans it portrayed as sellouts to powerful interests, like House Speaker Paul Ryan and his predecessor John Boehner. The site’s tone and editorial choices on racial matters are also the subject of major controversy  —   the site spotlights tales of lurid crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants, Muslims, and African Americans, and Bannon himself has called the site “the platform for the ” according to Mother Jones.    So when Trump launched his presidential campaign, the       rhetoric he used all sounded familiar to Breitbart readers. Under Bannon, Breitbart News’s coverage became staunchly  . Few then were surprised when, in an August 2016   Trump brought on Bannon as his campaign CEO  —   this was merely the formalization of an alliance that had already existed for many months. When Trump unexpectedly won the election, he decided to reward Bannon with a top White House job. (Josh Green wrote the definitive pre —  White House profile of Bannon, and Zack Beauchamp has a fuller explainer on the history of Bannon and Breitbart.) 2) Why would anyone get the idea that Bannon has a different agenda than Trump?             The idea that Steve Bannon might be manipulating Donald Trump to advance his own agenda doesn’t come out of nowhere  —   in fact, it comes from Bannon’s own lips. As late as summer 2016, when Bannon was still at Breitbart and just months before he moved to the Trump campaign, he told a journalist that Trump was a “blunt instrument for us” and said, “I don’t know whether he really gets it or not. ”  Who is the “us” there? Overall, Bannon sees himself, Breitbart, and now Trump as allies in what he calls a “global populist movement,” which is taking back the interests of “the people” against various malefactors like rapacious capitalists, open borders “globalists,” unauthorized immigrants, and radical Islamists. He’s the type of person who pontificates a lot about how “the   West” is under siege, and who thinks the US and many European governments are failing to appropriately defend the interests of people born there. The word Bannon has embraced to describe this movement is “nationalism. ” Indeed, he sees himself and Trump as embarking on a conscious project to demolish the old American political camps and “build an entirely new political movement,” he told Michael Wolff in November. ”I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” he continued. “It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution  —   conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.” According to the Daily Beast’s Ronald Radosh, Bannon gave an even more grandiose statement of his motivations a few years back. He called himself a “Leninist” because “Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment. ” (Bannon now claims he doesn’t remember saying this.) But despite Bannon’s denials, there are unmistakable racial and ethnic aspects to the movement he’s building, and critics argue “white nationalism” is in fact the key to his project. Bannon has often sought to drum up political support (in the form of either pageviews or votes) by mobilizing white Americans against various frightening “others”  —   whether they’re Black Lives Matter protesters, immigrants, or refugees.     Much of this fits quite well with Trump’s worldview. But Trump has also appointed many more traditional Republicans to his administration, and could conceivably be swayed toward more mainstream policies as a result. Bannon also seems to genuinely differ from Trump on a couple fronts. First, there’s sometimes a religious tinge to his rhetoric  —   he’s argued that “secularism has sapped the strength of the   West to defend its ideals,” and has even taken an interest in internal Vatican disputes. Second, while Trump says legal immigration is wonderful, Bannon views it as a “problem and thinks it needs to be cut back. ” This was dramatically demonstrated in an exchange the two had on Bannon’s radio show in November 2015, in which Bannon made the false claim that most Silicon Valley CEOs were from Asia and expressed his unhappiness with that. “A country’s more than an economy. We’re a civic society,” he said.  Not just illegal immigrants but immigrants in general, Bannon seemed to believe, were sapping America’s Americanness. In this, he goes further than Trump, but he’s in alignment with several other important figures in the new administration. Most prominent among these are attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and several former Sessions aides, including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller. Past public statements make clear that Bannon, Sessions, and Miller are all harsh critics of even legal immigration. In some tellings, they are frequently pitted against more traditional Republicans in administration disputes. 3) What is Bannon’s White House job?             It’s hardly unprecedented for a president to give a political adviser a top job, as George W. Bush did for Karl Rove and Barack Obama did for David Axelrod. But recent incoming presidents have tended to designate one chief of staff who is indisputably in charge.  Not Trump. In a November press release, the Trump transition announced that Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus would be chief of staff  —   but that Bannon would fill the newly created position of “chief strategist. ” Priebus and Bannon, the press release said, would work as “equal partners. ” And yet Kremlinologists couldn’t help noticing that Bannon’s name was listed first. Bannon, it should be noted, fits the stereotype of the sinister political adviser to a T  —  and even seems to revel in it. “Darkness is good,” he told Wolff. “Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. ” Note that Bannon said this after the election and his appointment to a top White House job. (These comments are why Saturday Night Live portrayed him as the Grim Reaper in its recent skit.)    But as chief strategist, Bannon is more than just a political adviser. He’s taken on a major role in policy and is, by most accounts, the leading force in crafting the Trump administration’s agenda  —   especially the series of White House —  issued executive orders with which Trump began his presidency. “Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump’s economic nationalism,” the New York Times’s Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman report. 4) So where did “President Bannon” come from?            As the transition proceeded, many top White House positions and Cabinet jobs went to traditional Republicans rather than   outsiders, suggesting to some observers that the steady hand of Priebus was at the helm and that the Trump administration might actually end up being surprisingly normal. That narrative exploded on January 27, Trump’s seventh full day in office. On that day, Trump issued the executive order meant to block all refugees, and nationals of seven   countries, from entering the US for several months. Chaos ensued. Hundreds of people who had been previously cleared to enter the US were detained at airports around the country or prevented from boarding their flights to the US at all. Shockingly, the administration initially applied the entry ban to green card holders too, even though many of them had lived and worked in the US for years. Thousands turned out to protest, even many Republicans started to criticize the order, and a series of lawsuits soon brought the policy to a screeching halt. The blame game that ensued during and after all this made clear the order was a Steve Bannon production. A set of reports described the order as crafted by Bannon and Miller with minimal input from the relevant agencies. One of its most objectionable features  —   the ban on entry for green card holders  —   was personally dictated by Bannon and Miller over the Department of Homeland Security’s objections, according to CNN’s Evan Perez and Pamela Brown. Furthermore, it turned out that Bannon had a starring role in the other executive action Trump signed alongside the immigration order that Friday. This order gave Bannon a permanent seat on the Principals Committee of the National Security Council, placing him among the president’s top foreign policy advisers  —   an unprecedented role for a political hand.     Thrush and Haberman report that Trump was angry afterward because he “was not fully briefed” on that order’s details, and that it was an even “greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. ” (However, Time’s Zeke Miller has his own source saying that Trump was in fact briefed on Bannon’s new role.) In any case, the reports on Bannon’s role in the immigration order converged with this NSC order, and the “President Bannon” meme was born, making him a sort of combination Dick   Rove figure in the minds of liberals. 5) What’s next for Bannon in the White House?              The fallout from the travel ban controversy has apparently led to Bannon being reined in somewhat. Both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post report Trump has clarified to his staff that Priebus is his top aide and that policy changes have to go through him and through a more rigorous vetting process.  By all accounts, though, Bannon remains very influential, and there’s no real talk of him being on the outs with Trump  —   not yet, at least. Indeed, Bannon and Trump have come a long way together. They share similar pugilistic instincts and a willingness to flout the political class’s conventional wisdom. Plus, it’s understandable if Trump places a great deal of stock in Bannon’s political instincts, since Bannon did oversee a campaign that put him in the White House despite the predictions of practically every expert. But Bannon will only continue to keep that influence if Trump is satisfied with how his presidency is going. And while the strategy of constantly throwing red meat to the base worked well to boost Breitbart News’s traffic numbers and to win Trump the election, it has not worked so well when it comes to governance. All it has done so far is earned Trump   job approval for a new president.  So at some point, Trump may have to decide whether holding on to the loyalty of Bannon’s movement is really enough. Perhaps he might decide he’d prefer trying to convert some new voters to his side. And if he does opt for that route, Steve Bannon may no longer be so useful to him. ",-1.0
"Someone paid random internet users to lobby for Betsy DeVos’s confirmation.  Someone out there really wants President Donald Trump’s polarizing nominee for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, to get the job  —   so much so that they’ve been paying random internet users to write notes supporting her contentious confirmation.    Users on paid task sites like InstaGC, Swagbucks, which reward users for shopping at certain websites or completing small tasks and surveys online, as well as ‘freemium’  mobile fashion game Covet Fashion, have been reporting a task that links to SupportDeVos. com. The website contains a contact form to get in touch with members of Congress  —   but only to send notes of support for DeVos’s confirmation. Users who fill out and send the support form earn points or actual cash, but there is no option to send a note of dissent.  Spokespersons for InstaGC as well as the company that runs Covet Fashion each confirmed that the ads recently appeared on their sites and have since been removed. The ads attempted to convince users they were paid for by the American Federation for Children, an organization funded and previously chaired by DeVos. But they weren’t. Spokespersons for DeVos and AFC confirmed to Vox that neither she nor the AFC had purchased the ads. Spokespersons for InstaGC and Covet Fashion each confirmed to Vox that the ads were paid for by advertisers using   vendors.     Recently, reports of the tasks appearing on various paid task and survey sites have been surfacing across the internet. On January 23, a Daily Kos user reported a task to support DeVos appearing on the website Swagbucks, where users could fill out the support contact form and earn “swagbucks,” or points that can be converted into cash or shopping discounts. On February 2, a Reddit user corroborated the existence of such a task on Swagbucks, while different Reddit user reported seeing a similar task on the task website InstaGC.         Covet Fashion is a ‘freemium’  mobile fashion game which allows users to gain virtual currency by doing side tasks. Covet Fashion user Alison McCollum told Vox that she was using the site on February 2 when she ran across a task offering a significantly   reward for notes of support sent through the SupportDeVos website.            “When I clicked on the offer, it did not give an option for picking [whether] to support or not,” McCollum said. It “simply asked for name, address, email, and zip code, then had a standard support email that they would send on your behalf to your representative. ”       A Swagbucks user who wished to remain anonymous also provided Vox with a screencap of the website   February 2. Visible is a task showing 26 “swagbucks,” a relatively high task amount, to send a note of support for DeVos.         Users of the paid task sites expressed serious reservations about the ethics of the tasks, with some wondering whether paid crowdfunded lobbying of this nature constitutes fraud. The tasks give the appearance of DeVos trying to pay for support of her own nomination. The SupportDeVos website states that it is paid for by the American Federation for Children (AFC) a nonprofit educational organization that DeVos chaired until late November, when she stepped down, according to an AFC press release, in order to pursue her nomination.     Despite appearances, however, a media consultant for AFC told Vox that the organization had not purchased the ads, and that the culprit was most likely a “bad actor” or “  marketer who’s hijacked a platform. ”  Representatives of Swagbucks could not be reached for comment. An InstaGC representative confirmed to Vox that paid tasks like these are “sometimes added automatically from advertisers we use,” and linked to a Facebook statement in which the company promises to quickly screen and remove similar ads in the future. The company also stated that it has “requested any incentive InstaGC was to receive for this promotion not be paid to us. ” In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Glu Mobile, which runs Covet Fashion, also confirmed the   theory and informed Vox that the task to support DeVos had been removed. The statement also noted that the developer was in the process of reviewing its vendors to remove any politically motivated ads: We understand that a recent offer may have been inappropriate; as such it has been removed at our request. Glu does not condone political content in its games and will be reviewing this policy with all of our ad vendors. In addition, Glu is currently in the process of vetting that all political campaigns are blacklisted across our other titles.  Tapjoy is one of the   vendors responsible for serving ads to Covet Fashion and other similar websites. The Covet Fashion spokesperson confirmed that Covet Fashion does not purchase individual ads from   vendors like Tapjoy; rather, vendors offer a “monetization platform,” including ads, that Covet Fashion integrates into its app.  The Tapjoy platform allows our users to participate in offers in order to gain more virtual currency that helps their game play, should they choose to do so. This is the way it works with many mobile games that integrate Tapjoy into their platforms. The offer appeared in our game via the Tapjoy integration, and was removed as soon as it was brought to our attention.    Vox made numerous attempts to contact Tapjoy without success. Given how much attention the DeVos ads garnered, it’s likely they won’t be the last of their kind. We might, instead, be seeing a disturbing new trend in which anonymous entities pay for public political support  —   a concept that seems likely to muddy the already blurry concept of what “grassroots support” looks like online.

"A huge moment for Clinton and Trump at first of three debates.  A roller coaster of a campaign 18 months in the making arrives Monday at a huge moment for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: a   debate, with much of the nation expected to tune in amid great uncertainty about what they’ll see. Virtually tied in recent national polls, both Clinton and Trump enter the debate as the two most deeply unpopular presidential candidates in modern history. Both hope to discredit the other, and both hope to emerge from the debate having burnished the public’s view that they are better qualified to be commander in chief. A roiling disagreement over the role of the debate moderator flared up Sunday, with Democrats arguing that a more activist “ ” role is needed to rein in Trump’s   pattern of factual misstatements. But Janet H. Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that “it’s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica. ” She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday’s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit. Underscoring the unique nature of the combatants, Clinton’s debate preparations included a focus on Trump’s personality as well as the substance of what will be discussed onstage at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N. Y. according to several Democrats with knowledge of her campaign’s approach.     These six moments from the 2016 primary debates have the context you need before you see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump go    in the first general election debate Sept. 26 (Sarah   Washington Post)   Clinton’s team convened a meeting last month at which longtime aide Philippe Reines, the   for Trump in her mock sessions, deeply studied Trump’s personality to be able to parry with her as Trump might. The meeting was one of several during which Clinton aides conferred for hours with outsiders who had been asked to offer advice about Trump’s temperament, according to people familiar with the gathering. The objective was to understand how a man who has spent most of his life in the business world and prides himself on being a dealmaker might behave in a debate setting. The stakes Monday could hardly be higher for both candidates. A new Washington   released Sunday shows likely voters split nationally 46 percent for Clinton and 44 percent for Trump, with Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson at 5 percent and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1 percent.  [Poll: Clinton, Trump in virtual dead heat on eve of first debate]  With barely six weeks remaining until Election Day, Clinton’s camp  —   after a prolonged focus on trashing Trump  —   sees the debate as a chance for her to present what she actually hopes to accomplish as president and to ease voters’ deep concerns about her likability and trustworthiness. For Trump, his first    presidential debate offers an opportunity to demonstrate a command of the issues and to persuade voters clamoring for change that he is a credible alternative, his advisers say. One of the biggest unknowns remains which Donald Trump will show up. While Clinton has a lengthy record of meticulous preparation and formidable performances, Trump has been more unpredictable. Sometimes, he is the freewheeling showman prone to controversial utterances; other times, with help from his campaign team’s repackaging, he is a more sober and scripted candidate.     Here’s your chance to choose the debate questions View Graphic     Here’s your chance to choose the debate questions  The first of three scheduled debates between Clinton and Trump is likely to have a full agenda. It comes amid heightened fears of terrorism, unrest over police shootings of African American men and a slew of   issues that sharply divide the   candidates, including immigration, trade, tax policy and foreign affairs. Supporters of Clinton and Trump, including their running mates and campaign managers, fanned out across the Sunday television shows to put their spin on the tasks ahead and seek some psychological advantage. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, seemingly acknowledged on CNN’s “State of the Union” that her candidate was trying “to get into the head of Hillary Clinton” when he suggested Saturday on Twitter that he had invited Gennifer Flowers, who has claimed to have conducted a   affair with Bill Clinton, to attend the debate. Trump’s tweet followed news that rival billionaire Mark Cuban, who supports Clinton, would be sitting in the front row. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, later said categorically on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Flowers would not be there. In their TV appearances, Clinton partisans said she has multiple goals Monday. Those include reminding voters of her long record of championing the interests of children and families and touting her agenda for helping the middle class  —   but also holding Trump accountable for assertions that independent   have labeled false. “She has a challenge because Donald Trump inveterately says things that aren’t true,” Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press. ” “She’s got to be able to make that positive case but also not let Donald Trump get away with what he’s likely to do, which is to make stuff up. ” Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Clinton’s running mate, said he expects the format to explore the truthfulness of both candidates’ claims. “There’s a real opportunity to hear somebody say something and then get into whether is that actually true or not,” Kaine said on “Face the Nation. ” Trump’s team continued to press its case Sunday that   shouldn’t be the responsibility of the moderator, however. “I really don’t appreciate campaigns thinking it is the job of the media to go and be these virtual   and that these debate moderators should somehow do their bidding,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos. ” She also disputed the notion that Trump makes more frequent misstatements, saying Clinton’s “casual relationship with the truth is   to Americans. ” Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, said he believes the moderators should remain a “modest” presence in the debates. “They’re not running for president,” Gingrich said on “Fox and Friends Sunday. ” “It’s pretty stupid to think we’re going to have this third candidate called the moderator, and that they’re going to   Donald Trump. ” Brown, the head of the independent debate commission, did not issue a verdict on the controversy during an appearance on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” but said that in the past, the role of the moderator has been to keep things moving and allow the candidates to call one another out for misstatements. Clinton’s camp also continued efforts of recent days to argue that the press and public shouldn’t hold her to a higher standard than Trump because of Clinton’s longer record in public service and   policy proposals as a candidate. “I’m very concerned that Donald Trump will be graded on a curve,” Clinton’s campaign manger, Robby Mook, said on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “Just because he doesn’t fly off the handle in the middle of this debate does not mean that he is prepared to be president of the United States. . . . He needs to roll out specific plans about how he’s going to make life better for Americans. ”  [What can we expect from Clinton and Trump in the debate?]  Aides to Trump, whose preparations by all accounts have been less meticulous than those of Clinton, are hopeful that the debate will help close what polls have shown to be a credibility gap with Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator from New York and first lady. As part of an effort to appear more disciplined in recent weeks, Trump has put an emphasis on new policy proposals, which were sparse during the primary season, and on reining in his freewheeling style at campaign rallies. It remains to be seen whether those efforts will be maintained throughout Monday’s 90 minutes on stage. “A victory for Donald Trump tomorrow night is answering the questions and showing America that he’s ready to be president and commander in chief on Day One,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week. ” Trump surrogates also sought to raise expectations for Clinton’s performance, talking at length Sunday about her public service while repeatedly stating that Trump has never participated in a    debate. “The expectations on Hillary are very, very high,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, on “Fox News Sunday. ” “She’s been doing this for 30 years. I think people expect her to know every detail. . . . He’s never run before, let alone been in a presidential debate. ” Trump’s biggest challenge might be staying on message, as the episode over Flowers’s possible appearance at the debate demonstrated. Heading into the debate, Trump’s tweet on the subject not only risked distracting from the candidate’s message but could further alienate women voters, with whom Trump has struggled. On Sunday, Pence said that the real estate developer was just joking. “Gennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday. ” Conway, speaking on CNN, said that Trump has no plans to bring up Bill Clinton’s marital indiscretions during the debate, saying viewers “deserve and expect these candidates to be talking about the issues. ” But, she added: “I’m not going to reveal what we have been doing in our debate conversations. But the fact is that he has every right to be defend himself. ” Clinton aides, meanwhile, argued that the episode was a telling one about Trump. “You saw his reaction, which is to do his favorite sport, which is to dive in the sewer and go for a swim,” Podesta said on NBC. “He’s kind of predictable: When you poke him a little bit, and he comes back and attacks whoever is doing it. ”  ",-0.5
"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are getting divorced. Leave Jennifer Aniston out of it..  The biggest and most surprising celebrity divorce of our time is upon us: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are, according to TMZ, getting divorced.    The shock you might feel is understandable. They’re two movie stars who have become pop culture’s shorthand for true love. They have supported each other through moments that are terrifyingly real. They have six children. There’s no doubt this is a big and unique story that speaks to the way we consume celebrity culture and translate it into our own lives. But there’s a common reaction to the news of Pitt and Jolie’s split that goes beyond Pitt and Jolie in a disturbing way: People are using the couple’s divorce to celebrate Jennifer Aniston. Aniston was married to Pitt from 2000 to 2005, and in their last year of marriage, Pitt met his future wife Jolie on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The narrative that emerged in the media painted Jolie as a husband stealer and declared Aniston had lost the most crucial component of her life.    Jennifer Aniston has become an avatar for Brangelina schadenfreude The news of Brangelina’s divorce has become a way for people to declare that Aniston has been vindicated, that she is smugly satisfied, or that she saw the whole thing coming. Aniston is trending on Twitter, despite people frequently misspelling her last name with two N’s.    Jennifer Aniston has become an avatar for Brangelina schadenfreude. Mentioning Aniston in the context of Pitt and Jolie’s divorce may seem harmless and fun, since there’s some kind of   to the whole thing, but it’s also a brutal reminder of the sexist way that Aniston has been treated since she and Pitt divorced.    Many people have framed Pitt and Jolie’s divorce as just the latest development in an ongoing rivalry between Aniston and Jolie. It perpetuates the notion that women are catty and there’s a good side and bad side to be on. Back in 2005, there was a period when people actually invested in ”Team Jolie” or ”Team Aniston”  . That sentiment resurfaced again in recent years, when Aniston began dating actor Justin Theroux. When Aniston and Theroux married in 2015, writer Kevin Fallon quipped in the Daily Beast that it ”was the happiest day in the history of all media,” because the ”world’s foremost sad single lady” finally had a husband again. There’s also the unshakable reality that no matter what Aniston does, her life is punctuated by and attached to what’s going on with her  .    Earlier this summer, Aniston wrote a column for the Huffington Post about how she is constantly hounded about whether she’s pregnant. A huge part of this speculation has been fueled by the rumor that she and Pitt divorced because she didn’t want to have children and he did. Aniston wrote that she was fed up with the way she’s been treated, and with ”the objectification and scrutiny we put women through.” She lamented how much we tend to define a woman’s value ”based on her marital and maternal status.” ”If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues,” Aniston wrote. ”The sheer amount of resources being spent right now by press trying to simply uncover whether or not I am pregnant points to the perpetuation of this notion that women are somehow incomplete, unsuccessful, or unhappy if they’re not married with children.” Imagining Aniston’s happiness has become a national pastime. People have devoted countless hours and resources  —   magazine stories, silly   conversations  —   to it. It’s become too easy to try to dictate the particulars of Aniston’s happiness  —   and to define her by the events of her  ’s life. What’s harder, it seems, is imagining this divorce between Pitt and Jolie as something that Aniston has nothing to do with. ",-1.0
"American policing is broken. Here’s how to fix it..  When a Baltimore police shift commander created an arrest form for loitering on public housing, he didn’t even try to hide his racist expectations. In the template, there was no space to fill in gender or race. Instead, that information was automatically filled out: “black male. ”    This attitude was not exclusive to one cop in Baltimore. A Justice Department investigation conducted in 2015 and 2016 found black people in Baltimore were much more likely to be stopped than their white counterparts even after controlling for population. One black man in his   was stopped 30 times in less than four years  —   nearly one stop a month  —   despite never receiving a citation or criminal charge. And these were just some of the many alarming findings of racial bias in the Baltimore Police Department that were unearthed by the Justice Department’s investigation. By the end of it all, the Justice Department found Baltimore police consistently violated at least three amendments in the US Constitution  —   the First, Fourth, and 14th  —   and engaged repeatedly and persistently in a pattern of racial bias.           The tyranny of a traffic ticket: How small crimes turn fatal for poor, minority Americans   “Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD’s enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force,” the report concluded. “These racial disparities, along with evidence suggesting intentional discrimination, erode the community trust that is critical to effective policing. ”    It would be one thing if this were just a particularly bad police department in the US. But when you zoom out to look at all the investigations the Justice Department has done over the past several years, typically after protests ignite due to a police shooting perceived as unjust, a pattern emerges: Whether it’s Baltimore; Cleveland; New Orleans; Ferguson, Missouri; or, most recently, Chicago, the Justice Department has found horrific constitutional violations in how police use force, how they target minority residents, how they stop and ticket people, and virtually every other aspect of policing. These issues come up time and time again, no matter the city that federal investigators look at.    One is left with just one possible conclusion: Policing in America is broken. Many Americans seem well aware of this: The statistics show that many simply don’t trust the very people who are supposed to protect them. But there are essentially two worlds  —   black and white  —   for police trust.     A 2016 Pew Research Center survey found, for instance, that black people are less than half as likely to trust the police as their white counterparts. When asked whether police treat racial and ethnic groups equally, 75 percent of white people said cops do an excellent or good job in this area, while just 35 percent of black people said the same. And 75 percent of white people said police do a good or excellent job using the right amount of force for each situation, while just 33 percent of black people did. Meanwhile, statistics show police are arguably failing to protect residents in black communities: While black people made up about 13 percent of the population in 2015, they made up more than half of reported murder victims. Thomas Abt, a criminologist at Harvard University, put it in stark terms: “In addition to all of these burdens that we’re placing on   communities in terms of aggressive policing, we’re fundamentally failing them at keeping them safe. ”    So I set out to find out how, exactly, policing in America can be fixed. I spoke to nine veteran policing and criminal justice experts across the country, with a focus on the big question: How should police and lawmakers address complaints of racial bias while making sure communities are effectively policed for crime? Based on what I heard from experts, I nailed down eight big policy ideas. These ideas could be done even under a Trump administration that fashions itself as “tough on crime”; almost all policing is done at the local and state, not federal, level  —   out of the nearly 18, 000 law enforcement agencies in America, only a dozen or so are federal. And the ideas are not in any specific order, but experts consistently said that nothing else will work if the first step on this list isn’t fully embraced by law enforcement across the US. 1) Police need to apologize for centuries of abuse            Time and time again, I heard the same thing from several experts: Until police own up to how minority communities view them, they won’t be able to effectively police their communities.  Some police officers might feel many of the criticisms are unfair. Some might hear about the history of police being used on slave patrols, and feel that they are wrongly blamed for things they weren’t even alive for. Some might feel that they are good cops, and it’s only a few officers who are bad. But that doesn’t matter. The reality is minority communities distrust police. That sentiment is based on a long history of   racist policing in America, even if it doesn’t apply to every single officer or department today. Until police acknowledge that, they will be perceived by many people as trying to cover up a long history of oppression. David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College, argued that there will always be distrust between police and black communities until cops own up to historical abuses, mimicking what a police chief might say to a community: “We recognize these facts  —   whether we were there or not, whether we were around during slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, attacks on the civil rights movement, or whether it’s more recent things that we have done that you have found disrespectful and untoward, like   policing and high levels of stop and frisk. ”    “In order to overcome lack of trust and confidence, the police have to make contact” So how can police repair this? For one, experts said police need to undertake a big effort  —   through community meetings, going door to door, their daily patrols, and TV appearances  —   to get their communities aligned with how policing should be done. “In order to overcome lack of trust and confidence, the police have to make contact  —         contact  —   with members of their community,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. “The police will be rebuffed on occasion, but that’s the only way I see to, in the long run, rebuild trust or, really, build it for the first time in the police in members of these communities. ” Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, likened the potential process to South Africa’s   Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Throughout those hearings, investigators spoke candidly with the victims and enforcers of apartheid about what happened. Much of the hearings were televised. In doing this, people not only got to air their grievances and see their concerns heard, but plans were also set in place  —   including reparations  —   to help undo the damage that had been done. Above all, the point is to let communities know that police hear them, are taking what they say seriously, and are planning further steps to address their complaints. 2) Cops should be trained to address their racial biases            Out of all the complaints leveled against the police, the biggest one in recent years  —   echoed by the Black Lives Matter movement  —   is that police are racially biased. Sometimes the cause is explicit racism  —   such as in North Miami Beach, Florida, where police officers used mug shots of black people as target practice. But other times, such biases may occur at the implicit level, where people’s subconscious biases guide their choices even when they’re not fully aware of it.    Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor, tested police for racial biases through a shooting simulation. His initial findings showed officers generally did a good job of avoiding shooting unarmed targets of all races. But when shooting was warranted, officers pulled the trigger more quickly against black suspects than white ones. This suggests that officers exhibit some racial bias in shooting. In the real world, this could lead police to shoot black people at disproportionate rates. Real policing situations, after all, are often much more complicated: Factors  —   such as a real threat to the officer’s life and the chance that a bullet will miss and accidentally hit a passerby  —   can make the situation much more confusing to officers. “In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,” Correll previously told me, “we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them. ” That’s one of the reasons there are racial disparities in police use of force: An analysis of the available FBI data from 2012 by Vox’s Dara Lind found black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population.            It’s not just individual biases driving the disparities, but structural problems as well. As a result of years and years of racial segregation, economic and educational inequality among people of different races, concentrated poverty in minority communities, and the criminal justice system’s neglect of crimes against minorities, there tends to be much more crime in black neighborhoods. So police are deployed more often in these areas, where they’re then more likely to shoot and kill someone. But higher crime in minority communities doesn’t fully explain the disparities. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found “there is no relationship between   racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even   crime rates). ” That suggests something else  —   such as, potentially, racial bias  —   is at work.     Phillip Atiba Goff, a criminal justice and racial bias expert at John Jay College, told me, this isn’t about whether officers are all evil racists. Instead, this is a bias that has been found time and time again in just about everyone. If you are a human being, chances are you have some level of bias  —   based on race, gender, religion, and so on. But American media and culture, with their constant depictions of black people as criminals, have shaped Americans’ biases into consistently associating black people with criminality. “The issue of police bias starts with the thing law enforcement is hiring, which is that they hire humans,” Goff said. “They end up being at least as biased as the rest of the population. And in some instances, I suspect, it may be even slightly more in terms of racial bias. ” For police, the bias can be particularly bad: They are constantly put in situations where they have to think quickly. And that makes it much more likely that their biases will take over. As Goff told me, “If I could put you in the right situation, I could get that particular association to lend itself to certain kinds of behaviors. ” Officers can be trained to help combat their biases. Lorie Fridell, a University of South Florida criminologist who works with cops to help them resist their biases, previously explained that cops can be taught to force themselves to focus on factors that aren’t skin color  —   such as body language and what a person is holding. Unfortunately, that training is rarely emphasized by police departments.  A 2006 report from the Justice Department found that police officers typically receive about 111 hours on firearms skill and    —   but just 11 on cultural diversity and human relations, eight on community policing strategies, and eight on mediation and conflict management.            This doesn’t speak just to how little police are trained to handle racial biases, but also all sorts of other situations they take part in  —   mental health crises, interactions with the LGBTQ community, and domestic and sexual abuse cases, as a few examples. Cops just aren’t   to handle a wide variety of sensitive, difficult areas.    If police want to renew community trust, this needs to change. It likely wouldn’t solve all problems  —   racial bias, for one, is likely to be present to some degree no matter how well cops are trained. But it would help. 3) Police should avoid situations that lead them to use force            Often, the error that leads to an unnecessary shooting  —   and perhaps bias as a driving factor of the excessive force  —   comes long before an officer pulls out his or her gun. It can happen when an officer decides to approach a scene in a certain way. Think of the final moments of before a Cleveland police officer shot and killed    Tamir Rice in 2014. In that tragedy, officers suspected that Rice, who was black, had an actual firearm, when he was in fact playing with a toy gun. And officers drove right into the park where Rice was playing, shooting the boy within two seconds of getting out of their squad car. What if officers had, instead of driving into the scene, parked further away, surveyed the area, and walked into the park more slowly, while giving warnings to Rice? It’s of course impossible to say what the outcome would be  —   but it certainly seems much more likely that Rice would be alive today. “We talk about the   decisions that have to be made when deadly force is used, and it’s a red herring,” Goff said. “Most of the time, [police] are not ambushed in a corner and then they have to figure out what to do. Most of the time, what happens is there are a number of tactical decisions you’ve made up until that point that have compromised your safety. ”    “We have to be able to acknowledge and identify the set of situations that are most likely to facilitate biased behavior” So if officers have racial biases, and you put them in an intense situation in which they have little to call on but their own biases, those biases are going to guide their actions. “We have to be able to acknowledge and identify the set of situations that are most likely to facilitate biased behavior,” Goff said. “And we want to be able to disarm or interrupt them. ” Goff gave an example from research work he did in Las Vegas. There, police established a foot pursuit policy that said the officer who was giving chase should not be the first person to put their hands on the suspect, with coordinated backup instead arriving on the scene and taking on that role. The idea is that foot pursuits often ended in excessive use of force  —   after all, they are   chases in which the officer and the suspect can get really angry, really fast. So by limiting, when possible, chasing officers from putting their hands on the suspect, Goff figured you could limit use of force. The change appeared to work. There was a 23 percent reduction in total use of force and 11 percent reduction in officer injury over several years, on top of reducing racial disparities, according to Goff. “Safer for the officer, safer for the suspects,” he said. “I didn’t have to talk about race to reduce a disparity that has racial components to it,” he added. “I had to change the fundamental situation where police are chronically engaging with suspects. And that’s the kind of example that I’m talking about how you interrupt the biases of life. ” This is just one example. More broadly, police need to stop being deployed in a way that is particularly aggressive against minority communities  —   such as when cops in New York City effectively targeted people of color and their whole communities through “stop and frisk. ” As Jonathan Blanks, a research associate focused on policing issues at the Cato Institute, told me, “So long as you have [racially disparate policing strategies] you can have all these ideas about how we’re going to measure how many black people we stop and reduce bias there, but I don’t think it’s really going to work. ”  4) Officers must be held accountable in a very transparent way            With the above steps, police can avoid more unnecessary uses of force. But there’s another problem: When police do use excessive force or engage in other types of misconduct, there needs to be more transparency and accountability in the aftermath.    The most   policy for this is the adoption of body cameras. Over the past couple of years, advocates have pushed police departments to equip all their cops with cameras that will record nearly every move. The cameras are crucial because video can help eliminate some of the doubt  —   for the police and civilians  —   as to what happened in, for example, a shooting.  Take the 2015 police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. An officer, Michael Slager, claimed that Scott had tried to take his stun gun and use it on him before fleeing. Video footage from a civilian at the scene, however, revealed that Scott had not tried to grab Slager’s stun gun, and Slager had shot at Scott’s back as the    black man very slowly attempted to flee. And after the shooting, Slager then planted the stun gun near Scott’s dead body  —   presumably to give his story credibility. If the cellphone video from the passerby didn’t exist, would Slager have been charged with murder and civil rights violations? Would he have been fired? Would he have gotten away with a totally unjustified shooting? After all, without video, witness testimony may have been limited to Slager’s own account.     Beyond changing the gear that officers wear, some experts argued that police leaders need to embrace a fundamental shift in accountability and transparency. As it stands, police departments are mired in secrecy  —   making it nearly impossible in some cases to find out if an officer has, for example, been disciplined in the past. In a 2015 investigation, Robert Lewis, Noah Veltman, and Xander Landen of the New York public radio station WNYC talked to attorneys and experts in all 50 states and Washington, DC, and reviewed laws and court cases to find out which states restrict police disciplinary records. They found that 23 states and DC make the records confidential. And 15 other states limit access to records by, for example, only letting the public see examples of severe discipline, such as suspension or termination. The remaining 12 states generally open police disciplinary records to the public.       (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   Much of this secrecy is ingrained in police culture. The “blue wall of silence” tells cops to stay quiet about other officers’ misconduct. This code is enforced both formally and informally. In Baltimore, for example, the Justice Department found a black sergeant was told to “stay in your lane” when he tried to flag misconduct within the police: In 2014, a BPD lieutenant placed several signs next to the desk of an   sergeant with a reputation for speaking out about alleged misconduct in the Department. Among the signs were warnings to ”stay in your lane,” ”worry about yourself,” ”mind your own business! !” and ”don’t spread rumors! !!” After the sergeant filed a complaint about the signs, the lieutenant admitted to creating them and placing them next to the sergeant’s desk. Yet BPD took no meaningful corrective action. Though the complaint was sustained, the lieutenant received no suspension, fine, or loss of benefits.  To fix this, then, some experts argue that a fundamental shift in leadership is needed. “The work that needs to be done certainly involves progressive leadership,” said Thomas Nolan, a Boston police veteran and criminologist at Merrimack College of Massachusetts. “We’ve seen, unfortunately, too little of that. We seem to see the same types of people  —   and there are exceptions  —   being put in chief executive positions in police departments across the country. ” Policing in America, particularly at the leadership level, tends to be quite insular. For example, William Bratton served as the police commissioner in Boston in the early 1990s, commissioner in New York City in the   chief in Los Angeles in the 2000s, and finally as commissioner again in New York City from 2014 to 2016. Anthony Batts similarly served as police chief in Oakland and Long Beach, California, before moving to the Baltimore Police Department from 2012 to 2015. There are many more similar examples in big and   cities’ police departments. Nolan’s argument is simple: If the same people tend to be in charge of police agencies, how can we expect them to change to be more transparent?    5)    incentives for police officers need to change            As part of changing the culture of transparency and accountability, several experts also argued that the incentives many police departments across the country impose on their officers need to change. The most commonly cited example comes from Ferguson, Missouri  —   where Michael Brown’s death by police in 2014 effectively launched the modern Black Lives Matter protests. The Justice Department investigated the Ferguson Police Department as a result of the protests. It found that police were encouraged to ticket as many people as possible with the explicit goal of raising as much revenue as possible from fines and fees. But to do this, police targeted the most vulnerable  —   mainly, black residents  —   with frivolous charges. The Justice Department cited one example: Officers frequently arrest individuals under Section  (1) on facts that do not meet the provision’s elements. Section  (1) makes it unlawful to ”[f]ail to comply with the lawful order or request of a police officer in the discharge of the officer’s official duties where such failure interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance of such duties.” Many cases initiated under this provision begin with an officer ordering an individual to stop despite lacking objective indicia that the individual is engaged in wrongdoing. The order to stop is not a ”lawful order” under those circumstances because the officer lacks reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.   …     Nonetheless, when individuals do not stop in those situations, FPD officers treat that conduct as a failure to comply with a lawful order, and make arrests. This is not exclusive to Ferguson. In New York City, a group of police officers tried to sue the city and police department over a “quota” to stop and arrest as many people as possible. Some officers acknowledged that officers met this incentive by targeting   black neighborhoods with little political power. “When you put any type of numbers on a police officer to perform, we are going to go to the most vulnerable,” Adhyl Polanco, one of the New York City police officers, told WNBC. “We’re going to [the] LGBT community, we’re going to the black community, we’re going to go to those people that have no boat, that have no power. ”    Experts say that police can still be incentivized for productivity, but that can be done without focusing so much on specific numbers of arrests or traffic tickets. It can be done in a more subjective manner through direct supervision. It can also be coupled with other types of data, such as the number of complaints leveled at an officer and how many times a particular cop used force. But the bottom line is police need to be aware of how strict quotas and incentives can lead officers astray  —   and take steps to correct any of those unwanted side effects. 6) We need higher standards for police  —   and better pay for cops            Who becomes a police officer likely needs to change, as well  —   by setting a higher bar for who can qualify for the job. There are no federal standards for police officers. Federal lawmakers could establish such guidelines, allowing states to treat them as the bare minimum or even expand on them. States could also individually up their licensing requirements for police. For example, in Florida, barbers are required under state law to have more training than police: Barbers need to log 1, 200 hours, while cops need 770. It’s just one state, but it exemplifies how poor the standards can be for police licensing across the US. Then there are other considerations, such as whether cities and states should require a college degree for cops  —   something that isn’t required in much of the country right now.     But generally, experts say there should be strong requirements in place that can check for the skills and characteristics we expect of police before they’re put in a live situation. “We need to think seriously about paying these guys better” “We want to recruit people who have the capacity for emotional regulation  —   so they don’t get angry, they don’t see authority challenges as personal challenges, they don’t fall on use of force as the first response to a challenge to their authority,” said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist at Columbia University. “We want people who are good at planning and thinking ahead. We want people who have a capacity to reflect on their own work and update their own work  —   in other words, learn from their mistakes. ” But, Fagan added, “In order to do that, we need to think seriously about paying these guys better. ” This is the rub: Higher standards will almost certainly lead to a need to pay cops more. Otherwise, why would someone with, say, a college degree take a job as a police officer when he or she can get far more pay at a private security firm? John Roman, a criminal justice expert at the University of Chicago, agreed: “I think we should have higher standards. And if you’re going to have higher standards, you’re going to have to pay them better to attract   people. That’s just the way the free market works. ” 7) Police need to focus on the few people in communities causing chaos and violence            Along with all these changes, police can also take steps that explicitly go after crime while limiting who’s impacted by policing actions.  The vast majority of crime in communities is perpetrated by just a few people in a few specific parts of the city. As Abt, the Harvard criminologist, recently wrote for Vox, “In most cities across the nation, 3 to 5 percent of city blocks account for 50 to 75 percent of all shootings and killings, with 1 percent of a city’s population responsible for 50 to 60 percent of all homicides. ” If police focus on just these few blocks  —   through policing strategies known as “  policing” and “focused deterrence”  —   they can stop and deter a lot of crimes in their cities.  Focused deterrence in particular has been hugely successful: Study after study backs it up, and the method got much of the credit for the “Boston miracle” that saw the city’s violent crime rate drop by 79 percent in the 1990s. Rosenfeld of the University of Missouri in St. Louis explained the two prongs of focused deterrence: “We clearly know who you are, where you live, and we’re going to do everything we can to stop the violence in this community  —   and if that means that we arrest and charge you with a serious violent crime, we’re going to do that. If you want out of this life, then, secondly, here are services and support that you might find useful to set a different direction of your life. ” “In most cities across the nation, 3 to 5 percent of city blocks account for 50 to 75 percent of all shootings and killings” The social services can be costly, but they’re needed for the strategy to work. For one, they offer a way out to someone caught in a bad place in life  —   people often get trapped in violent situations due to desperate economic situations. And when cops offer these services, they also signal that they’re not just there to enforce the law, but also to try to help people out of dire circumstances. “That lends a certain legitimacy to the police,” Rosenfeld said. “They’re not there to just serve warrants or warn people about what’s going to happen to them if they commit another crime, but also conveys a certain degree of concern for those individuals and their lives. ” So these strategies can limit who’s directly impacted by policing  —   by targeting a few people in a few areas, instead of sweeping whole neighborhoods with aggressive stops. They can also signal to the community that the police get it: Most people in these communities are innocent, and police are going to focus only on those who aren’t. As Abt told me, “If you get very specific, you are better at fighting crime and reducing violence. But you also improve legitimacy by showing the community that you’re not occupying them like a military, but that you’re serving them by trying to help them address a small number of people in places that really are hurting the community. ” One big hurdle to these strategies is they can involve a big initial investment  —   and police departments, used to fighting crime in a certain way, may be resistant to new ideas, especially if they cost more money upfront. But if these strategies work to save and improve lives, there’s a moral imperative for all levels of government to take them more seriously. 8) We need better data to evaluate police and crime            If the federal government does get more involved in funding policing, it could also stand to make another change: massively improve the data we collect on crime and policing in America. As it stands, the federal government does a terrible job collecting data on crime and police actions. Nationwide crime reports tend to come out with a nearly   lag period. And virtually every expert agrees that this data very likely undercounts crime, since it misses crimes that aren’t reported to the police.  “We know virtually nothing about crime in America other than murder, kidnapping, and  arson,” Roman of the University of Chicago said. “Rape, robbery, assault, motor vehicle theft, gangs, drugs  —   we don’t report data back to the federal government that allows the federal government to tell law enforcement how to behave more efficiently or helps researchers understand how crime is created and evolves. ” “We know virtually nothing about crime in America other than murder, kidnapping, and arson” But more comprehensive, current data could be very useful for fighting crime, several experts argued. “You need that comparative information so you can determine whether that problem you’re experiencing in your own community is relatively distinctive or specific to local community conditions or it’s a common problem in many, many other communities,” Rosenfeld said. “If it’s the latter, you want to consult with those other communities to see how they’re addressing it. If it’s the former, then you know you have to devise strategies that respond to the specifics of the problems in your own community. ” It’s not just crime. Goff pointed out that there’s little to no data on what police do  —   stops, arrests, use of force, and so on. A 2015 study found that the federal agencies’ police killing data misses as many as half of all people killed by police in America. And the federal government doesn’t try to track more typical police actions, from stops to arrests. (The Justice Department is now moving on a couple of initiatives to change this, but they are still in very early stages, and it’s unclear if the Trump administration will continue these efforts.) As long as the US fails to collect this data, it’s going to be impossible to evaluate what works to address virtually any of the issues people have with police, from racial bias to crime fighting. It may cost more money to collect this data properly, but every expert I talked to brought it up as a major issue that needs to be addressed. If police get this right, they can boost faith in cops and their legitimacy in crime fighting            There’s an underlying point in all these strategies: More effective and transparent policing really can solve the two big problems  —   racial bias and high crime  —   pegged to police in America today. Whenever another police shooting of a black man hits the news, opponents of Black Lives Matter tend to fall back on a question: “But what about    crime?” The suggestion is that far more black people are murdered by black civilians, so that’s really what someone worried about black lives should worry about. What these critics miss is that distrust in the police  —   the key driver behind Black Lives Matter  —   is also a key driver of crime in minority neighborhoods. “When communities don’t trust the police and are afraid of the police, then they will not and cannot work with police and within the law around issues in their own community,” Kennedy of John Jay College said. “Then those issues within the community become issues the community needs to deal with on their own  —   and that leads to violence. ” A recent study was particularly illuminating to this end. The study, from sociologists Matthew Desmond of Harvard, Andrew Papachristos of Yale, and David Kirk of Oxford, looked at the effects of 911 calls in Milwaukee after incidents of police violence hit the news.  They found that after the 2004 police beating of Frank Jude, 17 percent (22, 200) fewer 911 calls were made in the following year compared with the number of calls that would have been made had the Jude beating never happened. More than half of the effect came from fewer calls in black neighborhoods. And the effect persisted for more than a year, even after the officers involved in the beating were punished. Researchers found similar impacts on local 911 calls after other   incidents of police violence. “When communities don’t trust the police and are afraid of the police, then they will not and cannot work with police and within the law around issues in their own community” But crime was still happening in these neighborhoods. Indeed, as 911 calls dropped, researchers also found a rise in homicides. They note that “the spring and summer that followed Jude’s story were the deadliest in the seven years observed in our study. ” That suggests that people were simply dealing with crime themselves. And although the researchers couldn’t definitively prove it, that might mean civilians took to their own  —   sometimes violent  —   means to protect themselves when they couldn’t trust police to stop crime and violence. “An important implication of this finding is that publicized cases of police violence not only threaten the legitimacy and reputation of law enforcement,” the researchers write, “they also  —   by driving down 911 calls  —   thwart the suppression of law breaking, obstruct the application of justice, and ultimately make cities as a whole, and the black community in particular, less safe. ” Better policing can’t stop all crime. There are many other issues, from jobs to housing, that also have an impact. But police, if they are trusted by the community, can have a sizable effect. To some degree, this should be common sense. Journalist Jill Leovy captured it well in her brilliant book Ghettoside: Noting that homicides are much less likely to be solved in black neighborhoods, she argues that some people in black communities have concluded that police don’t value black lives  —   and so they need to settle interpersonal conflicts on their own. Leovy writes, “Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens. ” That’s why transparency, accountability, and community cooperation, described as part of the “procedural justice” model of policing, are all so important: They signal that the justice system does care. And if the police do it right  —   by stopping overly aggressive practices and preventing crime and violence in black neighborhoods  —   they can signal that black lives really do matter to them.

"'Speaking Simulator' Feels Different When You Have a Stutter. When's the last time you thought about saying a word? Like, the actual, physical, tongue-on-teeth process of saying it? The plosives and fricatives of a complex word, the specific place your lips meet or don't to shape and push out a puff of air that carries a sound. Unless you're a performer, you might have gone your entire life without thinking about this at all. Most people learn to talk when they're infants. It's knowledge we wake up with when we emerge into the conscious world. Every able-mouthed person, with few exceptions, knows how to talk. You never think about it. You just open your mouth and speak. Speaking Simulator, by developer Affable Games, puts the player in the head of a robot that has to puzzle out, syllable by syllable, how to talk. The droid's programmers apparently skipped out on that portion of its design, and in order to keep the human-shaped machine from being outed as decidedly not human, you as the player have to guide it through conversation after conversation. It's played for comedy, with a tongue that's a looping, overlong snake of a thing and teeth that fall out of the robot's head if you press them too hard. Every interaction is deliberately clumsy and difficult to control, so that even when you succeed, you have smoke coming out of your ears. Speaking Simulator is a part of a tradition of ""simulator"" games that are poorly designed on purpose, set up not to actually simulate the act of doing something but to render the entire exercise absurd. Goat Simulator is the obvious genre foundation, which spurred a bevy of imitators—it's a game about controlling a goat, only you barely can, and you just fling your goat-self around the world causing chaos. These sims aren't meant to be played for long periods of time, or engaged with in utmost seriousness. You play them for a half an hour here or there, showing them to friends, giggling about them on stream. At best, you think deeply for a moment about how silly the act of X really is, whether X equals walking or talking to being a goat. At worst, you chuckle a few moments and move on. Simulator games aren't supposed to make you think, really. They're certainly not supposed to make you uncomfortable. I can't ever remember not having my stutter. As such, it's somewhat challenging to describe. But basically, sometimes, when I open my mouth and words are supposed to happen, they … don't. Something about it gets stuck as if my mouth is a clogged drain. It's hard sounds, usually, the consonants at the beginning of words, the t in “tower” or the c in “can.” It happens more frequently at the beginning of sentences, when my mouth and throat are just starting to get into the swing of a thought. Sometimes these blocks are small, little stumbles in my speech, whereas other times they become walls that I slam into. I've never been told, satisfactorily, why I have a stutter. As far as I'm aware, there isn't a clear scientific answer. Some strange miscommunication between brain and limb. When I was a kid, they flattered me by telling me that my mind was simply moving faster than my mouth could keep up. Whatever the reason, I started seeing a speech therapist before I was old enough to do preschool. It was worse then; a lisp alongside the stutter. I saw a speech therapist regularly up until I was about 15. Most days, now, you wouldn't know I have it. It comes out mostly when I'm stressed, exhausted, or anxious. Even so, I consider speaking a secondary function of my selfhood. Walking, looking around, touching, writing—these are primary functions. Talking is secondary. If anything goes wrong, it starts to slip. The frantic struggle to make this ridiculous robot's mouth move doesn't amuse me or pull some warm recognition out of me. It's infuriating. In the first stage of Speaking Simulator, I'm on a date with a coworker, struggling to push out comically written flirtations and prepping my drink order. But in my mind I'm back in elementary school. That's when it was the worst. Some days, I could barely talk at all. I'd constantly get drowned out by other people, interrupted and cut off. Speaking Simulator hits those same buttons for me. The frantic struggle to make this ridiculous robot's mouth move doesn't amuse me or pull some warm recognition out of me. It's infuriating. I spontaneously begin remembering the techniques I was taught to soothe my stutter: Elongate sounds to push through them, tuhhhhhhh-ake to get through a blockage in a word like “take,” luhhhhake for a word like “lake.” Remember to take deep breaths. Pause, relax, and breathe before trying again. Don't let other people interrupt you or finish your sentences. Don't pick a new word. The goal isn't just to be understood. It's to be able to say what you want to say, when you want to say it. Speaking Simulator wasn't designed to hit my trauma points so effectively. It likely wasn't designed to reflect real-life speech impediments at all. Instead, it feels more broadly aimed at social anxiety itself, the fear of being seen as an outsider in stressful situations, of being outed as a weirdo at work or on a date. And, of course, it's aimed at getting a few nervous laughs. But it's not a game about social anxiety, either, despite the presence of periphery mechanics like eye contact that are more broadly interested in social interaction as such: It's about speaking as a mechanical nightmare. And that can't help but raise some questions. Questions like: Why isn't there any evidence that real-life speech impediments were considered as even a touchstone for this title's development? Or, when my experiences are represented by a poorly made robot, should I feel insulted? I don't believe for a moment that Speaking Simulator intends to insult me. But it feels clumsily made. Take QWOP, a game that similarly defamiliarizes and makes silly the act of walking. I can't speak to how it feels to play QWOP with a motor disability, but it's a game built entirely around the joy of unexpected success. There's nothing you can do but get better; the game doesn't track your failures but your greatest distance traveled. Speaking Simulator, on the other hand, has a suspicion meter that gets higher with every failure. There's nothing you can do but barely get by. Barely getting by is how I've felt about talking for most of my life. Which, I suppose, makes Speaking Simulator the most accurate simulation of having a speech impediment I've ever played. But don't take that for a recommendation.",0.0

"Best Buy Bucks the Trend That’s Crushing Other Retailers. Holiday season may be full of cheer, but it’s also a time of intense pressure for retailers, especially in electronics. More than 20 percent of annual sales for things such as televisions, phones, cameras, and games occur between Thanksgiving and Christmas. One likely beneficiary is a company that most assumed would be long gone by now, consumed by the retail holocaust that has seen so many once-proud chains go the way of Chapter 11. Far from facing extinction, Best Buy is poised for another year of solid growth. Its relative success stands in sharp contrast to the fate of retail in general, and its formula should serve as a reminder that retailing may be changing, but not everything will be ecommerce. The tectonic shift from brick-and-mortar retail to online commerce has entered its middle phase. While ecommerce still accounts for little more than 10 percent of overall retail sales, those sales are growing roughly five times as fast as traditional stores; and if you factor out things like fuel and restaurants, ecommerce is more than 15 percent of total sales. So at some point in the coming years, ecommerce could become the majority of retail sales. But Best Buy’s resurgence suggests that humans will continue to value the physical experience of stores—provided that stores offer a vibrant experience combined with a conduit to services consumers need and value. In a world where just about anything can be bought online and shipped to your door, stores that offer more ephemeral things that can’t be packaged in a cardboard box and that meet needs will find a brighter future than most expected even a few years ago. In 2012, Forbes confidently declared “Best Buy is going out of business; it’s only a matter of time, perhaps a few more years.” Given the trends at the time, that was a reasonable conclusion. Its main competitor, Circuit City, had already closed its doors, and Best Buy was losing momentum fast; its stock had lost more than 40 percent of its value in a short time, and its market cap was below $10 billion. Its stores were looking increasingly sad, with a sales staff that was forced into untenable quotas and trained to sell rather than serve. And, of course, the drumbeat of Amazon was ever in their ears, drowning out Christmas carols even in the normally robust holiday season. Its holiday sales in both 2012 and 2013 actually declined year-over-year, which more than confirmed that the death knell was near. Except it wasn’t. Over the next five years, Best Buy defied expectations and avoided the fate of so many other retailers like Toys ""R"" Us, Barney’s, and Borders. Rather than being yet another high-profile victim of the ecommerce-fueled retail apocalypse, the Minnesota-headquartered Best Buy, under CEO Hubert Joly and, since June, Corie Barry, has focused on what it can offer that the internet cannot: engaging physical stores, knowledgeable staff, a “Geek Squad” that will install and synchronize your electronics in-home, and a relentless discipline about inventory management, costs, and closing underperforming stores. None of those things are earthshaking or radical. Yet when faced with declining sales and overall economic weakness in the years following the Great Recession of 2008–2009, Best Buy and other chains buckled under the pressure and lost sight of what they could do that pointing and clicking could not. As the recently opened American Dream mall in New Jersey provisionally shows, more people are hungry for experiences wrapped up in their shopping and will choose to shop at a physical store if they can have an experience that goes with it. The most extreme example is Changi Airport in Singapore, which has become a retail mecca and fantastical set of enclosed adventures, with waterfalls and trails, attracting not just transit passengers but tourists visiting the airport itself. If an airport can become a retail destination, anything can. But that destination must offer either a transporting physical and visual experience or a level of service that can’t be easily replicated online. Best Buy stores are hardly stunning, but they are, in a way that they weren’t a decade ago, welcoming: They're full of places to fiddle with gadgets and have staff members who are knowledgeable, passionate, and take pleasure at explaining and demonstrating. And then, in what may have been the most important of Joly’s innovations, Best Buy can dispatch its Geek Squad to help set up those systems in your home or office and recommend other products and services to make everything run seamlessly, or at least with fewer glitches. That model, of teams to help you install and manage a wired household, isn’t applicable to much of retail: You don’t need a Geek Squad for a bookstore or a grocery. But the idea that with a physical place should come human service can have wider application. Best Buy located the customer pain point, which for consumer tech is getting devices to sync and integrate and talk with one another without hours spent dealing with customer service. Yes, you can buy everything and anything sold at Best Buy elsewhere, often for the same or lower price. But the mix of selection you can play with and people who can help you is an analog reality without a digital incarnation. Best Buy is one of a handful of large retailers who seemingly have defied the trends toward ecommerce, along with chains such as Lululemon and Target. They share a commitment to service and experience that will only become more essential as ecommerce and same-day delivery become even easier. People may not always want the social aspect of shopping. But until everything works perfectly and effortlessly out of the package in the way that, say, a baseball “works” when you take one home, many people will want to test things in stores—and need help making them work at home; the need likely will increase with the proliferation and complexity of smart devices and appliances. The world may be barreling toward a digital, online future, but as long as we flesh-and-blood people inhabit it, businesses such as Best Buy that serve our human needs as much as our digital ones may be with us for a very long while.",0.0
"This photographer’s photos show the tender moments in her grandmother’s final days.         Old family photographs on Marisa Vesco’s bed. (Gaia  )  My grandmother’s life and mine overlapped for 27 years. I always called her “Nonna. ” Our age difference and profoundly contrasting values and way of thinking did not prevent us from developing a strong bond and a relationship punctuated by mischievous games and moments of tenderness and humor. We were amused by our differences. “You know, I was still young when you were born,” she told me a few weeks before she died. “It’s a little like we grew up together. ” At a lunch table a few months earlier in Milan, I learned from my mother, her daughter, that Nonna, 85, was suffering from incurable liver cancer. Years before, she had already survived two bouts of breast cancer. Nonna would tell me time and time again that the news of my birth had given her the strength to fight. When I learned that she was sick again, I had just landed in Italy, where I would be for only three days before flying back to New York.    Marisa Vesco eats breakfast in her bed. (Gaia  )     Marisa Vesco eats ice cream in her bed. (Gaia  )  Even more heartbreaking than the fear of saying goodbye to her was the fact that my grandmother did not know how sick she was. My mother and aunt believed she could not bear the thought of a third bout with cancer, this time affecting her liver. Nonna was told by family members that her liver was ill. No one ever mentioned the word “cancer. ” Because of this, one question haunted us until the day she died: Did we have the right to know the truth about her condition when she did not? Nonna spent most of her last months at home, surrounded by family. She reconciled with the idea of death and said she could slowly feel it coming. Doctors felt that surgery and chemotherapy would be pointless. In the midst of all this, I realized that my mother was losing her mother. After moving back to Italy for a few months, I witnessed the range of my mother’s emotions and the energy she devoted to the time they had left together. Nonna’s world shrank to a few walls and fewer streets. In this narrow existence, every detail and daily act took on deeper meaning. One of the things my mother treasured most was giving her mother a bath. She did not hesitate to touch her old body, and she did not want others to do it on her behalf.    Chiara Micheletti helps her mother Marisa Vesco take a shower. (Gaia  )  I joined my mother and grandmother in the bathroom to quietly observe them with my camera. As I experienced those precious moments, I imagined myself at an older age and thought about how time changes one’s perspective on being a woman. As my grandmother faced my lens, completely naked, her body bearing the signs of past and present illnesses, she did not show the slightest bit of shame  —   only trust and pride.    The pills taken by Marisa Vesco to alleviate the symptoms of liver cancer. (Gaia  )     Marisa Vesco smiles as she sinks her face into the chest of her granddaughter, photographer Gaia Squarci. (Gaia  )     Marisa Vesco’s perfume bottles, almost all of which were empty, sit on the edge of the bath at her home. (Gaia  )     Chiara Micheletti embraces her mother Marisa Vesco in her room at a hospice where she stayed for a month and a half before her death. (Gaia  )  If you spoke with people in Nonna’s town, they would say she never left the house without being enveloped in a cloud of perfume, her white hair perfectly coiffed and her face tinged with makeup. I was surprised by the way she confronted being ill without losing her femininity. She was able to poke fun at herself. More than once she asked me, “Am I going to end up on Vogue or Marie Claire?” On Oct. 11, 2015, the day Nonna died in Biella, Italy, I was across the world in Brooklyn, N. Y. I had spent five months with her, celebrating her life instead of mourning her death. I remember taking a walk through the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn and staring for a while at kids competing in a race. I was unable to come to terms with the fact she was no longer a part of the world around me. I struggled with the concept of death and the abstract emotion we call grief. I found peace only when I returned to Italy to spread Nonna’s ashes. My family and I walked to Nonna’s favorite place in the mountains not far from Cossato in northwestern Italy, the town in which she had grown up. Her ashes felt heavy in my hands. I threw them far up into the air, and they fell all over the grass, and all over me. My mother, brother and aunt did the same, again and again. In the end, we were covered in Nonna’s ashes and so was the field around us. Months later, my mother sent me a photograph of that field. It was completely covered in flowers.    Marisa Vesco’s ashes are spread by her nephew Luca Squarci at her favorite location where she grew up near Cossato, Italy. (Gaia  ) ",-0.5
"Clinton blames Comey’s email probe for her defeat. Hillary Clinton blamed FBI director James Comey for her stunning defeat in Tuesday’s presidential election in a conference call with her top campaign funders on Saturday, according to two participants on the call. Clinton was projected by nearly every national public opinion poll as the heavy favorite going into Tuesday’s race. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won the election, shocking many throughout the nation and prompting widespread protests. Clinton has kept a low profile since her defeat after delivering her concession speech on Wednesday morning. On the phone call with supporters on Saturday, Clinton said her campaign and the national party had raised $900 million from more than 3 million individual donors, according to the two participants who spoke to Reuters. Clinton said Comey was at fault for her loss after he decided to send a letter to Congress only days before the election announcing that he was reinstating an investigation into whether she mishandled classified information when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2012. Comey announced a week later that he had reviewed emails and continued to believe she should not be prosecuted, but the political damage was already done. Clinton told donors that Trump was able to seize on both of Comey’s announcements and use them to attack her, according to two participants on the call. While the second letter cleared her of wrongdoing, Clinton said that reinforced to Trump’s supporters that the system was rigged in her favor and motivated them to mobilize on Election Day.",1.0

"Jeff Sessions doesn’t think a judge in Hawaii — a.k.a. ‘an island in the Pacific’ — should overrule Trump.      First, candidate Donald Trump said a judge of Mexican descent couldn’t give him a fair hearing. Now, President Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is suggesting that a judge from Hawaii  —   which he dismissively labels “an island in the Pacific”  —   should not be able to strike down Trump’s travel ban. Here’s what Sessions told radio host Mark Levin on Wednesday, in audio uncovered by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power.  There are a few problems with this. The first is that Hawaii is a state and has been since 1959. Dismissing it as “an island in the Pacific” is the kind of thing that will earn you the pleasure of apologizing to an entire state. We’ll start the countdown clock. The second is that the judge isn’t a Hawaiian judge, per se. Derrick Watson is actually a federal judge who happens to serve on a district court in Hawaii. And in case you were wondering, he has some of that   mainland experience and perspective, having worked as a lawyer in San Francisco. And the third is that Hawaii does have major ports of entry, with international travelers arriving regularly. (We hear the beaches are nice or something?) Hence, it is affected by Trump’s travel ban.       The Aloha State says President Trump’s revised executive order still violates the Constitution. (Gillian   Washington Post)   This is hardly the first time the Trump administration has sought to undercut or question the powers of judges who run afoul of Trump. There was Gonzalo Curiel, of course, and then there was Trump’s lengthy campaign to question whether the courts even had the authority of overrule his travel ban. Even   Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch called Trump’s attacks on judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” Trump seemed to back away from those attacks for a while. But now Sessions has picked them up again. Your move, entire state of Hawaii. Update: Hawaii’s two Democratic senators have responded:   Mr. Attorney General: You voted for that judge. And that island is called Oahu. It’s my home.

"How Monday’s train attack by a 17-year-old Afghan could change the German refugee debate.        Germany has so far been spared a   Islamist terrorist attack similar to the ones that have targeted neighboring France and Belgium. But Monday’s attack on a German train by a    Afghan refugee has brought new fears about radicalized individuals, as more information emerged that the attacker had pledged loyalty to the Islamic State militant group in a video.   [‘I will slaughter you in your houses and tear you apart’: ISIS releases video of German train attacker]   According to the SITE Intelligence Group, the teenager went on to threaten more Islamic State attacks ”in every village, city and airport.” The ”welcoming culture” that defined Germany last year during the migrant influx has largely disappeared, and Monday’s attack could mark another significant development in the country’s public debate about refugees. “  and Islamophobic opinions in the German population will grow, and there is a high risk of attacks on refugee centers in the coming weeks and months,” said Daniel Koehler, director of Germany’s Institute on Radicalization and   Studies and a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “The current   populist, extremist and   movement will experience another surge in support. They will try to capitalize on this,” he said. Skepticism of refugees had risen particularly after the sexual assaults of about 1, 200 women on New Year’s Eve, which put the country into a shock mode for weeks and sparked a backlash against refugees after authorities said many of the suspects were asylum seekers from North Africa. So far, concerns focused primarily on young male refugees who had come to the country alone. Monday’s ax attack has raised new questions about whether German authorities are too overwhelmed to provide adequate support for those refugees, particularly for unaccompanied minors.   [German politician stirs debate after criticizing police for shooting   attacker]   Authorities in Bavaria, the southern German region where the train attack occurred, said Tuesday that they had put a particular focus on Salafist recruitment of unaccompanied minors for months. It was unclear whether those efforts had been a product of specific information indicating that recruiters were targeting minors, or whether they were part of more general precautions. ”Maybe we need to take care of unaccompanied minors even more so that they can overcome their trauma,” said Friedhelm Hofmann, the bishop of Wuerzburg, which is located near where the attacker lived. Hofmann was quoted by local newspapers as saying that it would be wrong to view all asylum seekers with suspicion in the wake of the attack. But Koehler believes that the likelihood of similar attacks in the future is high, partially because Germany’s counterterrorism efforts lack a coherent strategy that would have to necessarily include more psychological counseling. “The authorities are well aware of the potential risks of overcrowded refugee centers, constant   attacks, lack of perspectives, long bureaucratic procedures and Salafists trying to recruit in these facilities,” he said. But calls for better training for volunteers and social workers on how to spot the initial signs of radicalization have been turned down. For months, authorities struggled to even provide food and shelter to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who arrived last year. Germany took in more than 1 million refugees last year alone. Although the number of unaccompanied minors who fled to the country and are officially registered is much lower and stands at about 52, 000, there are increasing concerns that younger refugees in particular are at high risk of becoming radicalized. Monday’s attack appears to be the first committed by an underage asylum seeker.    Police officers walk to the crime scene near the river Main, background, where a    from Afghanistan was shot the night before, in Wuerzburg, Germany. (Michael  )  When a    girl who allegedly expressed sympathies for the Islamic State stabbed a police officer in Hanover in March, authorities considered it an isolated incident. Since then, however, there are growing signs that the problem of youth radicalization is more widespread than previously assumed. In April, several people were injured when a bomb exploded in a Sikh temple in the western town of Essen, and authorities say two    and one    were behind the attack. The three suspects are believed to have had ties to the Salafist community in Essen. Although most of the underage suspects were not refugees, authorities are concerned that young refugees might be a prime target for recruiters and online propaganda. Those concerns emerged much earlier. In September 2015, Burkhard Freier, the head of   Westphalia’s state intelligence agency, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper: Refugees ”go through exceptional circumstances and seek shelter and inclusion into a society. This is what Salafists exploit to attract young refugees for their cause.” Koehler said the recent incidents constitute a new but hardly surprising phenomenon in Germany. An Islamic State recruitment handbook, for instance, advises sympathizers to target young adults or teenagers. “In a way ISIL has tried to turn their youngest recruit generation, which was originally being prepared to join the caliphate, into human weapons,” he said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State and referring to the group’s decreasing footprint in Syria and Iraq. Although many refugees flee from Syria and Iraq to escape violence and radicalism, authorities in Germany and elsewhere fear that underage asylum seekers, in particular, may nevertheless be more vulnerable to radicalization in Europe. “Fleeing from a war zone and leaving your family behind is a highly traumatic experience, which could act as a driving factor for radicalization,” Koehler said.

They’ve all but signed an official concession to playoff elimination  —   the tragic number is 10, by the way. Additionally, they have lost to every team not named the Magic since Feb. 27, have had the team president   and have surrendered at least 104 points in six straight games. And now the future face of the franchise, Kristaps Porzingis,  . His state after the   on Sunday was representative of the current state of the team, which is a veritable mess. “It’s pretty high,” Porzingis said of the frustration level sweeping the Knicks, who face the Pacers at home Tuesday, blizzard permitting, hoping to end a   losing streak that has made the misery meter show 12 losses in 16 games. Where exactly is the confusion? “From top to bottom. A lot of stuff that’s not clear. So it’s hard to play like that,” Porzingis said. Hey, they didn’t get to   by accident. But they only need to win every remaining game to avoid a fourth straight losing season. “The situation is tough. We’re not doing the right thing. We’re just not working together right now,” Porzingis said. “Whatever   …     games we have left, we have to give everything we have so we can finish the season not regretting anything. As players, we got to give everything we have. ” Though so very much has been made of the triangle offense and the Knicks’ attempts to incorporate it down the stretch while   next season, the Knicks defense has not quite conjured up images of Bad Boys. Marshmallows and babies’ butts, yes, Steel Curtains and Doomsday, no. Against the Nets, the Knicks surrendered 39 points and 55. 6 percent shooting in the first quarter and fought uphill all game. The Nets crushed the Knicks with 19   including a   14 in the first half. “I don’t know what the thinking was coming out at the start of the game, but we gave them   shots and they kept making 3 after 3 after 3,” coach Jeff Hornacek said. “You can’t be off to those starts in the first half and think you’re going to win a game. ”         So, the defense stunk. The offense? “It’s pretty random. We have some plays that Jeff draws up, but most of the time it’s after free throws or so, [and] we’re running triangle,” Porzingis said. “But we never really got it all together and were able to execute the way we should have. It’s been a lot of confusion. “First of all, we don’t know the triangle that well. ” Guess Phil Jackson will be on the court showing a little more stuff,   though Jackson’s little pointer session last week was overblown, Hornacek said. “He just wanted to show the guards a couple things. There were five things, three of them we do, one of them was probably a little new and one of them we do out of timeouts. Just a reiteration of those things that are out there with the guards working together,” Hornacek said. Still, the Knicks might want to   the drawing board. Or Freud’s couch. Rose, who seemingly places the triangle somewhere between food poisoning and stainless steel splinters on his   list,   but recently grudgingly noted, “Do I have a choice?” Carmelo Anthony took nine shots Saturday. Then he took nine in the first quarter Sunday. Might want to balance that consistency thing. Through all the frustration and confusion, Porzingis tries to be a       Latvian guy. He says this season has been a challenge, but it will make him better. “That’s how I always take it  —   as a challenge. It’s a tough year, but I’m just trying to get individually better and working on my game every day so one day we can make steps forward and hopefully win big some time,” Porzingis said. “I think this year is a really good experience for me. ”",1.0
"The real reason you get depressed in winter. When Manhattan writer Anna Breslaw is invited out for drinks, she usually says no. It’s not because she has sworn off alcohol or has other commitments. Breslaw suffers from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) also known as winter depression or seasonal depression. Its symptoms include excessive sleeping, low energy and increased anxiety  —   all caused by lack of natural light. “Everything is a lot harder for me, particularly in January and February,” says the   of the novel “ . ” SAD was formally recognized as a condition by the National Institute of Mental Health in 1984 following studies by   clinical professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine and author of the book “ . ” He claims   of the population residing on the US’s   Northeast Coast displays at least some of SAD’s symptoms, which can also include increased appetite, social isolation and cravings for sweets and starch.   of the population residing on the US’s   Northeast Coast displays at least some of SAD’s symptoms. But SAD is not without its skeptics. For years, critics have said it is no different from regular depression. In January 2016, a study headed by Steven LoBello of Auburn University in Alabama   at different times of the year and in various time zones. The findings suggested that incidences of depression are stable across different latitudes, seasons and sunlight exposures, causing some to cast doubt on SAD as a legitimate psychiatric disorder. “There’s this idea of a folk construct of seasonal depression,” LoBello tells the Post. “In wintertime, depending how severe your winter is   …     it might impact your mood, but not to the extent of major depression. ” But Breslaw has no doubts about the effect of the season on her mood. Her psychiatrist increases her usual dose of the antidepressant Wellbutrin by 50 percent in winter in an effort to treat the symptoms, and every morning Breslaw uses a light therapy box  —   bulbs in a box with a diffusing screen that expose the user to intense levels of light under controlled conditions. Rosenthal, too, stands firm and is doubtful of LoBello’s findings. “SAD is a pattern that can only be determined by examining a person’s history over time, not at a single point,” he says. “[There’s] vast literature from many countries showing SAD to be a major problem. ” Feeling down? Here are Rosenthal’s tips to getting better.  Use a   light therapy box (from $50 to $350, depending on the model) for 10 minutes every day.  Take a multivitamin containing vitamin D, which is naturally derived from sunlight. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphate from our diets, and is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles.  Invest in a dawn simulator or sunrise lamp (from $20) that mimics early morning light if it’s dark outside.  Do    exercise; it releases endorphins to fight low mood and carbohydrate cravings.  See a health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist (who can prescribe medicine).",1.0
"New York City to close Rikers Island. Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday   with “at least a few new facilities” to lock up jailbirds elsewhere in the city. “New York City will close the Rikers Island jail facility,” de Blasio said during a City Hall news conference. “It will take many years, it will take many tough decisions along the way. But it will happen. ” But de Blasio stopped short of adopting the recommendations in a draft report from a   panel headed by former New York state Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman. That plan calls for building a new jail in each of the city’s five boroughs at a total estimated cost of $10. 6 billion. “I’m working from a neutral position of saying I only know this: We will need a few more facilities,” de Blasio said. “There’s no assumption on the number or location or how many. ” De Blasio last year publicly rejected calls to close Rikers, calling it a “noble concept” but saying “it would cost many billions of dollars  —   and I have to look out for what’s feasible, and I have to look out for the taxpayer. ” A draft version of Lippman’s report obtained by The Post recommends reducing the Rikers population  —   now around 10, 000  —   by about half and replacing the   correction complex with five new jails spread across the city. Those moves would cut the need for uniformed correction officers from 10, 500 now to just 3, 700, according to the plan. The number of civilian jail workers should remain stable at 2, 000, “to promote positive,   programming for those incarcerated,” the draft report says. Lippman’s proposal calls for putting new jails on   land that’s “as close as possible to courthouses and public transportation. ” The   report doesn’t identify any potential locations, but says “the siting and planning process for any jail facility should be as transparent as possible. ” “We know from hard experience that Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) opposition can pose a significant challenge for projects like these,” according to the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform. De Blasio was furious when The Post on Thursday evening exclusively revealed details from Lippman’s plan. The mayor “wanted credit, and he wanted to   Lippman,” said a source with deep ties to City Hall. Lippman had been planning to release his commission’s report Sunday, sources said. Staten Island Borough President James Oddo fired the first shot against the plan Thursday evening   to The Post’s report. “This. Will. Be. A. War,” Oddo wrote. “I have no faith the ‘Commission’ gives a damn about my community but @NYCMayor can stand up for SI and say this is not happening. ”",1.0
"The Republican Party has lost to Donald Trump.  All year, Republicans have been trying to convince themselves that Donald Trump would pivot to the general election once he got the nomination  —   cleaning up his act, professionalizing his campaign, and making appeals beyond his base.    In his first two weeks after the Republican National Convention, he’s basically done the exact opposite. In late July, the day after grabbing the nomination, Trump went on a rant about Ted Cruz, reviving his bizarre accusation that Cruz’s father might’ve been involved in killing JFK. From there, things only got worse. Trump suggested offhand in a New York Times interview that the US shouldn’t honor its NATO commitments. This past weekend, he attacked Khizr Khan, the bereaved father of Army Captain Humayun Khan. He then pointedly refused to endorse Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who has already endorsed him, enraging Republicans. It’s worth noting that Trump has often had controversies and bad weeks like this before, and they never seem to faze him much. But this time around, Republican leaders and politicians seem genuinely rattled.    NBC’s Katy Tur reported that RNC Chair Reince Priebus was ”apoplectic” over Trump’s   of Ryan and has reached out to the campaign to share his ”extreme displeasure.” NBC is reporting that Priebus, Rudy Giuliani, and Newt Gingrich are ”plotting an intervention” with Trump  —   which Trump’s campaign chair Paul Manafort denies. Richard Hanna became the first Republican Congress member to cross party lines and endorse Clinton for president.    Before the convention, Trump was making an effort to persuade the GOP establishment that he was an acceptable candidate. He picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate. Manafort was brought in to professionalize the campaign. Trump’s campaign speeches became more scripted. But for Trump, a   dealmaking master, those negotiations with the GOP ended once he was declared the official Republican nominee. If the past two weeks are any indication, Trump is now free to do whatever he wants, and there’s not much the rest of the party can do.    Since the Republican convention, Trump has gone completely off the rails To recap: In the past two weeks, Trump has engaged in an extremely   feud with a Muslim Gold Star family, calling Khizr Khan a liar and asserting he was ”bothered” by Trump’s plan to keep ”radical Islam” out of the United States. His campaign staff has claimed Obama’s Iraq War policies were at fault for the Khans’ son’s death in 2004. Trump has also said he would not necessarily defend the United State’s NATO allies if attacked by foreign powers and threatened to pull out of the World Trade Organization. On Wednesday, Joe Scarborough suggested that Trump had asked one of his foreign policy advisers ”three times” why the United States couldn’t use its nuclear weapons. Trump has also asserted that Hillary Clinton’s campaign would rig the November election against him. He’s warned Americans to pull out of the stock market. He’s said he would not endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan’s congressional run, and instead praised Ryan’s challenger. He’s refused to endorse Sen. John McCain, saying that McCain, a veteran, ”has not done a good job for the vets.” He’s also lambasted New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, claiming she has given him ”zero support.”       Earlier hints that Trump’s campaign would become more professional are long gone To close watchers of the election, this recent Trump rampage is at least a little bit surprising. After all, in the weeks leading up to the GOP convention, it seemed like Trump’s campaign was going to rein him in. For a while, Trump was giving scripted speeches  —   particularly after he fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (who was known for letting Trump be Trump) and gave the reins to Manafort. It looked like Trump would at least try to control himself for the general election. But that didn’t last. In the past two weeks, it’s clear something has changed. The media is rife with speculation: CNBC’s John Harwood reported that Manafort is ”mailing it in,” according to a close friend. Another anonymous Republican source told CNN that Trump’s campaign staff, including Manafort, ”feel like they are wasting their time.” Trump’s campaign, for its part, is furiously denying these reports. ”The idea that Paul Manafort is mailing it in is completely erroneous,” Trump spokesperson Jason Miller said in a statement to CNN. ”Our campaign just finished up our strongest month of fundraising to date, we’re adding talented and experienced staffers on a daily basis and Mr. Trump’s turning out bigger, more enthusiastic crowds than Hillary Clinton ever could.” Manafort, for his part, told Fox News: ”Well, first of all the candidate is in control of his campaign. That’s No. 1. And I’m in control of doing the things that he wants me to do in the campaign. The turmoil  —   and this is another Clinton narrative that’s being put out there and that the media is picking up on.” However, patterns throughout the election suggest a tale of two Trumps: one being the    bombast, unapologetic and controversial, who appeals to his voters. The second, a scripted, more ”presidential” and curated Trump, meant ingratiate establishment conservatives.    When left to his own devices, Trump acts the way he is now. And with no Republican Party nomination left to win, there is no need to back down. Trump is never going to change, and now the GOP is stuck with him In the weeks leading up to the convention, many Republicans surmised that Trump would change for the general election and become more moderate. Some conservative pundits even thought the party could mold him to their liking. But as Vox’s Ezra Klein explained in April, Trump has too long a history of being Trump to ever make that shift:  Donald Trump has been powering a global brand by doing and saying outrageous things for decades now. He has built up an immunity to outrage and backlash. This personal fortitude is why Trump was able to take his wealth and turn it into personal, persistent celebrity. This deep  —   and continually rewarded  —   belief that flamboyance pays off is why Trump says what other presidential candidates won’t and does what other presidential candidates can’t. It’s why he can retweet white supremacists and play insult comic on the stump and encourage violence at his rallies and shrug off the brickbats of the Republican, Democratic, media, and cultural establishments. Most human beings could not stand the assault on their reputation, the abandonment by friends and business partners, the opprobrium of the media. But Trump can, because Trump has been this person, existing amidst constant controversy and ignoring the side eyes of the elites who think him gauche, for decades now.  Trump’s links to the GOP establishment, including Pence, are still trying to insist that Trump is with the Republican Party. But it has become increasingly clear that Trump has no interest in placating the GOP. ”It’s almost, in some ways, like I’m running against two parties,” Trump told conservative talk radio host Mike Gallagher in June. He’s still acting that way.    There was a brief period before the convention where Trump was essentially negotiating with the GOP establishment  —   trying to convince them to get behind him. (That was reportedly one reason he picked Pence.) But Trump has now won, and he can say and do whatever he wants.  This election is about normal vs. abnormal    ",-1.0
"Why Hillary Clinton is hitting Bernie Sanders from the left on bank regulation.  Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign did something a little unexpected early this week in advance of an expected Bernie Sanders speech on Wall Street reform  —   it tried to hit Sanders from the left by having campaign chief financial officer Gary Gensler accuse him of taking ”a   approach to some of the riskiest institutions and activities in our economy, which were among the biggest culprits during the 2008 crisis.” Sanders fired back through a spokesperson, Michael Briggs, who sniffed that the Vermont senator ”won’t be taking advice on how to regulate Wall Street from a former Goldman Sachs partner.”    But while it’s certainly true that Gensler used to work at Goldman Sachs, he’s better known in policy circles for his more recent job chairing the Commodity Futures Regulatory Commission in the Obama administration, a vantage point from which he became a hero to many financial reformers by clashing with Tim Geithner and Larry Summers over a desire for stricter rules for Wall Street. In a bit of a reversal of the usual political pattern, though, what began largely as an exercise in cynical gamesmanship and   has evolved into a wonky policy dispute. It is one that touches on important aspects of financial regulation but that also more broadly speaks to a   divide in American thinking about how to deal with the problems of corporate power in sensitive segments of the economy. Is the most important thing to break up existing large companies and prevent the emergence of new large ones? Or is the most important thing to regulate and supervise companies, in which case having a market dominated by a finite number of small players might even be helpful? The debate reflects the particular political circumstances of 2015 and the specific dynamics of the financial sector, but also essentially restages an argument between Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.    This started with an argument about ”shadow banks” The original policy argument between Clinton and Sanders started with what have come to be known as ”shadow banks.” The issue here is that while the term ”bank” is sometimes used loosely to refer to any financial institution, in regulatory terms a bank is a specific kind of business that takes deposits from customers and then takes the money to go make loans.    Because a bank deposit is very flexible (you can walk to the ATM and get your money anytime you want) banks can get away with paying a lower interest rate on deposits than they charge for loans. That’s a profit opportunity, but it also makes banks prone to runs. To prevent runs, banks receive both government support (depositors generally get bailed out even if the bank goes bust) and government regulation (to prevent excessive  ). The term ”shadow bank” was coined by Paul McCulley of the bond firm PIMCO, and the basic idea is that you don’t need to be an official bank to be essentially in the business of borrowing   money in order to finance   lending. This also means you don’t need to be an official bank in order to be subject to bank runs.    Much of the financial crisis originated via this kind of   banking in which mortgage originators, insurance companies, investment banks, hedge funds, and even foreign sovereign wealth funds teamed up in various combinations to lend money to US homebuyers outside the traditional banking system. The way the   spat started was that months ago Sanders came out in favor of two very tough rules on traditional banks. First, he favors a return to an old part of a   banking law called   which was repealed in the 1990s and said that a bank can’t be part of a company that offers   financial services like insurance or investment banking. (If you’re confused by the fact that investment banks are not banks, that is because the terminology is genuinely confusing  —   you’re not missing anything.) Second, he favors a hard limit on the overall size to which a bank can grow. Hillary Clinton, fitting her more moderate persona, declined to endorse either of those proposals. But she is also more of a policy wonk than Sanders, and her campaign has a bigger policy apparatus, so her financial regulation plan is considerably more comprehensive than Sanders’s and addresses issues  —   like shadow banking  —   that are outside the scope of Sanders’s proposals. That became Clinton’s opportunity to argue that her plan is actually tougher than his  —   that he would, in effect, let shadow banks off the hook.    Clinton poses that bank breakups aren’t sufficient Zachary Carter at the Huffington Post argues that Clinton’s jabs at Sanders amount to little more than ”semantic gamesmanship” and mischaracterize the situation. The Clinton camp, for example, notes the huge problems that arose at Lehman Brothers and AIG that were primarily in the investment banking and insurance industries respectively. Carter retorts that ”both AIG and Lehman operated traditional banking units that engaged in boring bank activities like accepting deposits and extending loans,” so Sanders’s   idea would, in fact, have impacted both companies. This is true, but it is also, in most ways, beside the point. The trouble with AIG and Lehman wasn’t that shadow activities pushed them to bankruptcy and imperiled their (small) traditional banking units. The problem was that their shadow activities pushed them to bankruptcy and imperiled the entire banking system.    to dwell on the point: BIG wasn’t what made Bear or Lehman dangerous. it was the ability to spill damage onto others.  —   Austan Goolsbee (@Austan_Goolsbee) January 5, 2016       Sanders’s regulatory proposals would have touched these institutions, but they wouldn’t have necessarily solved the problem or eliminated the need for shadow banks to be regulated as such. All of this is to say that the Clinton camp’s main argument against Sanders is that breaking up big banks is insufficient to the challenge of adequately regulating the financial system.    Sanders argues that bank breakups are necessary The counterargument from Sanders’s camp really rests on another point entirely. He is focused, as he often is, less on specific points of policy implementation than on big questions of political economy. He says that large financial institutions ”have acquired too much economic and political power, endangering our economy and our political process.” In keeping with this focus on power rather than bank risk, Sanders also touts his   of a bill that would ban the current practice at many banks of paying executives a special exit bonus if they leave to take a job with the government. Sanders sees those bonuses as implicitly corrupt and as part of a problematic revolving door whereby wealthy financial interests exercise undue influence over the political process. But this particular bill aside, it’s obviously difficult to piecemeal ban every possible way through which large banks can influence the political process. Better to smash them all at once, so that it’s simply not possible for any one institution to wield the kind of influence a Goldman Sachs or a JP Morgan currently can. This in part reflects longstanding disagreements over the bank bailouts of 2008. One view  —   certainly Clinton’s view and the Obama administration’s view  —   is that distasteful as these bailouts were, they would also be necessary and correct actions to take given the circumstances. Their hope is that an improved regulatory framework will make future crises less likely and future bailouts unnecessary. Sanders, by contrast, voted against bailouts on several occasions  —   a clear indication that he never thought they were necessary. To Clinton, the bailouts were made necessary by inadequate bank regulation, so she is proposing to improve bank regulation.    To Sanders, unnecessary bailouts were made possible by excessive bank political power, so he proposing to cut banks down to size. A historic debate             Sanders’s critique of Clinton in many ways recapitulates an old argument between Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt when both men were competing for a pool of   voters in the odd   campaign of 1912. (Conservative voters were expected to back William Howard Taft, and Taft was expected to lose badly, making the real question which progressive alternative to Taft would prevail.) Roosevelt was running on a platform he called New Nationalism, which argued, among other things, that the new   world of big business required the construction of a large federal regulatory apparatus to oversee the activities of big business. Given the stakes involved in the actions of major companies, it wasn’t good enough to just let the invisible hand fall where it might  —   regulators were needed to mind the store. Wilson offered a different critique of big business under the heading New Freedom. As Robert Saunders recounts in his book In Search of Woodrow Wilson, he ”sought to convince Roosevelt’s potential progressive supporters that Roosevelt’s posture on bigness in industry constituted an acceptance of monopoly and as such posed a threat to individual freedom and democracy in the United States.” Roosevelt called on the federal government to create stronger commissions to regulate big business, while ”Wilson questioned the wisdom of the experts who would staff the commissions and opposed the granting of broad, discretionary power to the commissioners since it would lead to a ’legitimized continuation’ of the alliance between government and monopoly.” Wilson wasn’t against commissions per se (and, indeed, as president he ended up creating several) but he argued that breaking up big   trusts and preventing the emergence of new ones had to be job number one.    In practice, the choice has rarely been as stark as Wilson’s campaign trail portrayal of it, and   regulatory agencies tend to do either some of both or neither, depending on their political orientation. But the general difference in philosophical approach is real and important. Clinton sees regulating Wall Street as important and necessary but also (fittingly for a former senator from New York) sees the fact that New York City is a global financial center as a source of US economic strength. She wants the United States to be home to globally competitive financial services companies just as it is home to globally competitive airplane manufacturing, technology, pharmaceutical, and entertainment companies. Sanders, by contrast, doesn’t really see what Wall Street does as in any way valuable or useful enough to justify big banks, and takes a ”better safe than sorry” approach to the idea of smashing up its biggest players.

"3 Rules for Designing Primo Virtual Reality. It’s Christmas 2016—prime gift-giving season. As many in the retail industry predicted, millions of people are unwrapping a Vive, Rift, PlayStation VR, or some other virtual reality device. I imagine many people, when faced with this unusual contraption, responded as my grandfather did when I gave him his first experience of virtual reality in 2014: “What am I supposed to do with this?” Then they did what we all do nowadays when we have a question—they asked Google. According to Google Trends, the use of the search term “VR Content” tripled between December 23 and December 26, 2016. Not coincidentally, so did queries for “VR Porn.” It seems people received their VR goggles, tried out a few stock demos, and then sought out, well, porn. In the late ’90s, before I founded Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, my initial research wasn’t geared toward VR as a consumer product. I worked in a psychology department at UCSB, and we viewed VR as a tool to understand basic brain science, not a gadget that sits next to the TV set. In fact, in my lab at UCSB we likened the VR system to a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine—a ridiculously expensive, bulky technology that needed constant maintenance and could only be administered by trained experts. Excerpted from Experience On Demand: What Virtual Reality Is, How It Works, and What It Can Do by Jeremy Bailenson. © 2018 by Jeremy Bailenson. Used with permission of the publisher, W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. All rights reserved. When I arrived at Stanford, I switched from a psychology department to a communication department studying media use. As my thinking evolved I began to imagine a world in which avatars and virtual reality were everywhere. I imagined a future as William Gibson or Neal Stephenson described it—with VR everywhere. And that raised a host of fascinating, sometimes troubling questions. Could politicians use avatars to rig elections? Could VR make advertisements more persuasive? Could changes in the weight of your avatar change the way you eat in the real world? But even as I explored these knotty issues, I was able to sleep at night just fine. After all, the technology was still confined to those with six-figure budgets and the engineers necessary to keep the systems running. But in 2010 my thinking began to change. Maybe it was that I was starting a family (my first child was born in 2011) or that I was witnessing the first wave of consumer VR technology flourish when Microsoft created the Kinect. Perhaps I was influenced by new mentors, people like Jaron Lanier—whose vision of VR was synonymous with a hippie-inspired notion of self-transformation—and Philip Rosedale, whose unbridled enthusiasm for a prosocial world of networked avatars was infectious. Or maybe I had just finally drunk the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid. Whatever it was, it now seemed to me that VR might just transform the world for the better—if only we could creatively harness its potential. What, then, are the types of virtual realities we could create, and how should we go about doing it? People fly to my lab from all over the world to hear answers to those questions. One of the questions I get asked most often by companies trying to get into VR is, “What should we do?” My answer, of course, depends on the context. I have had hundreds of these conversations since 2014, when VR began to go mainstream. Here are three loose guidelines that have emerged and evolved from those conversations: 1. Ask yourself, does this need to be in VR? I’ve come up with a few rules of thumb for how I think about appropriate VR use cases. First, VR is perfect for things you couldn’t do in the real world, but not for things you wouldn’t do in the real world. Flying to the moon like Superman is OK. Participating in virtual mass murder—especially if it is designed to be realistic—is not. This is a big deal. Everything we know about training in VR points to the realization that the medium is incredibly influential on future attitudes and behavior. Second, don’t waste the medium on the mundane. VR experiences should be engaged in mindfully. Since we are worried about distraction and addiction, we should save VR for truly special applications. The easiest way to tell whether VR is the right choice for a given experience is to ask: Is it impossible in the real world? If the answer is yes, then VR is a very safe bet. Time travel is not an option outside of Hollywood, so if you want to go back and meet your great-great-great-grandfather or feel what it is like to walk around as a cow or grow a third arm to be more productive in your daily tasks, then you should go with VR. Using VR to safely experience dangerous behaviors is another good use. A primitive version of VR technology was developed to simulate flight in the late 1920s. Now it’s time to extend this model of military training to firefighters, nurses, and police officers. Crowd control is a routine challenge for law enforcement, but it is impossible to build a real-world simulation to train officers to handle unruly mobs. Imagine how much more prepared officers would feel if they had dozens of virtual practice sessions under their belts. I get phone calls and emails from law enforcement officers fairly regularly. They see this technology as transformative. When I was growing up, you would hear stories about kids caught smoking cigarettes being made to smoke an entire pack to teach them a lesson—tough love, baby boomer style. This might be an effective way to handle a teachable moment, but it will certainly do damage to a kid’s lungs. In VR you can have the best of both worlds. No, you can’t simulate the pain of inhaling large amounts of toxic smoke, but you can show the longterm effects of smoking on an avatar or take a child on a guided tour of damaged lungs. Or: Illustrate the costs of damaging the environment without chopping down a single tree. Then go on a virtual tour of the devastation. It feels real, and the brain treats it like an experience, but no environmental damage occurs. VR can also be the right choice when access or cost—in time or money—is an issue. Traveling to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro doesn’t have to be physically or financially impossible or dangerous. Not only can VR afford stunning mountaintop views at a fraction of the expense and exertion, it will also save precious time. I once spent 40 hours—yes, a full work week—traveling back and forth to South Africa to give a 45-minute talk. If I could have used an avatar to give that talk, it would have been like having a 53-week-long year. And speaking of savings, consider VR’s potential to cut the costs of medical training for surgeons. Cadavers are expensive, and each organ can only get cut once. With VR, there may be cost on the front end to build the simulation, but once it is done, the simulation is like anything digital—you can make a billion copies, send it around the world with a touch of a button—and it lasts forever without degrading. In short, if a real-world experience is not impossible, dangerous, expensive, or counterproductive, then you don’t want to create it in VR. You might even consider having the experience in the real world. 2. Don’t make people sick If you decide to create something in VR, not getting people sick should be your primary concern. Good VR feels great. It is fun, engaging, exciting, potentially transformational. But a problem known as simulator sickness—the nasty physical reactions that occur when virtual and real perceptions don’t align—is an absolute deal-breaker. I worry that a few very public instances of this malady could sabotoge the entire VR movement. When I first started working in the field, we had an incident at UC Santa Barbara. A woman in her 40s participated in an experiment and got a small case of simulator sickness. Back then, bouts of sickness were fairly common: We were only running at an update rate of 30 frames per second (compared to 90 now) and the latency—the lag between head and body movements in the VR world compared to the real world—was very high, producing a disconcerting gap that can confound the senses. After a short time the woman said she felt fine. We said goodbye to her, and she left the lab. She drove home and parked. But while walking from her car to her doorstep, she got dizzy, fell into a fencepost, and hit her head. My colleagues and I were horrified at the thought that we might have contributed to this woman’s fall. As it turned out, she suffered no serious injury, and there were no legal consequences. But it was a reminder: Avoid simulator sickness at all costs. Designers should also be careful to build systems where users control when the field of view moves. Moving it automatically can have stomach-turning consequences. At a recent trade show, I watched one of the largest automobile companies give simulator sickness to one CEO after another. They put the executives inside simulated cars and drove them around sharp turns, accelerating and decelerating and putting their vestibular systems through a crash course in disorientation. Why was VR driving such a strain on the senses? Short answer: Poorly designed virtual reality messes with the systems humans have evolved for physically navigating through space. For hundreds of thousands of years, when a human has moved, three things have happened. First, optic flow changes. This is a fancy way to say that if you walk closer to a rock, the rock gets bigger in your field of view. Second, your vestibular system reacts. For example, sensitive structures in the inner ear vibrate when you move, sending signals to the brain that you are in motion. Third, you get proprioceptive cues from skin and muscles, information that tells your brain where your body is in space. Driving in VR wreaks havoc on these systems. The drivers at the trade show were seeing the road zip by with the proper optic flow, but they didn’t get the correct vestibular cues because their bodies weren’t actually moving with the car as it whipped around turns. They also didn’t get the proprioceptive cues that would cause them to feel pressure from the seat back on their back muscles and skin as the car suddenly accelerated. 3. Be Safe Good VR causes people to forget they are still in the physical world, and that can be dangerous. In the process of running VR demos, I have had a 70-year-old man randomly attempt to do a backflip and fall into my arms. Famous journalists have sprinted full speed at physical walls. A Russian businessman almost hit me in the head with a roundhouse kick, and a famous football coach smashed his hands against a podium to swat at a sprinting virtual player. Ultimately our lab is safe because we always have a vigilant spotter on hand, a person whose job is to watch every move of the user and catch or restrain him if necessary. Of course, the “spotter” solution will not work at scale. I like to joke that most commercial packages don’t come with me. (I am very proud of my spotting skills.) Instead, they come with guidelines, for example, “Please sit down while playing this game,” or scanning systems that often (though not always) warn you about walls. It will only take a few horrifying—and highly publicized—accidents to derail the VR revolution. So here’s my advice to anyone trying VR at home: Whatever energy you plan to put into safety, triple it. One way to bolster safety efforts is to keep VR simulations short. Think about some of your most memorable life experiences. Did they last for hours or mere minutes? In VR, the dictum “less is more” is especially true. Given that most VR simulations are intense—emotionally engaging, perceptually harrowing, and psychologically compelling—five to 10 minutes is often enough. Nobody knows what the future holds for VR. The best we can do is try to understand how it works and what it’s capable of, and then imagine how these factors can meet our needs and desires. Who would have thought that one of the most popular uses of the powerful phones we carry around with us would involve sending text messages and tweets—the type of information that a 19th-century telegraph could handle? Who would have thought that the most elaborate game interface ever invented, the Microsoft Kinect, would not supplant a traditional Xbox gaming controller? If the internet is any guide for how VR will evolve, most people will not just become VR consumers but VR producers as well, the same way people blog, upload YouTube videos, and tweet. As the technology improves, the range of ways people can express themselves in VR will be bounded only by their imagination. Some of it will be unsavory. While I wholeheartedly agree with the US Supreme Court’s determination that digital simulations are protected free speech, I also believe that just because we have the freedom to build anything we want, doesn’t mean that we should. We should strive for more than pure sensationalism or escapism in our entertainment. We can make the world a better place—if you’ll forgive me the Silicon Valley cliché—if we respect the unique power of the medium and focus on the prosocial aspects of VR. However it shakes out, it’s a very special time to be a part of this technological revolution. The coming years are going to be a wild ride.

"“There are no more cats and dogs alive”: the starvation crisis in Madaya, Syria.  In July 2015, forces aligned with Syrian leader Bashar   began laying siege to the Syrian town of Madaya, cutting it off from the outside world, including its access to food supplies. By early January, residents had been reduced to eating grass and insects. They had already eaten the city’s stray cats and dogs. At least 23 people died from starvation.    Late on Monday, that siege appears to have ended  —   for the moment  —   as the first humanitarian assistance trucks, permitted entry under an international agreement to help Madaya, rolled into the city. But it’s still too early to celebrate: Aid trucks had been let into Madaya in October, and the siege was reimposed afterward. But more fundamentally, no agreement can really prevent this kind of starvation from happening again, either in Madaya or in another Syrian city, because this is not a phenomenon specific to this one town but applies widely across the war. The only way to make sure this never happens again is for Syria’s war to end. Why Madaya is starving    Medic in starved #Madaya says people eating herbs in water with salt to survive, stray dogs and cats already eaten pic. twitter.   —   Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) January 8, 2016       Madaya is a town with a prewar population of 40, 000 people in western Syria, near the Lebanese border and the Qalamoun mountain range. Before the war began in 2011, Madaya was a   resort town. Today it’s in the middle of a war zone: Madaya is near the capital, Damascus, and thus is a valuable link between Assad and his Hezbollah allies in Lebanon.    Syrian rebel groups have held Madaya for some time, and the regime has had them under some degree of siege since July 2015. But in September, things got worse: Hezbollah forces moved into Zabadani, a nearby town. They didn’t take the town outright, and still haven’t. But Zabadani is Madaya’s ”only real lifeline to the outside world,” as Vice’s Avi   puts it. So the fighting there effectively shut off Madaya from bringing in supplies such as food. Since then, Madaya has been under siege by Assad and his Hezbollah allies. They were deliberately attempting to starve out the rebel fighters who held the town: Aside from a brief period of truce in the fall, no supplies were allowed to go into Madaya. That includes humanitarian deliveries such as food.    ”Since [a] single   food distribution on 18 October, this has been tightened to a total stranglehold siege,” a January 7 press release from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) explains. By   the situation had gotten really bad. According to Syria Deeply, rice was so scarce that a mere pound cost $250 (you can buy 20 pounds at Walmart for $9). A container of baby formula costs $300. People in   Madaya couldn’t afford that, and so had to scavenge  —   or starve. Between December 1 and January 7 and in   hospitals alone, 23 people died of starvation. ”There are no more cats or dogs alive in the town,” Rahman, a Madaya resident, told Al Jazeera. ”Even tree leaves that we have been eating have become scarce.”    The current agreement is not enough to stop this from happening again             On January 7, the Assad regime caved to international pressure and agreed to let aid into Madaya. It wasn’t clear that it would actually follow through on this pledge until the first aid trucks rolled into Madaya on Monday evening. But the town’s anguish isn’t over. According to the World Food Program, the aid trucks only have enough to feed 40, 000 people for one month. That means that even if Madaya’s population has fallen to half of its prewar total, the town will need another shipment in two months. If the Assad regime decided it didn’t want Madaya to get any more food, it could cut off the town again. ”This is a very positive development. But it must not be just a   distribution. To relieve the suffering of these tens of thousands of people, there has to be regular access to these areas,” Marianne Gasser, the Red Cross spokesperson in Syria, told Al Jazeera. In order to actually make Madaya’s residents safe from hunger, the world would need to negotiate an end to the fighting in Zabadani  —   which seems tough, considering the city is currently held by five factions (including  ’s Syrian branch). And even then, you’d need to get Assad and Hezbollah to foreswear sieges. That points to the real problem here: the civil war. When you’ve got an ongoing civil war, where multiple factions are willing to employ extreme brutality to achieve their ends, civilians are always at risk at being starved out by the enemies of the side that controls their town. In a very literal sense, Madaya’s problems are national ones. According to the UN, roughly 400, 000 Syrians are besieged around the country. Starvation isn’t as extreme in most places as it is in Madaya, but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen elsewhere.    To make matters worse, it’s not just the Assad regime that’s besieging civilians. As the New York Times explains:  Nearly half of the 400, 000 Syrians the United Nations counts as besieged are surrounded by government forces, who have used the tactic systematically around Damascus and Homs. The largest group is encircled by the Islamic State, which is blockading 200, 000 people in Deir   in the east. Other insurgents, mainly the Islamist group Ahrar   have also encircled more than 12, 000 people in isolated   towns in northern Syria, like Foua and Kfarya.  That means there’s no guarantee that international negotiations can solve the problem if this happens again in another town. The only way to prevent more Madayas, then, is to end the civil war.

"A not-so-modest climate proposal: why not just buy out the US coal industry?.  Consider two key facts about coal in the United States:     First, coal mining and burning is still a major contributor to global warming, responsible for about 25 percent of America’s overall greenhouse gas emissions.  Second, the coal industry is shrinking rapidly, getting crushed by both new air pollution regulations and competition from cheap natural gas and renewables. Back in 2008, coal provided fully half the country’s electricity. Today it provides just  . And that’s expected to keep shrinking as we tackle climate change. Bad news for coal miners.  Now let’s consider a recent and rather radical proposal for addressing both of those issues simultaneously. The case for simply buying out the US coal industry In a recent Washington Post   Stephen Kass, a lawyer in New York, floated this bold idea: ”The federal government should buy coal plants, shut them down and pay to retrain their employees.” Here’s the longer version:  Under Plan A, the federal government would buy or, if necessary, seize under eminent domain all existing U. S. coal plants and close them over 10 years. Such a use of federal authority is   and would not be subject to serious legal challenge. (Plant owners could dispute the amount of compensation offered but not the public purpose of federal action intended to protect the environment.) Plan A would include fair,   compensation for   shareholders and generous severance, relocation and   programs for employees, who should not be asked to bear the burdens of emissions reductions. Once authorized by Congress, Plan A could be carried out before the legality of the Clean Power Plan was finally adjudicated and long before it could be implemented.     The basic rationale is that this would reduce US power plant emissions more quickly and more certainly than President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which is currently on hold and bogged down in litigation and is dependent on state cooperation. What’s more, a buyout would help the workers who’d be affected by the dislocation.    The pros and cons of a coal buyout Kass’s   isn’t a fully   proposal  —   it’s more of a conversation starter than anything else (especially since Congress isn’t going to enact this anytime soon). But it’s an intriguing idea, and one that’s been circulating a few times over the years (see this piece by Robinson Meyer arguing that   billionaires should buy up and retire US coal reserves). So a few broad thoughts on this: 1) In theory, yes, this would be a huge step for climate change. Even in its diminished state, coal remains a huge source of carbon dioxide  —   responsible for about 77 percent of emissions from America’s electricity sector in 2014:               If we replaced all that coal with cleaner natural gas overnight, CO2 emissions from power plants would fall 40 percent. And America’s overall CO2 emissions would fall 14 percent. (You’d almost certainly get some offsetting methane emissions from leaky gas wells and pipes, though.) If you subbed in renewables or nuclear or hydropower for natural gas, emissions would fall even more sharply. Enough to meet America’s   climate goals. 2) Kass doesn’t offer an estimate for how much it would cost to buy out the US coal industry, but it wouldn’t be cheap. A few years ago, Felix Cramer and Gil Friend floated a similar proposal and estimated it would cost $50 billion to buy the nation’s coal plants and mines. If anything, that seems low. The federal government would also have to take over the billions in (unfunded) obligations that mining companies have to reclaim damaged land, plus pensions for miners, and so on. 3) The biggest cost, meanwhile, would be in replacing all that   power with alternative energy sources. That would fall largely on utilities and consumers, particularly those in   states like those in the Midwest. Think of that this way: The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the Clean Power Plan will cost $8. 4 billion a year in 2030 and cut coal generation by 20 percent. To reduce coal by 100 percent, presumably it’d cost at least five times that much  —   and probably much more, given that natural gas prices would rise more sharply with the increased demand and it would be even tougher to scale up renewables that far that fast.    4) On the flip side, any discussion of costs should acknowledge that coal burning itself imposes heavy costs on society that aren’t typically accounted for: deadly particulate air pollution, water contamination, climate damages, and so on. Back in 2011, a study in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences pegged these externalities at $300 billion to $1 trillion per year. You can quibble with the numbers, but there are undoubtedly huge benefits  —   particularly health benefits  —   to ending our reliance on the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. (Again, assuming we can replace all that electricity.) 5) Another wrinkle here: Our options aren’t just ”coal buyout” or no ”coal buyout.” We should also consider other climate policies to reduce emissions. Many economists would prefer to rely on   carbon pricing that would give companies incentives to curtail CO2 wherever they find it most  . There’s heaps of academic research to suggest this would be the cheapest path forward. 6) Then again, there’s no real precedent for a major economy eliminating coal burning through a carbon tax. By contrast, we do have precedent for a   coal phaseout. Over the past 11 years, the Canadian province of Ontario has shuttered all 19 of its coal units   —   which once provided   of its electricity  —   and replaced the electricity using nuclear reactors, hydropower dams, and renewables. Oregon is also winding down its coal use by legislative mandate. That’s the model here. Economists may not find regulations quite as elegant, but they’re also much simpler and easy to understand. 7) Any coal buyout would almost certainly be a lot messier than Kass suggests in practice. First, it’d have to be approved by Congress  —   and, while he makes a case otherwise, it’s highly doubtful that Republicans would go for this. Many environmentalists would also chafe at the idea of forking over money to coal utilities. It flies against the whole ”polluter pays” principle. Plus, countless lawsuits would arise over who has responsibility for things like the mining messes that the coal industry has left behind. 8) Historical footnote: On Twitter, Kalee Kreider notes that a coal buyout was actually floated in the 1990s in discussions between   Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd and the Clinton administration  —   back when the government was running a budget surplus. But it never went anywhere and died when George W. Bush came to power. 9) As Kass points out, if the government is going to shut down the coal industry, it only seems fair that we take care of the 75, 000 coal miners and 100, 000 employees involved in coal plants and transportation that would be hurt by the switch. He suggests providing money for retraining and relocation. But that’s easier said than done. As Dwyer Gunn reports in Pacific Standard, the federal government’s track record on job training is pretty dismal. In the past, many programs simply haven’t worked at all. (This is something to keep in mind with any climate policy: It’s worth noting that Hillary Clinton has a $30 billion plan to revitalize coal communities.)    10) Putting all my quibbling aside, Kass is onto something. Right now, the Obama administration is yanking on various regulatory levers trying to nudge down US emissions bit by bit. Some power plant regulations here. Fuel economy standards there. A crackdown on methane leaks. Hillary Clinton is planning to extend this   approach. The aim is to push down US emissions modestly  —   26 percent below 2005 levels by 2020  —   as part of broader global climate efforts under the Paris deal. Right now, given the gridlock in Congress, incrementalism is about the best anyone can hope for. But if we really want to make a dent in global warming, we’ll eventually have to think about truly drastic cuts in emissions  —   think 80 percent by midcentury. And that means thinking much, much more creatively about how to get there. Read more: 11 maps that explain energy in America  ",-1.0

It’s highly questionable whether anyone emerged as the winner in Thursday’s Republican presidential debate in Detroit, though the candidates’ spinmeisters would all quibble with that. There was one clear loser: the Grand Old Party. The 11th debate of the Republican campaign tested the patience and the limits of viewers and voters. Insults and interruptions overwhelmed sober discussion. The raucous audience, now a staple of the GOP debates, only added to the sense of   politics. Can anyone credibly suggest that the Republicans put their collective best face forward Thursday night? At a time when the party is in crisis over the possibility that Donald Trump will become the nominee, the debate did next to nothing to make Trump or his three remaining rivals look or sound presidential. Designed to define candidates’ differences, the debates have become tedious and repetitious rather than enlightening or illuminating. No new information was imparted Thursday, no truly new arguments advanced. Even the insults were tiresome.

"LaVar Ball: I don’t care if my sons call their mom a ‘b—h’. LaVar Ball’s confounding parenting tactics go beyond the   dynamics he’s made his life. He also advises his sons on how to treat  —   or, if they want, mistreat  —   their mother. The brash basketball father, who shared a rare moment of vulnerability in May when he   dove a little deeper into the role of the one member of the Ball family who’s stayed out of the spotlight. Following Ball’s twisted logic, the three sons apparently learned to refrain from misogynistic insults against their mom only so they could get what they needed from her. “I told them, ‘If you’re going to be disrespectful to your mom, I want you to be all the time.’ So, excuse my language right here, but if you want to say, ‘Good morning, b —  ’ that’s fine with me,” Ball   at the family’s home in Chino Hills, Calif.. “I’m not going to say nothing. If you want to call your mom a b —    that’s fine. But don’t get sick, when your stomach is hurting and you want me to care for you because you know I ain’t.   …     She’ll clean up the   the s —  t, whatever. She’ll take care of what you want.   …     So don’t wait until you need something, or you need her to make you something, and now you want to be nice to her.   …     “So they never disrespect their mom or talk back to her or say nothing. Because I say, ‘In the long run, you’re going to need her before you need me. ’” When it came to the boys breaking   rules, LaVar said he had no problem using physical punishment  —   “a couple of hits upside the head” to   Lonzo after he missed curfew and had a   with police or using a “belt or something” on youngest son LaMelo  —   before quickly backtracking. “I spanked them once,” Ball said as clarification, “to let them know there are repercussions at times. But my boys are respectful, and usually my voice is enough. ” Ball’s voice has been ringing in the ears of the basketball world since son Lonzo emerged as a star guard at UCLA and an expected   pick in the NBA draft on June 22. Tina, meanwhile, has been trying to regain her speech after she suffered a stroke in February that hospitalized her for about three months and damaged her verbal abilities. Ball said he’s been monitoring Tina since she returned home and feels confident he can restore her strength while their sons continue doing what they were raised to do: play basketball. “Like I told my boys: ‘I got her. Now you can do whatever you want to do. What I’m not going to is burden you with sitting there rubbing her hand.   …     We’re not making a movie,’” he said. “That’s my wife, and I take care of her. She wants to talk, and she can get out a few words. I’m rebooting her now right now. She’s saying, ‘LaVar, you’re right. You are right.’ That’s all I want to hear her say. Now we can get another 25 years having a good time. She is going to get better with me. ” Although Tina won’t be feeling well enough in time to attend the draft, Ball said, there’s no doubt in his mind Lonzo will wind up a Laker. And that assumption is only the first part of the equation. Next up in Ball’s wildly optimistic mind:    LiAngelo and    LaMelo will go “  ” and find their way to Los Angeles at any cost. “I’m going to do the same thing with Melo,” Ball said. “And we get three of the Ball boys on the Lakers together, and we gonna go championship, championship, championship, championship, championship.

"Antonio Bastardo Houdini’s Mets out of jam and into win. SAN DIEGO  —   For his next trick, Antonio Bastardo will skydive without a parachute. The veteran reliever probably felt as if he could pull off that stunt Sunday, after walking the proverbial tightrope without a net. All the lefty did was enter a   jam in the eighth inning with nobody out and escape without a run scoring to preserve the Mets’   victory over the Padres at Petco Park. Matt Harvey had his best outing of the season, but the hero was Bastardo, who made his most important pitches since arriving to the Mets last offseason on a   deal worth $12 million. “If it wasn’t for him, I don’t think we would have won the ballgame,” Yoenis Cespedes said after his team beat the Padres for the second straight game to finish with a split in the series. The Mets moved into first place, a   ahead of the Nationals in the NL East, but that is barely a blip on the radar right now. “It’s only May,” manager Terry Collins said. “We’ve got a long way to go. ” Bastardo, facing three straight righties, threw exclusively fastballs and got the Padres to chase. After Jerry Blevins and Addison Reed combined to allow three straight singles to begin the eighth, Bastardo  —   who hadn’t pitched since Tuesday  —   entered and worked his magic: Derek Norris struck out, Melvin Upton Jr. popped out to first base, and Alexei Ramirez struck out. Jeurys Familia then recorded his 10th save in as many chances with a perfect ninth. “The goal was to not give up a hit,” Bastardo said. “I just tried to throw every pitch with intensity and just not leave anything for the hitters. At some point, they were waiting for something else, but we still got them with the fastball. ” Bastardo, according to Collins, was the best option against the three righties because of solid career numbers against players such as Norris and Upton. “If he throws strikes, he’s got a chance to get a   or certainly a strikeout and get out of the inning,” Collins said. “I didn’t expect him to strike two guys out, but he certainly did that. ” This one wasn’t a cakewalk for the Mets even before the   drama, as Jim Henderson balked home a run in the seventh to pull the Padres within one before escaping further trouble. In his sharpest outing of the season, Harvey ( ) went six innings and allowed two earned runs on four hits with a   10 strikeouts and two walks. The best sign for the Mets might have been his scoreless sixth after surrendering a   homer to Christian Bethancourt an inning earlier. “All the work that we’ve been putting in, it’s just going out there and attacking the zone and going after guys,” Harvey said. “It was definitely a difference from the last couple of starts. I felt good on the mound and was able to execute pitches when I needed. ” Though the Mets had a streak of six straight series victories snapped, they managed a split in the   set and will continue their longest road trip of the season Monday in Los Angeles. Harvey had appeared to escape a fifth inning in which the Padres already had scored twice to slice the Mets’ lead to   but bounced strike three to San Diego pitcher Andrew Cashner, who raced to first base as Kevin Plawecki chased the pitch to the backstop. Cashner then was thrown out at the plate to end the inning after a Jon Jay double. Though Cashner appeared to elude Plaweki’s tag  —   fans chanted “safe” as the play was reviewed  —   the call was upheld, preserving the Mets’ lead. Harvey’s overall performance was more than acceptable. “It’s the best command I have seen him have this year,” Collins said. “He’s got such good stuff that they are swinging because they don’t want to get behind. When he made pitches, he got easy outs, and that’s how he normally pitches. ”",1.0

The Real Deal: For those paying attention to Star Wars chatter online, there's been a noticeable rise in chatter from certain folks claiming that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is in deep trouble, with Disney unsure about what even happens in the movie at this point. (We're not going to link to such reports, because why reward such bad faith rumormongering?) The reason we mention all of this is because, simply, it's not true. Director J.J. Abrams is on record as saying that the last sequence in the movie was decided early on in the filmmaking process, and he told MarvelousTV at D23 Expo that the movie has actually been unusually unchanging during editing. ""It's really been a bit unusual in that the editing process, much of what we have in the third act is exactly what we always had. And that's not always the case,"" he said, after clarifying ""the ending is the ending."" Well, we say clarifying, but it's not as if anyone outside of Abrams and the editors really know what that ending is just yet. Nonetheless: Don't believe reports of Disney being unsure about Rise of Skywalker. The Source: Anonymously sourced fan Instagrams Probability of Accuracy: Prepare to be cynical, but not necessarily dismissive … The Real Deal: Could this be the Rise of Skywalker rumor mother lode? Perhaps, but that'll only be the case if these predictions all turn out to be true. The Bespin Bulletin Instagram account had a pretty bold set of potential spoilers recently, claiming that by the end of Rise bot Kylo Ren and General Hux will have found redemption, with the latter being a Resistance secret agent when the movie opens. As for Kylo, the report suggests that he will eventually team with Rey to fight off the true villains of the piece: Palpatine and the Knights of Ren. Oh, and not only will they share Anakin's lightsaber at some point—no, we're not sure which one, and he went through a bunch in the prequels—but Palpatine himself is going to be using a lightsaber too, which suggests that he's, you know, more than just a Force Ghost in the new movie. To be honest, a lot of this sounds like wish fulfillment and fake spoilerizing (especially that both Hux and Kylo will be redeemed), but it's also hard to rule all of it out. For now, treat it with suspicion, but bear it in mind as the movie gets closer and more footage gets released. The Source: More anonymously sourced fan rumoring Probability of Accuracy: Unlike the last rumors, this has an air of truth to it, but that may simply be wishful thinking on our part. The Real Deal: Here's another rumor about The Rise of Skywalker—and one that, while unrelated to how the major events of the plot will go down, will nonetheless thrill fans if it turns out to be true. According to the ever-productive Making Star Wars, Rey will have found a new mentor in the ways of the Force at the beginning of Rise, and it's a surprise selection that only makes more sense the longer you think about it: Leia Organa will, apparently, be seen in the opening of the movie training Rey, with part of that scene apparently showing up in the D23 Special Look trailer. (It's Rey throwing her lightsaber, supposedly.) Given the secrecy surrounding what the late Carrie Fisher's role in the movie will be, don't expect this to be confirmed or refuted before the movie's release, but for want of a better way to put it, it feels right. And isn't the Force all about thinking less and feeling more? The Source: Teases offered by those working on the show Probability of Accuracy: File under ""This might be a Monkey's Paw situation."" The Real Deal: So, what exactly is The Mandalorian about, beyond simply looking really cool? According to show creator Jon Favreau and writer/director Dave Filoni, it's at least partially concerned with the rise of the First Order in the unexplored time gap between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. ""This doesn't turn into a good guy universe because you blew up two Death Stars,"" Filoni told Entertainment Weekly. ""You get that the Rebels won and they're trying to establish a Republic, but there's no way that could have set in for everybody all at once."" Favreau added, ""Also, what could happen in the 30 years between celebrating the defeat of the Empire and then the First Order? You come in on Episode VII, [the First Order are] not just starting out. They're pretty far along."" The rise of the First Order has been alluded to in various pieces of Star Wars ephemera before now—not least of which being Chuck Wendig's Aftermath novel trilogy—but it'll be interesting to see if The Mandalorian presents the fullest picture to date about what transformed the Empire into its current evolution, or if these teases will just lead to, well, more teases. The Source: The TSA, of all things Probability of Accuracy: As ridiculous as it seems, this is all real. The Real Deal: In what might be one of the least anticipated stories of the year, the Transportation Security Administration surprised many when it banned Star Wars fans from packing the specially designed Coke bottles from Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in their luggage because the fake thermal detonators looked too much like real detonators for comfort. The ban came because, it was explained, the packaging is a replica explosive, and replica explosives aren't allowed on planes. Faced with no small amount of fan uproar and just a little bit of ridicule, the TSA changed its mind a week later, confirming that it had ""completed our review, and instructed our officers to treat these as an oversized liquid."" As such, bottles can be packed in checked luggage or emptied and placed in carry-on bags. Now just wait for guidelines on lightsabers.",0.0
"Ever wake up to a numb, dead arm? Here’s what’s happening..  Waking up in the middle of the night to discover one of your arms has lost all feeling is frightening.    At first, the limb is limp and flops around like a useless bag of bone before coming back to life with a flood of ”pins and needles” sensations. When this happened to me as a kid, I panicked, thinking I’d done something horrible to my body, anxious that I’d never be able to move my arm again. But the feeling in my arm always came back. This phenomenon is really common, says James Dyck, a neurology researcher with the Mayo Clinic. And it’s actually a cool example of how the body can protect itself even during the paralysis of sleep.    Dyck explained there’s a common misconception that pins and needles and numbness are caused by a lack of blood flow to the nerves. ”The more likely thing is nerve compression  —   nerves are being pushed on and squashed, and that causes these symptoms,” he says.    You have several nerves in your arm. Each serves a vital function.            The axillary nerve lifts the arm at the shoulder. The musculocutaneous nerve bends the elbow. The radial nerve straightens out the arm and lifts your wrist and fingers.    The ulnar nerve spreads your fingers. Although Dyck says the exact physiology isn’t completely understood, the effect of compressing any of these nerves in sleep  —   when you sleep on top of your arm or pin it underneath a partner  —   is like stepping on a garden hose. The information that flows from your extremities back to your brain is temporarily disrupted. So why does it feel paralyzed upon waking? Dyck suggests two reasons. 1) It is actually, temporarily, paralyzed. During REM sleep, the brain sends a signal to cause a   paralysis. The purpose of this is to keep you from acting out dreams (which occur during REM). But if you wake up during one of these phases, you can be conscious before your fully regain control of your limbs. This is called sleep paralysis, and it can be a frightening situation. You’re stuck somewhere in between dreaming and wakefulness, and you can’t move. 2) The nerve compression has led to a temporary paralysis (perhaps because you got stuck in a compressed position during REM).    Compressing nerves can damage them. The good thing is that the body will naturally wake up as a protection mechanism when a nerve has been compressed too long. After you wake and relieve the pressure, the nerves will quickly come back online, usually first with a    feeling. ”The nerve structures, as they recover, tend to be irritable for a period of time,” the University of Rochester Medical Center explains. ”That’s because the nerves are firing spontaneously. Most of the time, the feeling of pins and needles is a good sign. It is a temporary phase that means nerves are coming back to life.” Someone who falls asleep on a limb is unlikely to do major damage to the nerves, Dyck says. But there are some cases when compressed nerves can become a greater problem. One such case is called ”Saturday night palsy,” when a person falls asleep compressing a nerve while drunk. The alcohol impairs your body’s ability to wake you up and protect your nerves. ”If you’re passed out drunk, you won’t move your arm,” Dyck says. And when you wake up the next day, you can’t extend your wrist and you can’t extend your fingers.” That might last longer than a few moments (perhaps even a few days or months) as the nerve has to repair its protective coating. And then there’s hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to nerve compression injuries. They might want to be extra careful not to fall asleep on a limb or even cross their leg to avoid nerve compression. (Carpal tunnel may also cause tingling or numbness in limbs at night.)    Again, for most people who wake up to a dead limb, it’s just a temporary annoyance.  And it ”probably takes less time [to recover] than you think it does, because you’re freaking out about it,” Dyck says.  Late sleeper? Blame your genes.        ",-1.0
"Rio 2016: You can do anything you set your mind to. Except for Simone Biles’s floor routine..    Simone Biles is the most dominant female gymnast in recent memory, possibly history.    For the past three years, she’s won every team and individual   competition she’s competed in. At the Olympics, she maintained that record, helping the American team to gold as well as wiping the floor during the individual competition. She also added a gold medal in vault and a bronze on balance beam. And on Tuesday, Biles added a gold in the floor exercise, bringing her total to four golds and five medals in all. Biles scored a 15. 966, almost a   better than Aly Raisman’s 15. 5  —   a score good enough for silver. There is no event that showcases Biles’s strength and transcendent quality as a gymnast as much as the floor exercise. Here’s what makes her performance so special.    Biles’s third pass is superhuman In the floor routine, there’s a guiding physical principle that governs which tricks happen where: Because gymnasts get tired, they don’t save the best for last. Thus, the first tumbling passes on the floor routine are usually the most difficult. A good example of this is Raisman’s monster first pass (a roundoff, 1. 5 twisting layout, roundoff back handspring, tucked double Arabian, front somersault):                                       As gymnasts’ legs tire, the difficulty in their floor routines begins to decrease. And that’s where Biles is unlike any female gymnast on the planet.    Her third pass is a double twisting double back, which is as hard as many gymnasts’ first pass:                                       She is doing this third, and better than her competitors. It’s testament to Biles’s explosiveness and stamina that she throws this in during the second half of her program.    Biles’s first two passes are incredible too Though it’s Biles’s third pass that sets her apart and makes you question if she’s a superhuman gifted with endless endurance, her first two passes are magical too. They’re as textbook in the air as they are powerful. Biles’s first pass is a double twisting layout. Look at how high she gets and how extended her stretch is during the layout and the twist:                                       Then she follows up with a second, similar pass. The two layouts are there, but there’s a    . Because Biles landed this in competition, it was named after her:                                       Look at how high she gets, and how high she keeps going when the second layout happens. If there’s a knock on Biles, it’s that she has a tendency to cross her toes on her twists, but that’s nitpicking when it comes to a pass this massive.    Biles’s excellence on floor is how she can beat a stellar routine from Raisman with around   of a point to spare. It’s why she’s the best female gymnast on the planet and has been for the past three years. And it’s how she won herself another gold medal. Because of NBC’s strict policy against GIFs and video from Olympics, I made GIFs from video of Simone Biles and Aly Raisman’s Olympic tuneup events. They showcase the same moves and tumbling passes they performed in the Olympics. The gymnastics floor final will air on tape delay tonight in primetime.   Why do Olympians bite their gold medals?

"Italian prime minister resigns in populist revolt.   BRUSSELS  —     Europe’s embattled political establishment lost another round Sunday in its effort to thwart the   movement, as Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after voters rejected his constitutional reforms. But a   presidential candidate in Austria handily defeated his   challenger. The thorough rejection of Renzi’s referendum to streamline lawmaking was a significant boost for the country’s surging populist forces just weeks after Donald Trump prevailed in the United States. Renzi’s loss also risks unleashing financial upheaval in Europe’s   economy as Italy’s weak banks struggle to contain the fallout. But the surprisingly strong presidential victory in Austria for an elder statesman formerly of the Green Party suggested there were still some limits to a wave of   anger that began in June with Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and continued with Trump’s victory last month. A populist takeover of Italy is still an uncertain prospect, since Renzi’s   Democratic Party remains in control of Parliament and national elections do not have to be called until 2018. But much will depend on the makeup of the next government and how   Euroskeptic parties capitalize on their success. “I have not managed to reach victory,” an emotional Renzi said early Monday, conceding defeat at the Palazzo Chigi, his official residence. “My government ends today. ”    Austrian presidential candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leading member of the Greens Party, celebrates as election returns show him leading in the race. (Matthias  )   With 90 percent of ballots counted, 60 percent of voters rejected the reform, a drubbing that far outpaced opinion polls ahead of the referendum. Viewed narrowly, Sunday’s vote was actually in favor of the status quo, since the constitution will now remain unchanged. But the referendum to streamline the political system and diminish the role of the Senate long ago turned into a broader vote of confidence in Renzi, the youthful,   leader who portrayed himself as a lone warrior against Euroskeptic forces. Renzi, who took office in February 2014, always struggled to budge unemployment and improve the economy. The lead opposition to Renzi, the insurgent Five Star Movement, ran a spirited campaign against the prime minister’s reforms, joining forces with an unlikely   of allies, including some in Renzi’s own party. Many establishment politicians also questioned whether the reforms truly made sense as the country contends with grim prospects for growth and a wave of migration from Africa. Some said the changes were poorly written and, by removing checks on the prime minister’s power, could actually enable populists should they ever win the country’s top job. Italy, which has had 63 governments in the past 70 years, is no stranger to political chaos. What comes next will depend partially on Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who is charged with picking a new person to try to form a government, as well as with deciding whether to hold early elections. Elections are a key demand from the Five Star Movement, which is running a close second to Renzi’s party in the polls. There may also be economic consequences, with Italy’s shaky banks teetering amid the uncertainty. The euro dropped 1 percent against the dollar in early Asian trading following Renzi’s resignation, but many financial analysts cautioned against panic. In the wake of Renzi’s resignation, Italy’s mainstream political parties are likely to change voting laws to make it more difficult to rule without a wide coalition, diluting the possibility that an insurgent force could seize power in the next elections . That would be a further check against the Five Star Movement, although it would also further entrench Italy’s general political dysfunction. Renzi’s   opponents were trying to capitalize on a wave of skepticism about the ability of elites to deal with globalization and the long, painful effects of the economic crisis that started nearly a decade ago. Trump’s victory last month cheered the Five Star Movement, an insurgent   force that has support on the left and the right.   Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announces his resignation after voters struck down a referendum on constitutional reforms. (Andreas    Images)  “Today the arrogance that’s remained in power these last years has lost,” said Luigi Di Maio, who is expected to be the party’s candidate for prime minister in the next election. “So ends the era of shortcuts and tweets. ”     Sunday’s votes in Austria and Italy  captured the extent to which Europeans are as politically polarized as Americans, split on issues including immigration and free trade. In Austria, the   Freedom Party’s Norbert Hofer conceded the election on his Facebook page less than 30 minutes after polls closed; projections showed a surprisingly strong lead for independent Alexander Van der Bellen. The    statesman and former Green Party politician was winning by 53. 3 percent to 46. 7 percent with nearly 100 percent of the votes counted. The result was an unexpectedly clear victory for Austria’s beleaguered political establishment  —   one suggesting that the aggressive tactics and   campaign deployed by the Austrian   may have hurt more than they helped. Sunday’s election, in fact, was a rerun of one in May in which Hofer lost by 31, 000 votes, a result he successfully contested. His defeat on Sunday by a far larger margin, observers said, may suggest European voters’ unease with the comparisons of their politicians to Trump. It also seemed to rob the momentum from   leaders in France and the Netherlands who have called Trump’s victory part of a new “world order” they hope to join in elections next year. Following Hofer’s concession, he and Van der Bellen exchanged a long handshake for photographers in the Vienna studios of Austrian state broadcaster ORF. Van der Bellen credited his victory to a “broad movement” backing “freedom, equality and solidarity. ” His campaign manager, Lothar Lockl, saw the margin as evidence of a push against the nationalist tide by moderates. “A movement could be evolving here, which is not only for Austria, but can also bring about a change of attitude in the whole of Europe,” he said.   The race for the president’s ceremonial role held  high stakes. The position is constitutionally ambiguous, yet Hofer, who has decried Muslim immigration and free trade, vowed to beef it up  —   setting up a clash with the   government and the European Union. Freedom Party supporters on Sunday had hoped for a “Trump bump”  —   but it bumped the wrong way. “The Trump bump could always go either way,” said Reinhard Heinisch, a political scientist at the University of Salzburg. “The fact is, Trump is not very popular in Austria. ” Hofer’s campaign in Austria seemed to echo Trump’s, with   outlets spreading damaging fake news and Hofer and his surrogates taking aim at red herrings such as his opponent’s health. There were more allegations of dirty tricks on election day. On Sunday, Austria’s domestic intelligence service launched an investigation into a mass text message that stated that only Hofer voters should show up because polling stations were overcrowded. Van der Bellen supporters, the text said, should instead vote Monday  —   although polls would be closed by then, according to the Austrian daily Der Standard. The race was perhaps more important as a bellwether of   voter trends in Europe, where nationalists are poised to stage potent 2017 campaigns in France, Germany and the Netherlands. A Hofer victory would have potentially signaled the new electability of the far right. Indeed, the Freedom Party sought to leverage Hofer’s    demeanor that seemed to take the bite out of his harshest condemnations, such as that “Islam is not part of Austria. ” Still, while portraying himself as the face of a reformed far right, he persisted in courting a more extreme base. For instance, he wore a cornflower lapel pin  —   a symbol of German nationalism also used by the Nazis. Hofer on Sunday called for national unity following his defeat. Yet within his party, the attacks were already flying. The Freedom Party’s powerful chairman,   Strache, accused Hofer’s opponents of running a “massive fear campaign,” saying Green Party supporters of Van der Bellen had painted Hofer as “a Nazi. ”            Faiola reported from Berlin. Stefano Pitrelli in Rome and Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin contributed to this report.       ",-0.5

"‘The Communist Party is like the sun. Wherever it shines, it is bright.’ A look at political messaging during China’s Cultural Revolution..         (Sheila Zhao)  “The east is red, the sun is rising. From China comes Mao Zedong. He strives for the people’s happiness, Hurrah, he is the people’s great savior! Chairman Mao loves the people, He is our guide to building a new China Hurrah, lead us forward! The Communist Party is like the sun, Wherever it shines, it is bright Wherever the Communist Party is Hurrah, the people are liberated!” These are the lyrics of “The East is Red,” a song praising Mao Zedong that became China’s unofficial national anthem during the Cultural Revolution ( ). These are also the words that inspired the title of photographer Sheila Zhao’s latest project “The East was Red,” which examines the power and prevalence of political messaging in photography from that time. The project features poignant and charming found images taken by ordinary people in everyday life. But, for every pin, statue, poster or other aspect of political messaging, Zhao has replaced the content with the color red  —   a color intrinsically connected to the party and time period.  By both highlighting and hiding the Mao memorabilia, Zhao says her goal was “to focus one’s attention on the impact a political agenda can have on the everyday lives of a population and how much it altered the vernacular visual language of China’s history. ” Zhao, whose father is an avid antique collector, began collecting images from China’s past about two years ago. From flea markets to Beijing and Shanghai’s ‘antique cities’  —   large buildings where many vendors sell all sorts of antiques  —  Zhao sifts through photo albums or lost single images taken by unknown photographers to find compelling slices of life from China’s past. Soon after she began collecting these moments, she started @ChinaLostAndFound, an Instagram account that serves as a virtual album for these treasured mementos. As her collection grew, Zhao began to notice patterns of symbols in the images she gathered from the Cultural Revolution period. From posters to busts of Mao, she realized the ideology of the revolution was visibly tangible.  “Photography at that time was not only a form of recreation and   for the common person but also a way for them to show everyone else that they aligned with what Chairman Mao and the communist party was promoting,”  she told In Sight. “The East was Red” investigates and questions this behavior. It’s not just simply that a woman is wearing a pin or that a child is posing with a statue; it is that they are doing it in front of the camera.  Much like when people add a filter in support of a cause to their Facebook profile photos, the motive and sentiment are the same. It not only reflects one’s identity and passions but also what they wish others to perceive. After all, as Zhao believes, her project’s aim is not to show her opinion toward any government but to “make the audience aware of the power of a political party and how much its messaging can infiltrate into our lives. ”    (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)         (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)     (Sheila Zhao)         (Sheila Zhao)  Related Links: Poignant portraits show what it’s like being LGBT in China These heartbreaking photos show what it’s like being a migrant in China ‘I buried my negatives in the ground in order that there should be some record of our tragedy.’ The photographs of Henryk Ross.",-0.5
"Trump just announced he’s betraying his biggest campaign promise on China.  For years, Donald Trump has been fixated on taking China to task for manipulating its currency in order to give its goods an edge over competitors in global markets. He complained about it back in 2013 when he was a private citizen, and on the campaign trail he constantly vowed that he would put an end to it.     ”On day one of a Trump administration, the US Treasury Department will designate China a currency manipulator,” he wrote in a Wall Street Journal   in 2015. In his Contract With the American Voter describing his plan for his first 100 days in office, he pledged: ”I will direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.” Well, it ain’t happening. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Wednesday, President Trump said that he wasn’t in fact going to deem China a currency manipulator. “They’re not currency manipulators,” he said, explaining that the Treasury Department won’t be blacklisting China in a hotly anticipated Treasury report that comes out this week.    What caused him to change his mind? According to the Journal, there are two main reasons: Trump said he believes China hasn’t been manipulating its currency for months, and he’s worried that labeling it as such would interfere with his ability to cooperate with Beijing on the threat posed by an increasingly belligerent North Korea.     It’s difficult to overstate how big of a policy reversal this is for Trump  —   and how much relief it will bring to economic observers across the world. If the administration had labeled China a currency manipulator, it would have required the Treasury Department to open negotiations with Beijing to try to get it to change its currency and trade practices. If a satisfactory solution wasn’t reached, the US government would’ve had license to impose tariffs on China. That in turn could have been the opening salvo of a trade war between the countries.    So what about Trump’s rationale for his change of heart  —   is it right? Sort of. He’s correct in his observation that China is no longer suppressing the value of its currency (although that’s been going on for years, not months). As for whether this move will encourage China to cooperate with the US on North Korea, that’s a lot less certain. A fair number of experts will tell you that trying to connect two completely disparate policy issues isn’t an effective negotiation tactic. China intervenes in its currency  —   but right now that’s a good thing Beijing’s central bank actively tries to move the value of Chinese currency, the renminbi (also called the yuan) by buying or selling foreign currencies. That’s in contrast to many advanced economies like the US, which have a floating exchange rate, where the price of the currency is largely determined by supply and demand for it relative to other currencies (although it can be influenced by other factors as well, like a country’s macroeconomic policies).    China spent decades suppressing the renminbi’s value to keep the country’s colossal export machine competitive. It bought up tons of foreign currency, mainly dollars, in order to keep its own currency lower, accumulating $4 trillion worth of foreign exchange reserves by 2014. (When you buy a ton of currency, its value appreciates, and your own currency depreciates relative to it.) By keeping the renminbi’s value low, China ensured that its goods remained inexpensive in global markets  —   and made foreign imports into China more expensive. But China’s growth is slowing, foreign investors are pulling out of the country, and now the pressure on the renminbi is going the other way. In the past two years, Beijing hasn’t been suppressing its currency  —   it’s been intervening in order to prop up the currency. China’s foreign reserve has dropped from $4 trillion to $3 trillion in just the past two years as the country has sold off foreign currency to keep the renminbi from depreciating too swiftly.  In other words, China is actively making sure its currency isn’t dropping, which makes its products more expensive than they would be otherwise. It also makes US exports more affordable to Chinese consumers. Trump is desperate for help on North Korea As recently as February, Trump appeared to be under the illusion that China was suppressing its currency. But it seems he’s rather suddenly been brought up to date. One factor that may have helped expedite that process is North Korea’s relentless ballistic missile testing and pugilistic rhetoric, which has much of the global community on edge. The Trump administration is deeply concerned with figuring out a way to get Pyongyang under control and to ultimately get it to give up its nuclear weapons.     Trump has decided that the best way to do that is with the assistance of China  —   North Korea’s economic lifeline and only major friend in the international arena. And China has in recent months signaled that it is willing to play ball  —   in February, the country announced it was cutting off coal imports from North Korea.  But China is reluctant to push Pyongyang too hard economically, because it fears that could lead to serious instability or even total regime collapse in North Korea. If that were to happen, it would almost certainly trigger a massive exodus of poor, starving North Koreans fleeing over the border into China. It also could lead the US to increase its military presence in the region while moving to secure North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Trump’s pitch is that China should be more likely to work with the US on disarming Pyongyang if he decides to be kinder on trade than he once threatened. There’s certainly a logic to it, but negotiations in disparate policy domains don’t necessarily bleed into one another in that manner.      “Linking such distinct issues seldom works because each involves different actors and different interests in each system,” Evan Medeiros, head of Asia research at Eurasia Group and a former top China adviser to President Barack Obama, told the New York Times when discussing the idea of Trump linking trade and North Korea. Sure, China doesn’t want a trade war, but it also doesn’t want to see the collapse of Pyongyang. Having one of those preferences met doesn’t negate the other.  Just as it was difficult for Trump to get Beijing to budge on the One China policy or extract any kind of economic concession during his first meeting with China’s president, he’s likely to run into more obstacles in cooperating on North Korea than he anticipated.

"After 13 years, CIA honors Green Beret killed on secret Afghanistan mission.      When Nathan Ross Chapman became the first military casualty to die by enemy fire during the war in Afghanistan, the only American flag available for his casket was a patch torn off the uniform of an airman loading his coffin for the long trip home. He was buried on Jan. 11, 2002, a week after his death, with full military honors in Tahoma National Cemetery, Wash. It took another 13 years for the CIA to recognize on its Memorial Wall that Chapman, an Army Green Beret, was also one of its own  —   the sergeant first class had been officially detailed to the agency in the weeks after the   attacks and died acting as a CIA paramilitary team’s communications specialist. Chapman’s death was a watershed event for a country that didn’t know it was headed into a seemingly endless war, where the news of those lost would turn into a kind of white noise for many Americans. The first of its kind in Afghanistan, his death drew national attention, including a televised funeral. Much of Chapman’s story and that of the secret agency team he was assigned to has never been told, and the agency continues to say nothing about him.    SFC Nathan Ross Chapman (Photo courtesy Chapman family)  At a ceremony at CIA headquarters on May 18, 2015, the agency unveiled an engraved marble star to mark his death in the line of service, but like many others in the wall’s accompanying Book of Honor, his name was left absent. The addition of that star for service in 2002 prompted The Post to examine the background to the honor, and why it had taken so long to be conferred. In the years after Chapman died, the agency honored at least one other service member, a Marine officer killed in Iraq in 2007 while detailed to an agency paramilitary unit. The Marine was later memorialized with a star, yet it took more than a decade for Chapman to receive his place on the famed wall. “We didn’t even know anything was going on relative to that star; we didn’t expect it and we didn’t know anything about it,” Chapman’s father, Will, said during a recent interview in his home in Texas. He said the recognition from the CIA was part of his son’s final chapter, and he was grateful for it. It also recognizes the pivotal role that Special Operations forces played with the CIA in the early days of the Afghan war. Following the memorial ceremony in 2015, CIA Director John Brennan, along with his deputies, privately met with the Chapmans on the agency’s seventh floor. He apologized for the long wait but gave no explanation for why it took more than 13 years for Chapman to get his place on the wall, the father said. “He just said it should have been done a long time ago. ” The CIA declined to comment. Chapman, 31, left behind a wife, Renae, and two children, Brandon and Amanda, who, at the time, were 1 and 2 years old. Renae Chapman was unavailable to comment for this story. A veteran who jumped into Panama as a Ranger and who served in Iraq and Haiti, Chapman was also a qualified combat scuba diver and sniper. Among his peers he was known as a consummate professional and as the life of the party with a penchant for quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Chapman had transferred back to Fort Lewis, Wash. from Okinawa just before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “America’s going to war over this,” he told his father in the weeks that followed. “And they’re not going without me. ” “And then he was gone,” the elder Chapman recalled.    Letter from Nate Chapman to home. Written in Panama circa 1990 on piece of cardboard that was duct taped shut and mailed. (courtesy Chapman family)  An unconventional team of elites Built like a linebacker with a square jaw, narrow eyes and a sly smile, Chapman went to war as a member of what the CIA called Team Hotel  —   a   unit composed of three Special Forces soldiers, two CIA paramilitary officers and a CIA contractor. Chapman and two other Green Berets were selected from more than 1, 300 soldiers in 1st Special Forces Group. For their mission in Afghanistan, the CIA needed communications specialists and medics, and almost immediately following the   attacks it tapped 1st Group to help fill that requirement, said Lt. Gen. David Fridovich, who was, at the time, the group’s commander and a colonel. Chapman’s assignment to Hotel reflected the agency’s rapidly expanding relationship with the U. S. military, according to Henry Crumpton, the leader of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center task force that led the war in Afghanistan. It was a relationship born out of necessity in order to field an effective unconventional force in a new and entirely unconventional war. After purchasing thousands of dollars in outdoor supplies from area sporting goods stores and requesting the weapons and equipment the team would need in Afghanistan, the six men spent the remainder of October bouncing between the CIA’s Camp Perry  —   better known as The Farm  —   in Williamsburg, Va. and the agency’s headquarters Chapman was responsible for assembling the team’s communication equipment. At the time, the process of interfacing satellite radios and computers was a new discipline, but it was something Chapman had already mastered. He was known throughout 1st Special Forces group as the best in his field, earning the reputation during repeated deployments to places like Thailand and Malaysia with special forces teams. Aside from setting up the radios, Chapman was also instructed on a computer program called ArcView  —   a piece of software that allowed CIA and military units to see what was happening on the battlefield in real time. “He never took himself too seriously, even with all the crap we were throwing at him,” said Ken Stiles, the CIA targeting officer for all of the agency’s operations in Afghanistan. In the   to Hotel’s departure, other CIA and Special Forces teams had already been scattered throughout Afghanistan. Team Jawbreaker, the first element to go in, had linked up with parts of the Northern Alliance fighting the Taliban, along with teams Bravo and Charlie. Team Echo had made contact with future Afghan president Hamid Karzai. In December, teams Juliet and Romeo would go into Tora Bora, hoping to corner Osama bin Laden in the craggy mountain passes near the Pakistan border. But before Hotel would join its sister elements in Afghanistan, Chapman and the rest of the team would first fly to Jacobabad, Pakistan. The team soon began trying to work a deal with the Pakistani military to get to their side of the border south of the Afghan city of Jalalabad in an attempt to box in and find bin Laden, according to Scott Satterlee, a special forces medic detailed to Hotel with Chapman. With the Pakistani military demanding more training and equipment than the small team was able to provide and offering little knowledge of the lawless border region where Hotel was trying to go, the deal fell through. As things unraveled in Pakistan, U. S. and Afghan forces seized Kabul and, just days after Thanksgiving, Team Hotel left Pakistan for Afghanistan’s capital. Hotel would stay in Kabul for roughly a month, spending Christmas there. A detachment of operators from Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, would bring the team to 11 members for an upcoming mission in Khost, a rugged town on Afghanistan’s eastern border. Christmas was the last time Chapman called home, his father recalled. He didn’t tell them where he was, just that he was safe. He passed the phone around to his mother Lynn, and to Keith Chapman, his older brother who was recently married. His grandmother and grandfather also managed to get on the line. “I said to him at the end of the conversation, I’m sorry you’re not able to be with your family,” his father said. “I know, Dad,” he replied. “But I’m with my second family, and they’re a great bunch of guys. ”    A copy of this painting was given to the Chapman family and signed by members of Team Hotel following Chapman’s death. It depicts a standard CIA operation in the early days of the war in Afghanistan (Courtesy James Dietz)  Behind enemy lines Roughly a week later, Hotel loaded onto one of the CIA’s     helicopters and flew the 90 miles to Khost. According to Satterlee, the agency had to pay its way into the town, offering large sums of money to one of the tribes in exchange for admission and some protection. Hotel would go in and “plant the flag” for the CIA and deny   a base of operations, according to a CIA officer present during the team’s operations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a covert operation. They were the first Americans there since the war began. The team set up, along with some of their newly acquired Afghan escorts, a rudimentary base of operations in an old Russian schoolhouse in the middle of town during the final days of the year. The night before Chapman’s death, a small   element from Hotel slipped into the darkness to conduct reconnaissance on an abandoned Soviet airfield a few miles away, returning after taking   fire. The airfield would later be named after Chapman and was the site of a suicide bombing that killed seven CIA employees in 2009. The next morning, cold and cloudless, Hotel’s team leader along with a senior CIA officer who had been sent to the area held a meeting with some of the tribal leaders at a nearby abandoned government building. The meeting started poorly, according to the CIA officer. The tribe’s representatives erupted into heated argument, but after tea and a pledge by the CIA to help rebuild the town, the meeting closed on somewhat good terms, said the officer. That afternoon, Hotel loaded into four white Toyota Hillux pickup trucks along with a handful of Afghan escorts and headed to what they thought was an   safe house located in town. The agency had intercepted communications coming from the building. “Us being there wasn’t accomplishing anything, besides maybe getting us into more trouble,” Satterlee said.    Two Afghans inside Team Hotel’s Khost safe house circa 2002. (Photo courtesy Scott Satterlee)  The team got back in their trucks and headed down one of the only paved roads in Khost. As they came into town, the road turned into a wash. The first three trucks went down and out and headed back toward the schoolhouse. As the fourth truck dipped into the culvert, now roughly a hundred yards away from the next vehicle in the convoy, three men opened up with Kalashnikovs, each dumping their entire magazines into the last truck from roughly 30 feet away. In that truck’s bed was Chapman, a CIA paramilitary officer and the team’s lone CIA contractor. An Afghan was driving. Two rounds slammed into the paramilitary officer’s chest, tearing through his extra ammunition magazines and his soft body armor. The bullet that killed Chapman shattered his pelvis and severed his femoral artery. It was unclear who returned fire, said Satterlee, but when they inventoried Chapman’s gear later that day, the magazine in his M4 carbine was empty with its bolt locked to the rear  —   evidence that he had expended every round he could before collapsing from blood loss. Chapman and the paramilitary officer slumped down, and the Afghan driver gunned it, making it back to the schoolhouse in just over a minute and half. By the time Satterlee and the rest of the team got to the back of the truck, it was awash in Chapman’s blood, and he was unconscious. With the agency’s lumbering   transport helicopter flying from Kabul  —   a roughly   flight from Khost  —   the team worked furiously to keep Chapman alive. Satterlee did the best he could by stuffing the wound with gauze while another team member knelt on Chapman’s navel. But five minutes before the Russian helicopter touched down in a wheat field next to the school, Chapman stopped breathing. The paramilitary officer, although severely injured with multiple sucking chest wounds, would survive. Satterlee helped slide Chapman into his sleeping bag and loaded him into the back of the helicopter. It was 5 p. m. Jan. 4, 2002. It is unclear exactly who shot Chapman and why. According to Satterlee, the gunmen were part of one of the tribes trying to extort more money from the Americans for protection, while the CIA officer interviewed for this article said they were possibly linked to the Haqqanis  —   a powerful faction that had already sworn to fight the United States and would continue to fight U. S. troops for years to come. “He always knew how to find his way into the action,” his father said. “That’s why he went in the military, to do this stuff.   …     But he knew the risk involved. ” The Army awarded Chapman a Bronze Star with a V for valor, and the CIA would posthumously give him an intelligence star, according to his father. The U. S. Special Forces Association in Thailand renamed itself after Chapman, and a mural of the slain Green Beret adorns the wall of their headquarters. “The mystique went away, and reality showed up when Nate died,” said his former teammate Sgt. 1st Class Jason Koehler. “It took the Superman   from everyone of us who thought we were invincible. ”  ",-0.5
"The comic book movement that gave us the era of the superhero movie.  In most tellings, the current age of superhero movies began in earnest in 2000, with Bryan Singer’s  . That relatively modest film, built around a pair of classically trained Brits and an Australian actor with a background in musical theater, proved that audiences would turn out for reasonably faithful adaptations of classic comic book stories. And it set in motion a new wave of superhero films  —   from Sam Raimi’s   series to Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy to Marvel’s   catalog of Avengers and   blockbusters, not to mention a host of   efforts.    These days, hardly a month goes by without a major superhero release, and studios are betting their entire future on an   number of comic book movie universes.   Related  How Marvel built such an impressive movie universe    Of course, while that history of the modern superhero movie isn’t wrong, it largely ignores the role of comic books themselves, which over the years have served as a sort of testing ground for the types of storytelling devices and thematic questions that now dominate both the box office and the public’s   conversation. In particular, it glosses over a strain that emerged in the late 1990s that became known as ”widescreen comics.” Widescreen comics were a reaction to the talky, cartoony superhero comics of the 1990s, many of which were mired in a kind of   ’70s revivalism, and which often had more in common with soap operas and professional wrestling than with epic Hollywood tentpoles.     They were drawn to mimic   visuals, with wide panels that looked like   screens. The essential idea was to emphasize grand spectacle and visual storytelling, to insist that comic book creators should take advantage of their ”unlimited budgets”  —   as afforded by the fact that comic book action was illustrated on the page, not CGI’d on the screen  —   to create   action that Hollywood, due to the limitations of finances and effects technology, could never afford to produce.    One of the first widescreen comics, The Authority, laid the track for the superhero films we know today The touchstone for this movement was the DC Comics series The Authority, by writer Warren Ellis and artist Bryan Hitch. The pair had previously worked together on Stormwatch, which served as a predecessor to The Authority, converting the series from a     superhero team story into something edgier and bloodier  —   an unapologetically violent, intensely political series that questioned the morality of the entire business of being a superhero, asking whether superheroes, as traditionally imagined, were really doing any good at all, or just serving powerful interests.   The heroes of Stormwatch ripped off people’s arms and engaged in sexually explicit banter, and the series finale involved a standoff between the titular superheroes and the president of the United States over the acquisition of alien weapons technology  —   then closed with the team losing its sanction as the United Nations pulled its funding. It wasn’t exactly realistic, but it was attuned to world affairs, and it grappled with the cultural questions of power and politics that the existence of superheroes in our own world would inevitably raise.    Launched in May of 1999, The Authority expanded on Stormwatch’s ideas, building its stories around massive destruction and tough questions about superhero ethics. In an interview that coincided with the release of the first issue, writer Ellis described the series’ ambitions to journalist Matt Springer:  Property destruction on a massive scale. It’s a superhero book gone widescreen, it’s $200 million just on the special effects, it’s a Jerry Bruckheimer production with script by Sylvester Stallone, Cecil B DeMille and Timothy Leary. It’s as big and mad and beautiful as Bryan Hitch and I can make it. If teenagers need superhero comics, then this is what they should be like  —   pure bloody adrenaline, strange days, and big things blowing up. And why not?”  In that short quote, you can identify the seeds of the modern superhero movie, and in the   run that Ellis and Hitch went on to produce, it’s even more apparent: The action is intense, the destruction is epic, the conflicts larger than life.    Hitch’s artwork is far more realistic than the exaggerated, often goofy style that dominated comics in the early 1990s, with a greater sense of drama. Page layouts are simpler; many feature just a handful of panels that stretch all the way across the page, in roughly the same aspect ratio as a movie theater screen. Hitch makes frequent use of a technique known as ”decompression,” in which the story is conveyed largely through visuals, without much dialogue, and brief moments are spread out across multiple pages of art. The result was a sweeping, grandiose, inherently cinematic comic  —   just as Ellis had promised. At the same time, Ellis’s story continued to engage with cultural and political affairs, often by upending the tropes of comics themselves. Two of The Authority’s male heroes, Apollo and Midnighter  —   who were essentially   for Superman and Batman  —   were lovers, and the book was built on the question of where its heroes would derive their authority from in the absence of a UN mandate. In many ways, The Authority was a critique of the entire genre of superhero comics. After a dozen issues, Ellis and Hitch turned The Authority over to a new creative team, writer Mark Millar and artist Frank Quitely, who proceeded to further amp up the book’s political commentary, pitting its heroes against dictators and governments, even leading to a handful of instances in which panels were altered by the publisher, over Millar’s objections, because they depicted unflattering images of George W. Bush. The movement’s signature story elements included   destruction,   and pointed political commentary Millar’s run on The Authority proved as influential as it was controversial, and he quickly became one of the comic book industry’s stars. He jumped ship from DC to Marvel to launch the ”Ultimate Universe,” an alternate Marvel timeline unbound from the main comic’s continuity that was intended to give new readers a starting point. His main project was The Ultimates  —   essentially an   series that updated the Captain   Avengers with a more modern sensibility, including reimagining Nick Fury as a black man who looked suspiciously like Samuel L. Jackson, long before the actor was cast in the role. Joining Millar on The Ultimates was former Authority artist Hitch, who once again contributed a cinematic look whose visual identity was defined by realistic characters, widescreen page layouts, and   destruction. In these comics, you can see the foundation of the modern superhero blockbuster As in The Authority, there were also elements of satire and   with the various Avengers recast as    versions of themselves, and   politics on the mind.    In what is probably The Ultimates’ most famous moment, Captain America beats the snot out of a villain and points to the A on his forehead while bellowing, ”You think this letter on my head stands for France?” It was both an exaggerated joke about Captain America’s unfailing patriotism and a winking nod toward the American political discourse in the wake of the Iraq War, when congressional cafeterias briefly started referring to French fries as ”Freedom fries.” After The Ultimates, Millar moved into Marvel’s primary universe. In 2006, he took the lead on the comic book version of Civil War, which, as in the recent movie, pitted a team of heroes led by Captain America against a team of heroes led by Iron Man over a question of political oversight following a   catastrophe  Related  Marvel’s Civil War and its politics, explained    Civil War was another widescreen epic concerned with both politics and superhero ethics, and it served as a sort of culmination of all the ideas that had started in The Authority. It was an   spectacle about superheroes and their relationship to the government, one that dealt with the challenges and tradeoffs inherent in their   mission to do good and protect the innocent. In these comics, you can see the foundation of the modern superhero blockbuster; the gigantic scale, the intensity of the drama, the emphasis on visual storytelling, and epic conflict are the most obvious points of influence. And more recent superhero films illustrate how the sort of   and   that loomed over widescreen comic stories has crept into superhero movies as well: This year’s surprise hit Deadpool was a hyperviolent,   breaking, comically      of the superhero film. Batman v Superman dealt with question about superhero morality, especially with regard to the collateral damage caused by superhero action. Civil War tackles some of the same ethical questions, and makes global oversight central to its conflict. Ellis, Millar, and Hitch, in other words, helped define what it means for a comic book to be cinematic, and in the process, helped pave the way for comic books to make the leap to the big screen.    There is a distinction, however, between their visions and the ones that now rule Hollywood. What Ellis, Millar, and Hitch were doing was also a form of criticism  —   not only of superheroes and their blind spots, but of comics and their fans. Ellis, who started work on Stormwatch after the market for comics bottomed out in the   posed The Authority as a kind of corrective to the entire industry and its devotees, showing them not only what superheroes could be, but the cold and sometimes monstrous truth about what, in his view, they really were. That sort of grim   has yet to take hold in the world of superhero movies, which hasn’t experienced an extended bust cycle. But if the continued influence of widescreen comics so far is any indication of the future, it won’t take too long. ",-1.0
"Is ethanol really worse than gasoline? The debate, revisited..  Originally published on Grist. When I first looked at the environmental impact of corn ethanol, I thought it was simple: Growing an acre of corn for fuel means you have to grow another acre elsewhere for food, which ultimately means cutting down forests and releasing a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. Plus, even the Environmental Protection Agency said it was worse than oil. Then I dug a little deeper and realized it might not be as simple as it looked, and that the EPA estimates were rough and out of date. I promised to figure it out and report back.    Now I’m here to say that I have to eat my words about corn ethanol being worse than gasoline. That, however, doesn’t mean that ethanol is better than gasoline, either. Instead, that broad question (is corn ethanol always better than petroleum?) is impossible to answer in a fully convincing way. When I presented Dan Kammen, a respected renewable energy researcher, with my initial indictment of ethanol, he told me, ”You almost can’t be wrong, but you almost can’t be right.” That’s because it all comes down to indirect cause and effect, linked only by the action of the market’s invisible hand: A farmer in Iowa opts to grow corn two seasons in a row, rather than alternating corn and soy beans; at the same time, a farmer in the Brazilian Cerrado plows a new field for soy. Did one cause the other? The researchers I like to call the ”high counters” say yes, probably. The ”low counters” say probably not. And as the authors of this paper put it: ”Unfortunately, neither of these perspectives can be proved incorrect.” I want to assure you, though, that this isn’t a Schrödinger’s cat situation, where the truth is unknowable. Reading this post won’t leave you knowing less than when you started. The question ”is ethanol always  ?” is too broad to answer definitively, but we can narrow it down. If we are asking about massively expanding biofuel production to replace fossil fuels, then the high counters are clearly correct: That would cause deforestation and climate disaster. If, on the other hand, we are just asking about maintaining the corn ethanol production we have today, that’s probably a good thing, producing about 20 percent less emissions than switching back to oil.               That’s the conclusion Jeremy Martin, senior researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists, came to in a new report on transportation fuels. Martin is careful to point out that there are other problems associated with corn production that aren’t captured by the measurement of carbon  —   algae blooms from nutrient runoff, erosion, and habitat loss. Still, the US consumed 13 billion gallons of ethanol in 2014. A 20 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity in all that fuel is significant.    The great debate Scientists and policy wonks have been telling each other they are dead wrong about ethanol for more than a decade. Kammen started out on the   side: His lab published a paper in 2006 suggesting corn ethanol was better than fossil fuels. But then, in 2008, a pair of papers pointed out that any analysis of ethanol had to consider indirect   change. If growing corn for ethanol in Iowa meant that farmers had to convert more land into fields, that would completely wipe out the benefit of ethanol. In 2010, a group of researchers, including Kammen, did another accounting  —   this time including the effect of land use change  —   and they concluded that ethanol’s carbon footprint is the same as gasoline, or larger. Researchers are still volleying claims and counterclaims back and forth. Kammen told me it’s not because anyone is blind to the truth, or corrupt; they simply have deep differences in the way they model emissions and land use change. It’s like the debate over the different models of the atom, he said. New evidence helps refine those models, or suggests new ones, but we still don’t have a perfect model.    Witness, for instance, the chain reaction set off when the US Department of Energy’s Argonne National Lab responded to one of those seminal 2008 papers: It sparked this   from Princeton’s Tim Searchinger, to which Argonne in turn responded, prompting this rebuttal by Searchinger. That may look like an academic cage match, but it’s all in the interest of science: The criticism allows researchers to make their models better. By now, Martin told me, ”Most life cycle analyses of biofuel incorporate this concept of indirect land use change,” and researchers have been refining techniques to capture every bit of greenhouse gas emitted in the fuel production process. He was impressed by the California Air Resource Board’s assessment of ethanol. Determining California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard was a   process of listening to researchers from all across the spectrum, convening expert work groups, and finally putting the information together with     science. ”It’s quite a reasonable representation of the way things stand today,” he said. That representation suggests that even if we  include the impact of indirect land use change, the corn ethanol mixed with our gasoline today has 20 percent less greenhouse gas impact than oil.    How can you grow more corn without plowing new land? The argument that initially sold me on the notion that corn ethanol was an automatic loser was this: If you dedicate land to grow fuel, that means you’ve got to grow food elsewhere, and ultimately you will end up displacing plants that are already capturing carbon. So how can biofuels get around that? By increasing yields and displacing meat production. First, yields: If you grow a crop of corn that displaces an identical crop of corn, there’s clearly no benefit  —   each sucks the same amount of carbon dioxide out of the air. But if you take land that was producing, say, hay, and replace it with thick corn in the summer and then winter wheat that same year, you are producing a lot more vegetation, which sucks up a lot more carbon dioxide. All of that is happening against a background trend of increasing yields as farmers come up with new techniques and better technology.             Second, meat production: It sounds crazy to say that people will just eat less as biofuel production claims more land   …     unless you know that the majority of that land was producing food for animals. As ethanol production ramped up, it drove up the price of feed, which drove up the price of meat, and  —   though there may have been other causes as well  —   Americans cut back on eating animals. If you look at the big picture, farmers have increased the amount of corn they grow, but there’s been a   decrease in other crops, and across the US the total amount of farmland hasn’t changed much.            Of course, this is happening in different places  —   the ethanol boom led farmers in the Midwest to plow up a lot of environmentally sensitive land, at the same time that land in the Northeast and South was moving out of agricultural production entirely.    That’s just in the US  —   but we also have to ask if other countries are plowing more land to grow cotton and wheat as we dedicate less land for those crops here. Again, though there has been a tragic amount of forest cut down for agriculture in places like Indonesia and tropical West Africa, other areas are reforesting, and the total amount of cropland worldwide is just about flat.            If we tried to grow a lot more ethanol right away, then farmers would convert land to agriculture  —   there’s no doubt about that. But it’s another thing to ask what happens if we stopped growing ethanol corn. Would farmers in Iowa convert their fields to tallgrass prairie? Perhaps some, but it seems more likely that they’d grow livestock feed. Continuing  —   as opposed to increasing  —   the production of ethanol shouldn’t cause more land conversion to agriculture. Ethanol isn’t going anywhere Whether you are a high counter who thinks corn ethanol is terrible or a low counter who thinks it’s great, it’s here to stay. Today, 10 percent of the gas going into our cars is ethanol, and even if lawmakers repealed the Renewable Fuel Standard  —   which mandates that we mix that 10 percent into our gas  —   the percentage wouldn’t drop. That’s because refiners have come to rely on ethanol to raise the octane of gasoline. As NPR reporter Dan Charles explains:  Octane is a measure of gasoline’s tendency to ignite under pressure. If it’s too low, the   mixture in an engine’s cylinders will burn too soon, creating damaging ”knocking.” The industry standard for gasoline is 87. But getting gasoline’s octane rating up to that standard costs money. It means more refining of the petroleum, or using   compounds in your gasoline formula, such as  —   you guessed it  —   ethanol. So gasoline companies aren’t using ethanol for its energy  —   they’re buying it for its high octane rating.  You could also use lead to boost octane, but we decided against that after figuring out that it’s a serious poison. You could use   butyl ether (MTBE) but we ditched that in the 1990s because it seemed to be contaminating groundwater. Finally, you could build more complex refineries to process oil until reaches a higher octane without ethanol. But that would be expensive, Martin told me, and it’s not likely to happen anytime soon. At this point, Martin said, there is no reason to end the Renewable Fuel Standard: There’s demand for corn ethanol even without the government mandate, so the ethanol haters wouldn’t get their wish even if you repealed the rule. In addition, the Renewable Fuel Standard creates a huge incentive for people to figure out how to   cellulosic ethanol. ”As more advanced cellulosic ethanol becomes available there’s a market for it,” he said. If that happens, farmers really could convert cornfields to tallgrass prairie, then cut the grass and turn it into fuel.    So it looks like corn ethanol is much more legitimate than I initially thought, and the measurement of its carbon intensity more complicated. I should have interviewed more experts and read more    science before publishing that first piece. The road to knowledge  —   at least in my case  —   often winds through the valley of ignorance. I never know exactly where I am along that road, but I do keep walking. Grist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues.

"Stephen Colbert tries to get Donald Trump to drop out — by appealing to his ego.  Donald Trump’s victory speech on Tuesday for Michigan and Mississippi devolved into a bizarre infomercial about former and current Trump products that Mitt Romney had insulted. And while many of Trump’s claims during the speech were (as usual) factually questionable, they did provide Stephen Colbert with a major insight.    Colbert said on Wednesday’s The Late Show:  I think I know what’s going on here. Donald is just insecure. I don’t know if Trump even wants to be president. The guy just needs constant validation. That’s clear. And isn’t that what all of us want? Love? Just love and maybe steak? And if we just give that to him, maybe he’ll go away. So Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump  —   and I know you’re watching because I said your name three times  —   I just want you to know that everyone thinks you’re cool. Okay? You’re smart. You are good at companies and businessing. And no doubt you are hung like a pool noodle. Oh, what’s that? Oh, what’s that? I’m getting a phone call. Hello? Oh, it’s everyone who’s made fun of Donald Trump in high school. What’s that? You were secretly jealous of him the whole time, and now you’re married to far fewer women? Okay, I’ll tell him. Goodbye, real call. Besides, Donald, you don’t need to run for president because there’s an even cooler, more elite position out there  —   and we’ve all voted that you are it. It’s America’s #1 man. And tonight, to make it official, I’m giving you the #1 man trophy.  Unfortunately, this probably won’t work. What is working, however, is Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination, which looks more and more likely to win with every passing primary election.

"This 1936 advice manual on living alone is smart, witty, and still helpful today.  The greatest advice book ever published was written by Marjorie Hillis, the editor of Vogue circa 1936. It’s called Live Alone and Like It, and it’s addressed to what was then a new social category, emerging in the aftermath of the Great Depression: bachelor ladies, or “the  ”  —   women who live on their own, without husbands or parents (but maybe don’t like it).     Sternly dismissing any attempts at    —   “Anyone who pities herself for more than a month on end is a weak sister and likely to become a public nuisance besides”  —   Hillis guides her readers through how to cope with life on their own. And while some of her advice is specific to the ’30s (the topics she covers include bed jackets and boarding houses) a lot of it holds true today. Below, I’ve collected my favorite pearls of Hillis’s wisdom. Some of it’s very 1936, some of it’s very 2017, but all of it sounds like what your favorite glamorous,     aunt would tell you to do. 1) Retain a healthy spirit of defiance  You’re living alone because you’ll show them, you’ll show them all, yes? Especially your enemies? You are glamorous enough to have enemies, aren’t you?    When you start to live alone, defiance is not a bad quality to have handy. There will be moments when you’ll need it, especially if you’ve been somebody’s petted darling in the past. But you will soon find that independence, more truthfully than virtue, is its own reward. It gives you a grand feeling. Standing on your own feet is extraordinarily exhilarating, and being able to do very well (when it’s necessary) without your friends, relatives, and beaux, not mention your enemies, makes you feel surprisingly benign towards all of them.    2) Bolster your defiance through schadenfreude  As illustrated in two cases. First, the case of Miss MacD.: For several years, she lived in an inexpensive   in Detroit, slipping in and out unobtrusively and growing more and more convinced that life was a very lonely business. Then through a series of coincidences she discovered that several girls in the firm where she worked earned even less than she did and got around no more. This cheered Miss MacD. immensely, just as it would cheer you.    Secure in the knowledge that she is not the saddest person she knows, Miss MacD. gets her own apartment, invites everyone she pities to dinner, and develops a crowd of friends. Then there’s the case of Miss P. who pours all her money into her beautiful apartment and has none left for entertaining. Faced with an old frenemy who’s in town for a visit, Miss P. wisely diagnoses herself with a noncontagious illness, takes to her bed, and invites her frenemy over for tea: When the guest arrived, she was ushered into Miss P. ’s bedroom, in which the late afternoon sun filtered through white Venetian blinds and fell upon a bowl of roses on a low mirrored table. Miss P. herself, perfectly groomed, was propped against pillows, wearing an opalescent white satin nightgown with Alençon lace and a   velvet  . The blanket cover on her bed was   too, with strips of lace.   …     When the guest left, practically wilted with envy, Miss P. reflected that the total expenditure had been two dollars for the maid, one dollar for the roses, and a very little extra for the tea.    Hillis knows the secret to life, and it is playing elaborate mind games to make sure that other people envy you as much as possible. 3) Make it your business to know something about everything How else will you convince the world that you are a fascinating person? You will probably have to muffle both   and telephone if you can put yourself over as a gay, interesting, and    person. Anyone can, if she has sufficient determination. You can’t sit at home and wait for these qualities to descend upon you like a light from Heaven, but you can acquire them by means of a little serious concentration on friends, hobbies, parties, books, and almost anything else that keeps you interested.   …     But you’ve got to have variety.   …     Every woman should have a smattering of knowledge about practically everything. 4) Seriously, get a hobby Even a charitable hobby, gauche as it may be. Be a Communist, a stamp collector, or a Ladies’ Aid worker if you must, but for heaven’s sake, be something. And preferably you should have two: You should have at least one that keeps you busy at home and another that takes you out. Just dabbling in them isn’t enough, either. They will not be really efficacious until you’re the kind of enthusiast who will stay home to follow the first type in spite of a grand invitation, or go out and follow the second in spite of wind, sleet, or rain. 5) It’s better to make your relatives think you’re a bitch than to make them think you’re sad and lonely If they think you’re lonely, how will you show them, show them all?    You can build up quite a coterie if you take enough trouble, mix your friends intelligently, and show a little shrewdness as to when to invite them, and what for. Include as few relatives as possible in one group, on the principle that it’s infinitely better for a Lone Female to offend her relatives by not inviting them enough, then to bore her relatives by inviting them too often. In other words, it’s better to be a snob than a  . 6) Pajamas come in varying levels of formality BRB, off to buy hostess pajamas. There are   …     sleeping pajamas, beach pajamas, lounging pajamas, and hostess pajamas. The first two are not designed to wear when receiving anybody, masculine or feminine. The last type is correct for wear when your most conservative beau calls, even though he belongs to the old school and winces when a lady smokes. The third variety comes in all sorts of shadings, from an   type to a practically hostess pajama. Those with a leaning towards the bed are suitable only for feminine guests, while the others would not shock Bishop Manning. (If you’re wondering, my best guess as to whom Hillis refers to as Bishop Manning is William T. Manning, the Episcopalian bishop, philanthropist, and noted hater of dancing. His views on pajamas are unrecorded.) 7) You do not own enough bed jackets Have you ever seen a bed jacket? It’s basically a bathrobe with the bottom part cut off. It’s the dowdiest piece of clothing you’ll ever see. Hillis loves them.  Don’t think that four   are too many.   …     A warm comfortable one for   use and a warm grand one for special occasions. A sheer cool one for summer mornings, and a lacy affair to dress up in. 8) Follow the gospel of Marie Kondo  Hillis was on top of the ”purge all your stuff” school of thought way before it was trendy.    The Great Temptation  —   well, anyway, one of them  —   to most people living alone is to have too much furniture and too many  . We’ve been in lots of feminine establishments from which you might have taken half the furnishings and given them to the nearest Thrift Shop  —   and achieved as much as if you’d called in a decorator. 9) That noise in the next room is probably not a robber Trust Hillis. She knows. When you wake up in the night convinced that you hear a man moving about in the next room, do not get up and investigate. Still more important, do not telephone the janitor, or a friend’s husband across the street, or your brother in New Jersey. Almost certainly, there is no man in the next room, and, if there were, he would be gone by the time anyone got there. 10) Don’t look for a bargain until you can recognize one Good advice for everything. Bargains in liquor, like bargains in clothes, are only for Those Who Know. While you are still learning, never buy anything but the best. (This is not a bad rule to stick to through life.) 11) If your apartment doesn’t have a kitchen, don’t worry, you can still keep booze in the house You just have to pick the right booze! Like Miss C.: As Miss C. cannot go in for cocktails, without ice, she has made a specialty of sherry, hunting up the best and keeping several variations on hand. The glüg, a delicious Swedish drink, hot and powerful, she keeps for guests who look upon sherry as effeminate. There are no instructions on what to do about preparing food without a kitchen.    12) Always have breakfast in bed Hillis informs us that “[i]t is probably true that most people have more fun in bed than anywhere else, and we are not being vulgar. ” So obviously bed is the best place to eat. Very well, then, have your   and black coffee and toast.   …     Our plea is merely for plenty of   coffee, and toast; really good   coffee, and toast; and   coffee, and toast attractively served. Of course, the civilized place for any woman to have breakfast is in bed. 13) Spending your own money is just as good as alcohol  Hillis preferred whisky. We are not advising you to save [money] for any good and moral reason, but merely because, as time goes on, spending your own money has a kick in it, like whisky, while having other people’s money spent on you has, at best, the tame pleasure of a glass of lemonade. 14) Above all else, have an elegant time Consider the example set by Mrs. de W. the widowed workaholic who spent her retirement focusing all her Type A energies on rejuvenating her body: She has her breakfast in bed, late, leisurely, and comfortably. She lets nothing crowd out her regular weekly appointments for a shampoo, a scalp treatment, a wave, a facial, and a manicure. Two mornings a week, she spends in a health salon.   …     And on nights when she is very tired she has a masseuse come and give her a long, soothing massage.   …     At a tea recently, she entertained the guests by standing on her head. Mrs. de W. is having an elegant time. ",-1.0

"I was skeptical that the anti-vaccine movement was gaining traction. Not anymore..  On March 31,   activists plan to march on Washington to defend what they call their “legal right to make informed, voluntary vaccine choices. ”    So far, a little more than 300 people have signed up to march with this group of pseudoscience promoters. But the “call to action” at this moment in history signals something alarming: The   movement seems to be energized under President Donald Trump. And that’s dangerous, given that lately, vaccine skeptics have been persuading more parents in a number of states to refuse shots for their children. The trend is worrying enough that two top vaccine researchers published   in the past month warning about the risk of more outbreaks of   diseases like measles and mumps. “Even a modest decrease in [vaccine coverage] rates could be enough to cause future outbreaks,” wrote Saad Omer, a leading vaccine researcher at Emory University, in a Washington Post opinion piece.    In another piece, Peter Hotez, a pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine, wrote, “I’m worried that our nation’s health will soon be threatened because we have not stood up to the pseudoscience and fake conspiracy claims of this movement. ”    They’re right to be concerned. We now have a president who courts known   crackpots like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and makes the same kinds of pseudoscience claims about lifesaving immunizations that they do. RFK Jr. is seizing on the attention, and holding a press conference today  —   with another   sympathizer Robert De Niro  —   to promote his well debunked theories about vaccine safety.  If there was ever a moment to fear the   could win, this is it.    Vaccine refusals are rising in many parts of the country because states have made it easier for parents to opt out  Let’s be clear about something up front: Most American children still get their shots. More than 90 percent of kids receive vaccines for polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and chickenpox, though the coverage rates are slightly lower for other routine vaccines. Most American parents also say they support   vaccine requirements.  States started to mandate that school children get inoculated against diseases because we need vaccination rates to remain high to sustain what’s called “herd immunity. ” For any vaccine to be effective and prevent outbreaks, a certain (high) percentage of people in a population need to be immunized. This keeps diseases from spreading easily, and keeps vulnerable groups that can’t be vaccinated (such as very young babies or people with allergies to vaccines) protected. And yet, since vaccination was invented more than 200 years ago,   have been organizing. The seeds of the modern   movement can be traced back to bogus 1990s research by Andrew Wakefield, a discredited   who linked the    vaccine to autism. Since then, a small but vociferous community of activists  —   abetted by doctors who enable them  —   have been spreading unfounded fears among parents about vaccine safety.    As David Gorski, a surgeon who has tracked the movement, wrote in a recent blog post, “  antivaxers are a minority. They are and remain cranks.   …     Unfortunately, they have an outsized influence on reasonable parents who just don’t have the scientific background to recognize their misinformation and pseudoscience for what they are, contributing to vaccine hesitancy. ”   A history of the   movement.  So how great is their influence? And is it growing stronger? In the past couple of years, there haven’t been any new   studies on national trends in vaccine refusal. But the latest evidence we have from individual states, in combination with older studies on vaccine coverage rates and recent surveys of doctors, suggest there’s a growing problem in several parts of the country.   The main way to measure how many kids aren’t getting vaccinated by choice is finding out which proportion of kids get exempted from school vaccine requirements for nonmedical  —   that is, personal belief or religious  —   reasons.  Since immunization laws are   there’s variation across the country when it comes to the requirements. As of August 2016, all 50 states have legislation requiring vaccines for students  —   but almost every state allows exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations, and 18 states grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs (with the exception of Mississippi, California, and West Virginia, which have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation).  Leah Samuel of Stat News crunched the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on nonmedical exemptions from 2009 to 2016 (her numbers, however, weren’t   like some of the other studies I’ll describe next). She found that the volume of people seeking exemptions was greater in 2016 than at any other point since 2009 in 11 states: Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia. She also found the national average for nonmedical exemptions was down in 2016 from a 2009 spike  —   a fact she attributes to California and Vermont’s 2015 cancellation of their personal belief exemptions.  Some of the best   evidence for an increase in the number of people refusing or delaying vaccines comes from Emory’s Saad Omer. In one 2009 New England Journal of Medicine paper, Omer looked at the   rates of nonmedical exemptions. He finds that between 1991 and 2004, those rates increased from less than 0. 98 percent to about 1. 5 percent. Again, this uptick was not spread evenly across the US, and even varied within states.              Generally, though, states that allowed only religious exemptions had a steady   rate of about 1 percent during the period (1991 to 2004). But in states that were more lax  —   allowing philosophical or personal belief exemptions as well as religious and medical exemptions  —   the mean exemption rate increased from 0. 99 to 2. 54 percent.     In a 2012   to that paper, also published in NEJM, Omer found  —   once again  —   that “  exemptions have continued to increase, and the rate of increase has accelerated. ”  Doctors are also reporting that they’re meeting more and more parents who are skeptical of vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics periodically surveys its members and identified a rise in pediatricians reporting that they had patients who refused a vaccine  —   from 75 percent in 2006 to 87 percent in 2013.  As for   analyses, Baylor’s Peter Hotez looked at the rate of nonmedical exemptions over the past 13 years in his home state of Texas. He found that in 2016, there were almost 45, 000 children who refused vaccines  —   about double the number of exemptions in 2010 and a   increase compared with 2003:              Texas is one of those lax states that allow parents to get both religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions. And other studies have shown that people who live in places that make it easy to opt out of vaccines tend to have higher rates of exemptions. In one paper, states that allowed parents to refuse vaccines for philosophical or personal reasons had exemption rates that were 2. 54 times as high as states that only permitted religious exemptions. Another older study, looking at data between 1991 and 2004, found an increase in exemption rates only in states that allowed philosophical exemptions.  The “vaccine hesitant” are more common than outright vaccine deniers There’s also evidence of another growing group of vaccine skeptics: More common than outright vaccine deniers are parents who might be better described as “vaccine delayers. ” They generally agree that vaccination is a public health benefit, and they don’t identify as ” .” But they’re hesitant and skeptical about some areas of vaccine science, and they work with doctors to create their own vaccine schedules, choosing which vaccines to give their kids and which to skip.     “There are numerically few parents who exercise exemptions entirely against all vaccines,” said sociologist Jennifer Reich, who studies the   movement, in an email. “But there is evidence that as many as 20 to 25 percent of American parents feel uneasy about the number of vaccines given, feel uncertain they are entirely necessary, and wonder if they are safe. ”  There are real public health consequences to these exemptions, too. As I reported last year, researchers have found that rates of whooping cough and measles are higher among people who are intentionally unvaccinated. Unvaccinated individuals were often ”patient zeroes” in state outbreaks, meaning they sparked disease clusters by creating pockets of susceptibility that caused others to fall ill.  Vaccine refusers are a hugely diverse group  —   but they do share some common characteristics  So who exactly are the vaccine refusers putting public health at risk? A politically and geographically diverse bunch, it turns out. “In Oregon, it’s an organic movement appealing to natural things and that we shouldn’t do unnatural things to kids’ bodies,” said Hotez. “In Texas, it seems it’s more about choice and civil liberties. ‘First they take our guns away, and now they’re trying to make us vaccinate our kids. ’” There are clusters of people who refuse vaccines for religious reasons across the country, too.             Overall, though, they do have some things in common. Most research shows that parents who reject some or all vaccines are more likely to be white,   and married, with higher family income. They also do so for personal reasons  —   which tend to be concerns about vaccine safety.  That squares with Reich’s findings. She interviewed a group of parents over 10 years to learn about their vaccine views, and found “the   ubermoms who favor organic food and have a tendency to avoid gluten and dairy products” were among the   according to Times Higher Education.    In an email, she told Vox that she thinks “these factors allow parents to feel they can manage illness and health without vaccines. ” In other words, families with more resources may believe they can deal with serious consequences that arise if their kids become sick. “They can afford to miss work, access hospitals, and feel best able to manage risks,” she added.  That’s just parents doing what parents do, Reich said: trying to make the best decisions for their kids. Unfortunately, their decisions aren’t rooted in science, and, she added, “Their efforts to protect their own children by avoiding vaccines may actually endanger [other people] in the community, including some who are most vulnerable to the worst outcomes of infection. ”  Trump may embolden the    —   but states have the power to push back  Every health researcher I talked to for this piece worried that President Trump’s seeming willingness to court   like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is emboldening the movement.  Infectious diseases doctor Paul Offit has linked the growing vaccine refusal to “[this] age where science denialism is institutionalized”  —   noting that several of Trump’s Cabinet picks hold views that are antithetical to science. “It’s just a world turned upside down. ”  “[Vaccine denialism] could get worse under Trump,” Omer said, “not only because of his rhetoric but because of the cuts to the public health funding,” referring to the fact that money for public health measures like immunizations is on the chopping block under the current Republican Congress.  The vaccine researchers also said that America’s public health community isn’t addressing the problem.     “The CDC, NIH, HHS  —   they don’t really want to talk about [vaccine refusers],” Hotez said. “They think if we don’t make a big deal of this problem, it will go away. ”  But both Hotez and Omer would like to see more outreach by public health officials into   communities, and see national leaders at least acknowledge the problem and defend the lifesaving value of vaccines. “Obama, Bush, Clinton, even with all the craziness around the Wakefield [vaccine autism] paper, didn’t really have much of a voice on [this issue],” said Hotez. “It’s frustrating for me. ”  This leaves ample space for the states to be more active on the issue. Again, we know that when state governments make it easier for parents to opt out of vaccines with different exemption provisions, they’re more likely to exercise that right. And lately, states have been doing a good job of fighting back against   forces. This 2014 JAMA paper is instructive. The researchers found that between 2009 and 2012, states considered 36 bills related to vaccine exemptions: 31 wanted to expand them, making it easier to opt out of vaccines, while only five wanted to make vaccine exemptions more difficult to obtain. None of the 31   bills passed, while three of the five bills clamping down on vaccine deniers made it, which suggests that while there was more activity from the   side, public health won out in state legislatures.  So states’ role in ensuring communities are immunized is more important than ever. They’ll need to be strong and organized under a president who is unlikely to be a champion of vaccines and a Congress poised to cut public health funding.  ",-1.0
"Mario Lemieux mad over messed-up Penguins sale. Hockey legend Mario Lemieux is miffed at billionaire investor   for messing up the sale of the Pittsburgh Penguins, The Post has learned. After six months of trying to sell the team, the two men  —   both significant minority owners of the NHL team  —   recently called off the sale, three sources told The Post. There were reports that Lemieux, who owns roughly 40 percent of the team, and Burkle, with a 25 percent stake, initially were looking to get more than $700 million for the Penguins and a development site, a source said. The team did attract a bid recently that Lemieux wanted to accept  —   but Burkle turned it aside, two sources said. “Mario believes Burkle messed it up,” a source close to a potential suitor said. “It is consistent with my understanding that [Lemieux] and Burkle had different asking prices,” a separate source said. The strategic review was prompted by Lemieux wanting a little liquidity, a source said. The team, if it makes the playoffs, is marginally profitable, sources said. However, if it misses out on postseason play, it operates in the red, a source said. Burkle, who Forbes in 2014 said was worth $3 billion, likely believed that if   then the Penguins and its real estate were worth more than $700 million, sources said. “I think what they asked for was just ridiculous,” a source said. “They thought they had NBA pricing, but the NHL doesn’t even have a significant national US television contract,” the source added. The value of the Canadian TV contract has fallen sharply alongside the Canadian dollar. The NHL likely, too, did not want to see the Penguins sell for much less than $700 million, considering the league is asking expansion teams to pay $500 million to join the league. A much lower selling price  —   especially for a storied franchise like the nearly    Penguins, who have won three Stanley Cups  —   could have put pressure on the expansion fee. Burkle, through a spokesperson, said, “There’s no truth to these rumors. ” Lemieux and the Penguins did not return calls. Since publication of this story, Ron Burkle and Mario Lemieux issued a joint statement that “There is no disagreement between us, and we remain completely aligned in both approach and philosophy. We continue to explore all of our strategic options, including a possible sale. There is not, and has never been, an established price for the team, and we are still in conversations with potential buyers. ”",1.0
"Chris Christie is super bitter about not being Donald Trump’s VP pick.        This post has been updated. Chris Christie, as you may have heard, wanted to be Donald Trump’s   pick. It didn’t work out.   [Video: 5 reasons Trump picked Mike Pence as his running mate]   Now the New Jersey governor is making very clear just how he feels about being left at the political altar.

Christie actually praised Pence, saying he was ”really relieved that Donald Trump picked a governor to be his running mate,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer report. That outburst comes less than 24 hours after Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was overheard by the Weekly Standard’s John McCormack talking about Christie’s state of mind. Here’s how McCormack described it: While minding my own business at the Starbucks inside the Westin hotel this morning, I saw a man engage Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort in conversation about the VP selection process. The man, whom I couldn’t identify, suggested that Pence was a smart pick and Gingrich would’ve been a disaster. ”Christie was livid, right?” the man said at one point. ”Yeah,” Manafort replied. Christie’s anger and bitterness shouldn’t be terribly surprising. As we’ve written in this space a million times before, no one risked more than Christie for Trump.   [Watch: Hollywood helps decode Christie’s silent scream]   He endorsed the real estate mogul in late February when it was still very much an open question as to whether Trump would win the nomination.

Chris Christie threw his support behind Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday, Feb. 26, saying Trump’s ”the best person” to run against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a general election. (Reuters)   Through it all, Christie stayed steadfast in support of Trump  —   insisting that he had known Trump for a very long time and that he thought The Donald was the best choice to be president. Even some of Christie’s closest allies struggled to understand what his fierce loyalty toward Trump  —   even as Trump seemed to treat Christie as a sort of affable fall guy  —   was about. The only conclusion anyone arrived at was that Christie has pushed all his chips into the center of the table on a bet that being Trump’s staunchest defender would be rewarded when it came time to picking a vice president. That bet wound up being a big loser. And Christie is just now coming to terms with the fact that he has flushed his political career down the toilet for, well, not much. If you think I am exaggerating about Christie’s future, check out these numbers in his home state.    (Philip Bump   The Washington Post)  In a word: dismal. And what does Christie have to hope for?  His best case scenario is a slot in a Trump White House  —   attorney general?  —   although given how Trump passed him over for VP, I’m not sure Christie should feel particularly confident about much in that regard.   scenario for Christie is he simply disappears into the political ether.  That would mark a stunning fall for someone who, as recently as four years ago, was seen as one of the brightest stars in the national party. So yes, Chris Christie is bitter.

"‘They friends of yours?’: Trump asks black reporter to set up meeting with Black Caucus.          Over the course of the lengthy and bizarre news conference that President Trump held Thursday, few moments crystallized the unusual nature of his presidency as effectively as an exchange he had at the end with April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks. Ryan asked Trump if he would include the CBC in discussions about his agenda for addressing urban policy. The CBC, for those unaware, is the Congressional Black Caucus, a group of African American legislators that is often a leading voice on the Hill for issues dealing with the black community. Trump appeared briefly to be unaware of what the initials stood for, and so Ryan asked more pointedly.   Trump to @AprilDRyan on the Congressional Black Caucus : ”Are they friends of yours?” pic. twitter.   —   Colin Jones (@colinjones) February 16, 2017   “Am I going to include who?” he asked. “Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus,” Ryan, who is black, asked, “and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as well as   …    ?” “Well, I would,” Trump interrupted. “Tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting? Are they friends of yours? Set up a meeting. ” Ryan pointed out to the president that she is a journalist and that, while she does know members of the CBC, that’s not her role. “I’m sure some of them are watching right now,” she added. Trump went on to say that he had been trying to set up a meeting with Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( .) the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and a CBC member. He then claimed that Cummings had balked at following through, but the CBC tweeted its side of the story.   Hi, @realDonaldTrump. We’re the CBC. We sent you a letter on January 19, but you never wrote us back. Sad! Letter: https:  .   —   The CBC (@OfficialCBC) February 16, 2017     [Cummings: “No idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today”]   This wasn’t the first   between Ryan and the White House. On Monday, Ryan accused Trump aide Omarosa Manigault of having physically intimidated her near the Oval Office and that Manigault claimed the administration was maintaining “dossiers” of information on members of the media. (White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied that this was the case in his daily briefing on Wednesday.) During the campaign, Manigault accused Ryan of being on the payroll of Hillary Clinton, thanks to a misinterpretation of an email released by WikiLeaks. This history is probably why Trump also told Ryan that her question was “very professional, very good. ” However, the weirdness of the   exchange on Thursday extends beyond the reporter’s relationship with the administration. Trump’s suggestion that a black reporter is somehow allied with or working on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus is fraught for obvious reasons, but also came shortly after Trump insisted, without being prompted, that he was not racist. “Racism: [I’m] the least racist person,” he said in response to one question. “In fact, we did very well, relative to other people, as a Republican. ” That’s misleading. He did better than John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012  —   both of whom were running against the first black president in American history. Otherwise, he did worse with black voters than any Republican candidate since exit polling began tracking the numbers.     But the rest of the question that prompted him to note that he isn’t racist is worth mentioning. Jake Turx of Ami Magazine, a publication with a Jewish readership, asked Trump about reports of bomb threats being called in to Jewish community centers.   . @POTUS says he’s the ”least racist person” pic. twitter.   —   POLITICO (@politico) February 16, 2017   “Number one, I am the least   person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” Trump responded, after calling the query “not a fair question. ” “Number two,” he continued, “the least racist person. ” When Turx tried to clarify the response he sought  —   which explicitly wasn’t about Trump being    —   Trump shot him down. “Quiet, quiet, quiet!” Trump told Turx, who was wearing a yarmulke. He summarized his lack of   by pointing to the embrace of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday. “You should take that,” Trump said to Turx, “instead of asking a very insulting question. ” Trump was asked about   on Wednesday, as well. He answered by talking about the electoral college.      At a joint news conference at the White House, Feb. 15, President Trump responded to a reporter’s question about the ”sharp rise” of   across the United States, saying, ”We are going to do everything within our power to stop   racism and every other thing that’s going on.” (Reuters)   It’s by no means the case that only black and Jewish reporters were subject to aggressive or unusual responses from Trump. It is the case that both Ryan and Turx earned responses that seemed to hinge on their cultural or racial identities: That Ryan might be friends with black legislators and that Turx should “take” the endorsement of Netanyahu. At one point Trump also said that he hoped to unify the “very divided” country as president. Black and Jewish voters overwhelmingly preferred his opponent. It seems unlikely that his responses today will improve his relationships with those communities. Update: The   League released a statement.

courtesy Warren Spector  Warren Spector spent 10 years playing Dungeons & Dragons with science fiction author Bruce Sterling, who was a brilliantly improvisational Dungeon Master. The players were free to do whatever they wanted, an experience so powerful that Spector spent decades trying to recreate it on a computer. He got his start working alongside visionary game designers Richard Garriott and Chris Roberts at Origin. “There was this real sense—it was tangible, you could feel it—that we were going to change the world,” Spector says in Episode 193 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “And that is a pretty powerful thing to believe.” Spector didn’t care for the Dungeons & Dragons computer games, which focused almost exclusively on combat. Instead he was drawn to Garriott’s Ultima series, with its focus on character and story. “He wasn’t just making what we called ‘Monty Haul’ dungeons,” Spector says, “where you would break down a door, fight the monster in the room, grab the treasure, and then break down the next door and fight the next monster and grab the next treasure. He was really telling stories that were about something.” In recent years Spector, Garriott, and Roberts all drifted away from game design, wary of the restrictions imposed by an increasingly large and corporate game industry. But the advent of crowdfunding allowed them to return to the field with projects like Underworld Ascendant, Shroud of the Avatar, and Star Citizen. Spector warns that crowdfunding is no panacea, but he says it does present options for game designers. “We’re seeing variety in games now that we haven’t seen in decades,” he says. “So it’s a pretty exciting time.” He hopes more game designers will focus on creating characters who can respond intelligently to anything that players say, which is the only way that video games will ever be able to replicate the experience of a tabletop RPG. “I have confidence that we’ll get there,” he says. “Someone’s going to figure out how to do—not perfect characters—but emotionally compelling characters that can contribute to a player’s story instead of a writer’s story.” Listen to our complete interview with Warren Spector in Episode 193 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. Warren Spector on cyberpunk: “Guys like William Gibson and a bunch of the other cyberpunk writers would come to town. Austin was a pretty happening place in the cyberpunk science fiction scene at that time, in the late ’70s, early ’80s. So it was a pretty cool time to be here. … There was this real sense that—they certainly felt it, and all of us around certainly felt it, that they were changing the world. They were rebellious and fighting against the orthodoxy of science fiction. I don’t know if they ever put it in these terms, but I certainly thought, ‘Hey, they’re out there to destroy the Asimovs and Heinleins of the world, and show the world of science fiction that there was a new sheriff in town.’ And I think they pretty much succeeded at that.” Warren Spector on Origin: “One of the most important lessons I learned from [Richard Garriott and Chris Roberts] when I first started working at Origin was the power of a clear, compelling vision. … They always have a vision, and they are uncompromising in the realization of that vision. … There was some magic to being part of Origin, and one of my minor regrets is—when I was working there, I think I was the 26th person hired by the company, and I really thought I was going to retire from Origin and get a gold watch and all that. And that’s just not the way this business works. … But it was a very special place, there’s no doubt. And the fact that it was a special place helped us create special games.” Warren Spector on dialogue: “It’s very easy for us to simulate the pulling of a virtual trigger, and it’s very, very hard for us to simulate a conversation. I defy anybody to show me a conversation system in a game today that isn’t identical to the conversation systems that Richard Garriott was using in the ’80s. The big innovation in conversation systems now is that there’s a timer on your choice on the branching tree. And I just don’t think that’s good enough. But again, if I knew how to solve that problem I would. I’m not disparaging everybody in the game business. What I am saying is, I wish we would spend a little bit less time on combat AI and a little bit more on non-combat AI—on creating characters you can bond with on an emotional level.” Warren Spector on game design: “I actually have a mission statement that I’ve carried with me for the last 15 years, from one studio to another, that’s all about player empowerment, and players telling their own story, and sharing authorship with players. I’ve got a 12-page version that no one would read, and an eight-page version that no one would read, and a four-page version that no one would read, and a two-page version that no one would read, and a one-page, and a paragraph. Finally I got so sick and tired of [no one reading it] that I boiled it down to two words: playstyle matters. How the player decides to interact with your game and your game world is the only thing that matters, and the world should notice and respond appropriately to that.”",0.0

"New Viacom CEO interested in acquiring a piece of Vice. Viacom’s new chief executive, Bob Bakish, is joining a conga line of big media companies weighing a plan to acquire an interest in Vice, the   news and pop culture destination that has been expanding around the globe, The Post has learned. Bakish wants to make his mark on the struggling media giant and is out to show his board that he has a vision for an independently run Viacom should current merger talks with CBS Corp. fall through, sources said. Viacom and CBS are both controlled by the Redstone family, which would like to bring the two firms back together. But Bakish is bending Shari Redstone’s ear about giving him time to see his vision to fruition, sources said. Should Viacom move forward on a plan to buy a piece of Vice, it would essentially be acquiring a firm that it once owned under former CEO Tom Freston. Freston is a financial backer of Vice. In June, Freston told CNBC that, “In 2006, [Viacom CEO Philippe] Dauman let a key piece of Vice go for $3 million. ” Vice is now worth roughly $4. 5 billion. “Furthermore, had Dauman kept that piece of Vice, they would have had a   platform in the digital world,” Freston told CNBC. “They’d have a home for the Nickelodeon graduates. ” To be sure, Viacom has a number of issues that would thwart such an investment in Shane Smith’s startup  —   not least its poor credit rating and lack of cash. Still, said one industry source: “Strategically, it would be the best thing in the world for Bakish to buy” into Vice. In another wrinkle for Viacom, CBS has also held initial talks about a Vice buy, The Post has learned. “CBS has had a number of meetings [on Vice],” a source said. “Viacom and CBS have both eyed it. Shane would love to take over MTV. ” Vice’s assets include a web and TV operation based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Separately, several sources told The Post that Disney does not appear to be moving forward on a plan to acquire any more than its current 23 percent stake in Vice. A Wall Street Journal story in August suggested Disney was highly likely to acquire the entire business and that may still be part of a   plan. But for now, sources confirm, there are, “no active conversations” on that front. Vice’s other backers include WPP and 21st Century Fox. Time Warner also discussed a possible swap of its HLN cable channel, but talks foundered over valuation. Time Warner’s HBO currently airs Vice documentaries and a daily news show.

"High Drama: Cannabis Biotech Firm Phylos Roils Small Growers. When Mowgli Holmes and his childhood friend Nishan Karassik founded Phylos Bioscience in 2014 they had one major goal: to provide more transparency in the cannabis industry. That “and science, truth, consistency—and better weed,” Holmes wrote me in an email back in 2017. They never could have guessed in 2014 that within a few years, they would be the subject of suspicion and outright contempt in some quarters of the tight-knit cannabis-growing world. But maybe they should have, because the transition from the illicit trade in marijuana to the mostly licit cannabis industry was never going to be without its complications and conflicts. Large science firms and Big Agriculture see an opportunity. Little cannabis sees a threat. One of the first services Phylos launched was a “plant sex test,” which saves pot growers time and money by determining the sex of a seedling within a week of germination. (Only female cannabis plants contain usable amounts of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids, so you want to cull the males ASAP.) The company also began a collaboration with Rob DeSalle, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History and professor at Columbia University, to sequence the DNA of as many cultivated varieties of cannabis (or cultivars) as possible to shed some light on the plant’s evolution. The results were published—on April 20, 2016, 4/20 naturally—in an open source forum called the Galaxy. A splashy visual representation of the genetic relationships between cannabis varieties, the Galaxy is also, in essence, a road map for breeders. At first, the Phylos Galaxy was a kind of community science project—anyone who sent in tiny piece of stem (swabbed with alcohol to remove any traces of THC) got their cultivars genetically sequenced for free. (A fee was added later.) But later in 2016, Phylos began offering a “plant genotype test,” which included a placement on the Galaxy as well as a full report on its relationship to other cultivars. Because the Galaxy is public, it allows any breeder, scientist, or curious pot consumer to see how their favorite cultivar fits into the big picture—and it also helps growers decide what to breed next. (The farther apart two plants are genetically, the more likely they are to yield a plant with higher vigor and more disease resistance.) Genotyping also offers a quick fact-check, allowing growers to know if they’re mislabeling cultivars—which, due to the clandestine nature of the black market, happens with some regularity. From the beginning, Phylos positioned itself as a “new kind of agriculture company,” one that mistrusted Monsanto and championed small-scale growers and breeders, the people responsible for the vast genetic diversity in the cannabis category. At last count, the Phylos Galaxy had 3,000 samples from 80 different countries, making it the largest database of cannabis genetics in the world. So when Holmes announced on April 16 via Instagram that Phylos would be launching its own breeding program in a facility west of Portland, it wasn’t all hearts and smiley faces. Many in the cannabis community were outraged. “How about staying in your lane,” said one early response. “Damn, maybe you really have been stealing genetics this entire time,” began another. And finally: “Every idiot that allowed your company to put their genetics into their system just lost all their intellectual property.” At first glance, the haters’ comments might’ve been dismissed as paranoia, jealousy, or at the very least anti-science. After all, you can’t resurrect a cannabis plant from a dead stem and 2,000 sites on the genome, which was all Phylos was sequencing. But a few days later, a video surfaced that showed Holmes pitching investors at the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference in Miami in February. In it, Holmes tells a roomful of would-be investors that Phylos has a huge lead as a cannabis breeder. “We’ve been collecting data and IP for four years. We have really huge barriers to entry protecting us,” and that “we have more trust in the cannabis industry than any other science company.” The real bombshell, though, was when Holmes introduced a few members of the Phylos advisory board, one of whom had worked for Syngenta for years, and another who was VP of technology acquisition at the merged Dow and DuPont. Holmes continued: “So, having these guys around is just critical for us, because we’re building a company that is ultimately going to be acquired by that universe.” To breeders and growers who had often heard Phylos employees publicly disparage Monsanto, affiliation with Syngenta and Dow/DuPont sounded like a deal with the devil. Also the idea that Phylos would use its storehouse of genetic data—in some cases freely donated by small growers—to pump up its market value and attract a major industry buyer sounded like an underhanded double-cross. It was too much for brothers Aaron and Nathan Howard, co-owners of Southern Oregon cannabis farm East Fork Cultivars, who had been working with Phylos on a high-CBD hemp breeding project since February as part of something called the Breeding Innovation Network. In late April, East Fork was still publicly defending Phylos—both on Instagram and in real life. The Howards knew the company was about to launch a breeding program—it wasn’t a secret—and although they had believed in the company’s integrity and commitment to helping small family-run cannabis farms like theirs, they were growing increasingly worried that they had been misled. “For so long, Phylos had been talking about being a different kind of agriculture company,” says East Fork CEO Mason Walker. “It would be one thing to be under crazy financial pressure and eventually have to sell under duress, but to actually have that as an intentional strategy? That really changed my mind.” East Fork left the Breeding Innovation Network in early May. The episode is emblematic of a larger trend unfolding in the still-nascent legal cannabis business: The science and technology of mainstream agriculture is about to revolutionize marijuana. But old-school, pre-legalization cannabis growers fear they’ll be snuffed out in the process. Though cannabis remains federally illegal, 11 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized recreational adult use, and 33 states along with DC have legalized medical use. Overall, members of the legal cannabis industry view the prospect of federal legalization—which some expect to happen in five to 10 years—with a mixture of hope and trepidation. Once cannabis is legal, Big Agriculture will be able to invest enormous sums into improving cannabis. Once that happens, it will become extremely difficult for longtime breeders and growers to compete. Other monied interests from Big Pharma and the alcohol beverage industries have already jumped in. (Look no further than liquor conglomerate Constellation Brands, which last year invested $4 billion in Canadian cannabis firm Canopy Growth.) The small players—the breeders and growers who have created the wide-ranging diversity that we see in dispensaries from California to Massachusetts—are barely hanging on as it is. Will they be crushed by the next wave of consolidation? Holmes, who was named after a character in The Jungle Book and grew up on a commune in the woods outside of Eugene, Oregon, seems more aware of this dynamic than anyone. A molecular biologist with a PhD from Columbia University, Holmes helped found the Open Cannabis Project in 2016 with the intention of protecting the genetic diversity of cannabis. In 2015, when the US Patent and Trade Office granted the first in a series of so-called utility patents on cannabis, he and colleague Jeremy Plumb realized that all the genomic data Phylos was collecting could protect growers and breeders by establishing “prior art”—evidence that your invention is already known or available. (Plumb, who was the first executive director of the Open Cannabis Project, is now director of production science at Portland-based cannabis grower Prūf Cultivar.) If you document prior art by putting genetic data in the public domain, it makes it harder for companies to get patents on those strains. The Open Cannabis Project would link to the raw genomic data, which Phylos would post—with customers’ consent—onto the National Center for Biotechnology Information, a public database at the National Institutes of Health. As former Open Cannabis Project board member Reggie Gaudino, president of Berkeley-based cannabis tech company Steep Hill, told me, “Having this database says ‘Look, this already existed, so you can’t have that patent, Monsanto!’” (In 2018, Bayer acquired Monsanto.) Soon, breeders and growers from around the world—who might have been hesitant at first to share the genetic data of their beloved, proprietary cultivars—were sending them in to Phylos, who sequenced the DNA using a system that could read 2,000 sites on the genome. Because cannabis does not grow “true to type,” planting the seeds from one OG Kush plant can result in enormous variety. And yet some breeders will call all the progeny “OG Kush.” When I spoke to Holmes in early March about his genomic testing company expanding into breeding, he was already aware that some were leery of Phylos. “There is justifiable paranoia. Small growers are fighting for their lives right now,” he told me over daiquiris at the Cuban bar on the ground floor of Phylos’ office building. “They have never seen an ag company that's been a good actor.” In states like Oregon, where recreational cannabis was legalized in 2015, a glut of cannabis flower is driving prices so low that farmers are going out of business. Phylos’ new breeding program—rather than competing against small-scale breeders and growers—would give them an economic leg up, according to Holmes. “We have to give breeders the tools and genetics they need to keep producing interesting stuff,” he said. If Phylos scientists can, for instance, breed cannabis strains that are resistant to botrytis (a form of mold that can ruin a crop) or powdery mildew, or are high yielding, or that have higher levels of lesser known (but medically promising) cannabinoids like CBG, CBC, or THCV, they could get those out to growers. Holmes promised these plants will be “widely available and very affordable,” and in many cases they will be sold with an open source license—meaning other breeders can continue to work with them. (The company has teamed up with indoor ag venture Crop One to form a new business called Conception Nurseries, which will sell cannabis clones.) Conception will also sell small-scale breeders’ starts, labeling them with the breeder’s name as well as the cultivar’s name, and will offer fair credit and royalties. But unfortunately for Holmes, these potential positives for small-scale growers were overshadowed by a creeping fear that Phylos would use genomic data for its own gain, and that it would adopt the tactics of despised Big Ag companies. Or maybe even become part of one. The Benzinga pitch video certainly didn’t help. In it, Holmes told investors that all the cannabis around today would soon be gone, replaced by optimized new varieties that Phylos would develop. In the wake of the video, a handful of growers (East Fork, Prūf Cultivars, and Willcox Pharm in Arizona) abandoned the Breeding Innovation Network, at least two Phylos advisers have quit, and the Open Cannabis Project has dissolved. In mid-May, when I asked Holmes if he was surprised by the intensity of the reaction to Phylos’ breeding program announcement, he paused before answering. “We were surprised. We were naive about it. We didn’t realize how threatening it would seem to people,” he said, speaking slowly, choosing his words with care. “We saw most of the cannabis industry as being composed of growers. And we thought they would be excited to have the new plants. I think we underestimated how much every grower sees themselves as a breeder as well.” Over the past 50 years, cannabis breeding has been an experimental, crowdsourced project. That’s not to say that breeders from Humboldt County to Holland aren’t developing proprietary strains—they are. “There are old-school cannabis breeders who are masters of what they do,” Holmes told me back in March. But because cannabis has largely been illegal the US, there haven’t been any large-scale directional breeding programs to help improve the plants for agronomic traits (resistance to pests and pathogens, increasing yield and vigor) as well as chemical components (novel terpenes and medicinally important cannabinoids). “We have never brought the full force of modern plant breeding to bear on cannabis,” Holmes added. The company had been morphing into a plant breeding concern for years, and “I don’t think we did enough to make sure people understood that,” Holmes said. The idea of launching a breeding program came when Phylos scientists found collaborating with other breeders was an inefficient way to find markers for powdery mildew or botryitis. “It was great working with those companies,"" he acknowledged, ""but it was painfully slow getting work done in other peoples’ facilities. It’s hard to get people to dedicate the scientific resources.” Though Phylos has been accused of using the genomic data that was obtained when growers sent samples into the Galaxy, Holmes asserted that is not enough to help drive Phylos’ breeding program. To do “marker-assisted breeding”—which is what Phylos is planning—you need to both have the “phenotype,” or plant characteristics, as well as the genotype. As Holmes explained, the sequencing the company did for the genotype test only looked at 2,000 sites on the genome, which is not enough. In addition, Phylos never collected any plant information. The need to get more complete data is actually what spurred the firm to launch a breeding program. But instead of celebrating this decision, growers and breeders felt betrayed. “It really angered people,” Holmes said. As for the allegation that Phylos now somehow “owns” the IP of cannabis breeders and growers, it doesn't. “That’s the part that we could never figure out why that didn’t ring louder in peoples’ ears: We knew that people were touchy about the data, so we made all of it public. We don’t have any more of it than the whole world does!’” Customers downloaded it and used it to do their own tests. Scientists around the world have worked with it. “We just did not have proprietary access to this data,” Holmes added. Phylos’ genotype test can be a valuable tool for cannabis growers and breeders. Because cannabis does not grow “true to type,” planting all the seeds from one OG Kush plant can result in enormous variety—with plants that have radically different genetics and also different chemical profiles than the mother. And yet some breeders will call all the progeny of OG Kush seeds “OG Kush.” This is one of the reasons why consumers have such a hard time finding consistency, even when they revisit the same strain again. Phylos’ DNA test tells growers where their strain exists in relationship to other strains, and that information allows them to breed smarter. Some breeders are working to stabilize the genetics of cultivars, creating commercially viable F1 hybrid seeds. (F1 hybrids are the first generation of offspring of distinctly different parental types; they are also largely uniform, meaning the seeds from the parents should produce plants with identical traits.) To do that, they need to develop two separate inbred lines, and then cross them, creating plants that are both hardy, disease-resistant, and identical. Either way the Galaxy is like a road map for breeders. Which brings us to the tempest over Holmes’ comment that he was positioning Phylos to be acquired by a Big Ag outfit. He maintained he was misunderstood. During his pitch to investors, Holmes said, he wasn’t talking about the beating heart of the small-farm cannabis world—craft cannabis flower, the stuff people smoke and use to enhance their brownie recipes. He was referring to so-called concentrates, the mass-market, cannabis-extracted oil that fills vape pens and that makes up not only topicals and most edibles, but also alternative delivery methods such as dabs, waxes, shatter, and live resin. “The part that was so shocking to people was I said ‘All of the cannabis today is gonna be replaced by new stuff.’” But, he pointed out, he was talking about plants used to make concentrates, not craft cannabis flower. Projections by BDS Analytics for the US cannabis industry say that the market will be 35.5 percent concentrates by 2022, up from 26 percent in 2018, and that the flower market will make up an increasingly smaller percentage of the overall industry. “The flower market is incredibly diverse and innovative. There are thousands of varieties. It’s absolutely not true that new varieties would end up wiping out the old stuff,” Holmes said. “We make this huge distinction at Phylos between the mass market and the flower market. And there is no preserving diversity for the mass market.” In other words, Holmes is committing the majority of Phylos resources toward breeding for the mass market, which will help the company afford the scientists and sophisticated equipment it takes to do all kinds of breeding work. ""This is expensive science, and if we’re going to succeed in doing it, we’d have to focus our resources on the mass market. We knew that the flower market would be a smaller percentage and that we wouldn’t be able to focus much of our resources on it. And we also knew that that’s an endangered world that needs protecting, and we realize it’s incredibly diverse and no individual varieties are going to dominate that world—or should be allowed to dominate that world. So we always kept it separate.” One of the rumors swirling around the cannabis industry is that Holmes and other Phylos employees told breeders that the company would never do plant breeding. Interestingly, the only person I could find who would go on the record about this allegation was Matt Riot, owner of Riot Seeds in Bakersfield, California. “I was really skeptical from the start,” Riot said of sending in samples to the Phylos Galaxy. Phylos knew this, according to Riot, and was courting him. “Every time they had private meetings with us—on the phone—they were trying to get me to send in stuff,” he said. About two years ago, during a phone conversation with senior business development manager Ben Adams, Riot said he asked, “Do you ever have plans to be a breeding company?” “And Adams said, ‘No no, of course not, we are strictly a testing company.’” Adams denies this. ""No, I never said that,"" he said. ""I think I said, 'At this time, we’re not doing a breeding program.’"" The backlash in the industry has been so fierce it can be easy to overlook Phylos’ supporters. One of these is Kevin Jodrey, the cultivation director and owner of Wonderland Nursery in Humboldt County, California. He has been breeding cannabis for over 35 years, and it bothers him that his fellow breeders—so long in the shadows—often don’t get credit for all their research and development. “Breeders are artists,” Jodrey said. “They are focused and devoted on the art, and a lot of times they get screwed.” When he first heard about the Galaxy, he sent in about 40 unique strains for genotyping. He did this, in part, to determine which dissimilar strains to breed with next. “Inbreeding allows you to ‘fix’ traits but—just like with the royals—you get some unbelievable superstar specimens but also a lot of really twisted ones,” Jodrey remarked. But the main reason he signed on with Phylos’ sequencing program was to show that his varieties were in existence prior to other companies coming in and patenting them. “If you’ve been in the weed business your whole life, your lack of trust is pretty well-developed,” Jodrey told me in March. “I trust the company. They’ve always been very up front about what they’re trying to do. I respect the scientists—they have one of the best staffs I’ve ever met.” He said he believes Phylos will work with old-school breeders and family-run cannabis farms, while the likes of Bayer won’t. “The people who are terrified of [Phylos] are going to have to deal with the guys who come next ... I see Phylos as a lifeboat to be able to move forward scientifically.” Even since the notorious pitch video surfaced, Jodrey has remained steadfast. “Everyone is losing their fucking minds! Have you ever done a pitch? If you tell your investors ‘No, I’m here to help people out,’ they don’t give you any money.” Jodrey reported he’s received countless emails and texts from growers and breeders begging him to renounce Phylos. “My relationship with the company isn’t as important as my relationship with the scientists in the company. I know they’re good people.” “If you’ve been in the weed business your whole life, your lack of trust is pretty well-developed.” —Kevin Jodrey, Wonderland Nursery Even the East Fork guys are hopeful that Phylos will regain the trust it has lost in some way. “We are pretty certain that they have nice licensing agreements and purchase contracts in place with a lot of genetics they brought in-house,” said Walker, the CEO, referring to the royalties that Phylos is paying to breeders. Until recently, this sort of arrangement did not exist in the cannabis industry; breeders have never received royalties for their work. Right now, most breeders do cloning in-house—that is, they take a cutting from the “mother” plant and grow it out. (Cannabis cultivars, like apple varieties, do not grow “true to type,” so the only reliable way to grow an exact replica of a plant you love is to clone it.) But growing clones is expensive—and takes up a lot of space. If you’re a breeder with a proprietary cultivar, you could give the mother plant to Conception Nurseries, which would quarantine it and give you clones of it on demand—which it says would cost less than keeping a “mother room” at your own grow operation. Traditionally there’s been an abiding communal spirit in the cannabis industry—what Reggie Gaudino at Steep Hill refers to as the kumbaya ethic. “You give cuttings to all your friends and then they put it in dispensaries,” he said. Should breeders choose to sell their proprietary strains via Conception Nurseries (and not just keep them in reserve for their own use), Phylos and Conception are devising a way to credit breeders for their long-term R&D—and pay them royalties. Phylos already has licensing agreements in place that give growers a lump sum up front for their germplasm; other agreements give growers a royalty every time one of their clones, which can be identified with their farm’s name on it, sells. Additionally, Phylos has formed a Small Farmers Network that entitles members to a 20 percent discount on all tests, as well as early access to scientific discoveries that come out of Phylos’ breeding work. (Membership to the Small Farmers Network is free.) Another Phylos initiative, the Breeding Innovation Network, is a collaboration with breeders who want to advance R&D. Any useful discoveries that come out of the network, for instance, will be shared across the network. (The raw data itself will not be shared within the group, but any products or best practices that come out of the data will.) “Because of the nature of illegality over the last 100 years, [cannabis research] is very decentralized,” said Phylos head plant breeder Brian Campbell. “When you work with corn, wheat, or rice, there are massive international repositories. You want some germplasm? You just make a request and they send them to you. That doesn’t exist with cannabis.” As wholesale prices for flower continue to plummet in several states that have legalized cannabis, Phylos hopes to help craft growers differentiate themselves by getting them strains that are loaded with interesting terpenes or that have high levels of cannabinoids such as CBG, CBC, and THCV, which (unlike THC) looks like it may be an appetite suppressant. Yes, these new strains will cost slightly more, but Holmes believes that discerning consumers will pay more for better quality product, just as they do for organic chicken or local microbrews. “We’re gonna make plants that have very high levels of limonene and pinene that make people alert and energetic,” Holmes said. “We’re going to make amazing, amazing new weed.” The Open Cannabis Project, which Holmes formed in part to protect the richness and diversity of the cannabis plant, folded in early May. On May 6, after digesting what she saw in the pitch video, Open Cannabis Project executive director Beth Schechter and her board decided to dissolve the organization. In a public statement she posted to Medium, Schechter wrote: “Through it all, and despite our best efforts, we’ve been called a fraud, a scam, and a cover for some kind of secret plot. At first, we thought it was simply a technical misunderstanding of the subject matter. Now we know that there is truth to some of these fears ... We sincerely believe in protecting small growers and breeders during this crucial transition to a legal market. We also feel we have been deceived.” Hence the decision to fold. Holmes said the Open Cannabis Project knew that Phylos was doing breeding work and that Schechter and others on the board were shocked that Phylos would work with people from Big Ag businesses. “Progressives see those companies as truly evil, and [Schechter] didn’t have a framework for understanding how we could possibly be working with them,” he added. “The idea that you could have one foot in both worlds and still be committed to being an ethical company—that’s impossible for many people to wrap their heads around. It’s too bad, because that stance is a decision to leave all of this scientific power in the hands of people you don’t trust."" When I spoke to Schechter at the end of May, she made it clear that the Open Cannabis Project had been struggling financially anyway and also had philosophical differences on its board about open source data versus patents. The Phylos situation, while not the only reason the project shuttered, was just the last straw. She sounded exhausted and relieved, but also more forgiving of Phylos than others in the cannabis community I’d spoken to. “Ultimately, their accountability and ability to make amends will be seen in the future,” she said. “I have faith in a lot of the people there. I really hope the top brass hears this, sees this, steers the ship a little bit back to the community-based, ethics-based origins that I truly believe were part of the origins of Phylos.” Schechter wanted everyone to know that Mowgli Holmes is not a bad person. “He’s a human who tried to do right by everyone, but he made a big mistake. He was trying to please everyone and that just does not work.” In the months and years to come, it will be telling to see if Phylos can deliver on all the promises it has made to small-scale breeders and growers. However, the clock is ticking. As soon as cannabis is federally legal, Big Ag will be free to enter the market, and much of the genetic diversity that Phylos has sought to preserve and nurture could be wiped out. If Holmes and his team can quickly deliver a steady income stream for struggling breeders and give growers the tools they need to protect crops from diseases, they just might regain their reputation as a good ag science company—and be able to impact the evolution of the cannabis industry.

"Scott Walker wants to let schools cut down on class time. That’s really risky..  Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker doesn’t seem to care how many hours schoolkids are in the classroom, as long as they can pass standardized tests  —   a proposal that could go against the academic consensus that time in the classroom matters.    In his recent budget proposal, Walker called for state lawmakers to get rid of the minimum requirement for how many hours students spend learning each year. That would make Wisconsin the first state without any guidelines for how long students must spend in the classroom. Typically, states require at least 180 school days, and Wisconsin law currently requires 1, 050 instructional hours for elementary school students at public and private voucher schools and at least 1, 137 for middle and high school students.  Walker says the requirement is an unnecessary regulation. Instead, the best way to measure school performance, he says, is through the annual report card put together by Wisconsin’s Department of Public Instruction, based largely on standardized test scores. ”For us, it’s about eliminating the mandate,” he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ”I want to give maximum flexibility to districts.”  “Flexibility” is a key word in this proposal. Ultimately, the move is part of a bigger Republican push to deregulate education  —   an agenda Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and President Donald Trump have both endorsed. Walker’s argument is that without school hour mandates, school districts will have more freedom to innovate or invest in virtual learning.    But there are a lot of unknowns with this proposal  —   and several strong counterarguments.     “There just isn’t enough evidence on things like blended and online learning yet that would inform schools how to use that flexibility to increase student learning,” Seth Gershenson, an education policy expert at American University, said, adding that there is a solid amount of research that shows students who spend more time in the classroom end up learning more, especially in math.  And for schools already struggling to keep doors open, this proposal would give administrators the option to cut hours, which could limit the success of   children.      Classroom time does matter             Classroom time is not a priority for Walker. ”To me, the report card is the ultimate measure. It’s not how many hours you are sitting in a chair,” the governor said during a school visit in Waukesha. In other words, he wants to focus on outcomes rather than input. But educational research has found that the number of hours in the classroom matters. “I think it’s a bit counterintuitive based on research we know on instructional time,” Julie Mead, an education policy professor at University of Wisconsin Madison, said. “In these budgetary times, those districts without the means could cut instructional time, which would exacerbate the differences between the haves and the  . ”  Wisconsin public schools have been dealing with massive state budget cuts for the greater part of Walker’s tenure, after he slashed $782 million from public education funding in 2012, hiking up teachers’ pension and health care costs. This latest budget proposal is an attempt to reverse course, calling for a record level of   funding, but nevertheless the policy change could put instructional hours on the chopping block for struggling schools.    Studies have overwhelmingly found that on average, students benefit from more time in the classroom  —   not less. At the Brookings Institution, Gershenson summarized some of the findings, based on surveys of kindergartners and school districts that experienced more snow days:  Students who experienced more school days between the fall and spring tests made significantly larger achievement gains than their peers who experienced fewer schools days between tests [. ..] An additional month of schooling would increase the average student’s achievement by 12 to 15 percent of a test score [standard deviation] which is similar in magnitude to the impacts of other potential education interventions.  In other words, the longer students spent learning, the more progress they made between the beginning and end of the year.  These findings are consistent with pilot programs in various states that saw longer instructional days actually helped improve academic achievement in struggling public schools. A 2011 study of charter schools in New York found that   charter schools required their students to spend significantly more time in class  —   including longer days and years  —   compared with more typical charter schools that didn’t get those results. A similar study in 2009 found that the longer school year was one of the key factors in   charter schools’ success. The    programs even caught the eye of former President Barack Obama, who, as the Washington Post noted, advocated for extending school time in 2009: Our children  —   listen to this  —   our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea  —   every year. That’s no way to prepare them for a 21st century economy. That’s why I’m calling for us   …     to rethink the school day to incorporate more time   —   whether during the summer or through   programs for children who need it. Wisconsin’s DPI agrees, according to WISN, an ABC News affiliate: “A spokesperson with the state Department of Public Instruction said the agency has no official position on the governor’s plan but said that overall, students need more access to learning, not less. ” Walker’s plan, though, would do the opposite.

"2 police officers killed, another wounded in Palm Springs.  PALM SPRINGS, Calif.  —   Two police officers were fatally shot and another wounded Saturday while trying to resolve a family dispute, Police Chief Bryan Reyes said. Reyes told reporters the officers were talking calmly to the man, trying to resolve things when he suddenly opened fire on them. The chief, his voice breaking, identified the fatally wounded officers as Jose Gilbert Vega and Lesley Zerebny. He did not disclose their rank or any other information about them. Reyes said the gunman was still at large and may still be in the home where the shooting occurred. Dozens of law enforcement officers converged on a normally quiet residential neighborhood after the shooting, sealing off several blocks and evacuating some residents, police said. Officers also issued a warning that people inside their homes should stay there, lock their doors and not answer them until further notice. Gerardo Barrera told The Desert Sun newspaper (http:  .  ) he was working nearby when he heard gunshots. “I saw a person on the ground,” he said. “Someone kept pumping her chest but she wasn’t moving. ” The shooting occurred just three days after a popular Los Angeles County sheriff’s sergeant was shot and killed in the high desert town of Lancaster. Sgt. Steve Owen was answering a burglary call when sheriff’s officials say he was shot and wounded by a man who then stood over him and shot him four more times. A paroled robber has been charged with murder. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. ",-0.5
"Guess which candidate’s foundation was caught in an illegal campaign funding scheme?.  For some time now, the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold has been looking into the neglected subject of Donald Trump’s charitable giving.    And most recently he’s found out that Trump’s charitable foundation made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (this reporting is based, in turn, in part on work done by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington). Then when they found out they had broken the law, they kinda sorta corrected the error but didn’t actually follow their legal obligation to get the money back. It’s all at least a little suspicious. The story includes the phrase: ”Trump staffers said that a series of unusual  —   and unrelated  —   errors by people working for Trump had led to both the improper donation and to the omission of that donation from the foundation’s tax filings.” What’s more, the contribution to Bondi came right when she was one of several attorneys general who were looking into possible Trump University fraud investigations. Shortly after receiving the illegal campaign contribution she dropped the investigation.    Oh, also, it turns out that the Trump Foundation itself was part of a setup to ensure that Trump’s own money was never used to finance a Trump charitable contribution. In the grand scheme of the 2016 campaign this seems like maybe not that big of a deal. But it’s hard not to notice the fact that various Clinton Foundation lacuna involving such scandalous activity as trying to help a Nobel Peace Prize winner, introducing the chair of the Kennedy Center at the Kennedy Center Honors dinner, and having a meeting with the Crown Prince of Bahrain have been major,   news stories. I think it’s fair to say that a lot more digital pixels have been spent exploring possible conflicts of interest involving Clinton charities than the contents of Clinton’s plan for combatting drug addiction.    Meanwhile, the various lies and fake donations that Fahrenthold has been investigating have gotten essentially zero bounce anywhere.  Donald Trump hates lies, but can’t tell the truth    ",-1.0
"Why ‘Wonder Woman’ is less American than ever. The   “Wonder Woman” has generated more buzz than any movie this year, and rightly so. She’s the most beloved and iconic female superhero ever, yet it’s taken decades  —   the film’s been in development since 1996  —   for a Wonder Woman movie. It’s the first to pair a female director with a     film meant to be a franchise. In Gal Gadot, it has a star who served in the Israeli army and brings authority to her fight scenes. “She is the ultimate symbol of strength,” Gadot  . “Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d grow up to be in a movie playing someone who influenced as many women as she has. ” What’s curious about this version, coddled and crafted over decades, is the   absence of America. Wonder Woman was born during World War II, created by American psychologist William Moulton Marston, and her debut on the cover of DC’s Sensation Comics in 1942 depicted her in red, white and blue, storming into battle. She’d left her home, Paradise Island, to fight the Nazis in “America, the last citadel of democracy and of equal rights for women!” This new Wonder Woman, however, has almost nothing to do with America. The film is set during World War I, in London. Steve Trevor, the pilot Wonder Woman rescues and falls for, is American in name only  —   here, he’s working for British intelligence. Most tellingly, Wonder Woman’s iconic costume has been leached of all color. The bald eagle on her chest, the white stars on her blue bottom, the    striped boots  —   all have disappeared. She’s no longer vibrant and strong; she’s sad, a pacifist whose armor resembles mourning attire. Wonder Woman’s global   appeal, it seems, depends on no longer being American.   last year, 70 percent of box office revenue is generated overseas, and those markets now take precedence, no matter how closely your superhero is identified with the United States. In 2010,   that his Captain America “would not be a flag waver . . . just a good person. ” Among the most important markets is Germany, which is responsible for nearly 30 percent of foreign revenue. Still sensitive about World War II and its Nazi past, German audiences brook little discomfort, and this new “Wonder Woman” is hardly the first to concede. “The Imitation Game,” the   2014 biopic of Alan Turing, the British genius who cracked Nazi codes, was swiftly rebranded. “We toned down the hero aspect and sold it as an emotional drama,” the head of marketing said. As for the film’s raison d’etre, “We toned down the whole World War II backdrop. ” Same with “Lone Survivor,” the 2013 film based on a   Navy SEAL’s escape from Taliban forces. “In Europe we toned down the patriotism and made it into a thinking man’s film,” said the head of Germany’s SquareOne Entertainment, which specializes in such  . “It was more nuanced than the US campaign. ” In his   Brad Pitt implied that his WWII drama “Allied” underwent similar repositioning last year, and the larger implications concerned him. “The European posters had the American flag in the background and it came back from the marketing department: ‘Remove the flag. It’s not a good sell here.’ I was like, Man, that’s America. That’s what we’ve done to our brand. ” Until now, the most iconic Wonder Woman has been the 1970s version played by Lynda Carter, her    costume the truest representation. Since 1941 there have been few variations, and those never lasted long. When DC Comics put Wonder Woman in leggings in 2010, ardent fan Gloria Steinem criticized the move, saying it compromised her feminine strength. “Jeans give us the idea that only pants can be powerful,” she said. “Tell that to Greek warriors and sumo wrestlers. ” By 2011, Wonder Woman was back to her usual look. Defenders of this latest cinematic costume may well point to the DC Comics films’ overall palette, the dark and despairing world of   director Zack Snyder. But to see Wonder Woman so remade, her look such a deliberate attempt to erase the country she’s long fought for, is to undercut what could have been the movie’s most substantial contribution: Why can’t Wonder Woman make America great again?",1.0
"A new video challenges the official story about what happened to Michael Brown in Ferguson.  A few seconds of video have reopened old wounds about police brutality in America.    Over the  weekend, documentary filmmaker Jason Pollock debuted his movie Stranger Fruit at SXSW, and with it previously unreleased surveillance footage of black teenager Michael Brown at a grocery store. The video shows Brown just hours before he was shot and killed by then —  Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014.  According to the filmmaker, the new video shows Brown walking into a store and exchanging marijuana with the clerk for cigarillos at about 1 am on August 9, 2014. But in the footage, Brown turns around and returns the cigarillos  —   presumably so the clerk can hold them until Brown comes back later. This footage was never released by police before. The video that was previously released by police, however, showed Brown at this exact same store around 11 hours later. But this time, Brown was shown   a clerk and getting away with a pack of cigarillos. Back in August 2014, police said the video proved Brown had robbed the store  —   which police and Wilson’s defenders used as evidence to argue that Wilson had reason to fear for his life when he shot and killed the teenager.    The new video complicates the story by suggesting that Brown showed up at the store not to rob it, but to pick up his cigarillos as part of an ongoing consensual  —   if illegal  —   exchange. So it’s not so much that Brown took part in a robbery, but that a     drug deal went wrong.    The video has not been authenticated by media outlets, nor have local police verified its legitimacy or what it shows. It’s possible that it was edited or otherwise doctored. But it’s already led to protests in the Ferguson area, according to CNN. Still, the newly released video casts new questions on the Brown shooting case: Why wasn’t this video previously released by police but the other video was? Why did it take a documentary to force it into the light a few years later? And does this really mean anything for the actual shooting of Brown, given that the standards for use of force are so narrow and Wilson was already cleared after a grand jury decided not to indict him?    In other words, nearly three years after Brown’s death, we are once again relitigating the shooting that elevated the massive Black Lives Matter movement over police brutality and the broader racial disparities in how cops use force. The new video adds another hole in the police story The new video raises two big questions about what happened hours before Brown was shot and killed. The first question: Did Brown really forcefully rob the store? The surveillance video that police originally released only seemed to show the end of Brown’s dealings with the store  —   particularly the moments where he pushed aside a staff member at the store who was trying to keep him from leaving. Police used that piece to make the case that Brown took part in a   robbery of the store just hours before the shooting. But the new video, again, suggests that Brown had a more consensual arrangement with the business.    The store, for its part, has denied that it was participating in an illegal drug deal. “There was no transaction. There was no understanding. No agreement. Those folks didn’t sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back,” Jay Kanzler, attorney for Ferguson Market & Liquor, said in a statement. The second question: How could this new video not be relevant if the old one was? St. Louis County Police have said that incident in the video “is still irrelevant to our investigation because our department investigated the encounter between Michael Brown and Darren Wilson”  —   suggesting that they were focused on the moments of the shooting itself, not what happened before. But if that’s the case, why was the old surveillance video of the alleged robbery released in the first place? How was that old video relevant to the shooting if this newly released video isn’t?  Pollock, the documentary filmmaker, said the selective withholding of the video evidence suggests an attempt at character assassination. “We had to do this so that people understand what really happened,” he told reporters. “Because people think all these ridiculous things about him  —   that he was a thug. And he was not a thug. He just graduated from high school in a place were there was only 62 percent graduation rate. That means he was a rock star, and he beat all the odds, and he was murdered eight days after his graduation. ” Again, the video still needs to be authenticated. But whatever comes of it, all of this contributes to greater distrust in the police story. The Ferguson Police Department and St. Louis County police investigators have been mired in distrust from the start, with many people refusing to believe the official story of what happened in the moments around when Brown was shot and killed. If more people come to believe that the police were trying to selectively withhold evidence to hurt Brown’s reputation, that will only further worsen distrust in the police over what, exactly, happened in August 2014. Still, the video doesn’t say much about whether Darren Wilson was legally justified in using force The video alone, however, doesn’t show that Wilson wasn’t legally justified when he shot and killed Brown. Under the law, what’s relevant is that Wilson reasonably perceived a threat to himself or others in the moments when he shot and killed Brown. Wilson claimed that after he stopped Brown, the teenager tried to reach for his firearm and later charged at him when he fired the fatal shots. It is these last few moments that would be truly relevant to the shooting: If Wilson thought Brown was trying to hurt him, that would be enough for Wilson to reasonably perceive a threat and use force.    Wilson also claimed that he believed Brown was a robbery suspect, based on a call he got moments before the shooting suggesting that Brown matched the description of a robbery suspect  —   which would bolster Wilson’s argument that he genuinely believed Brown posed a threat. But even the video might not be too relevant here, because Wilson wasn’t at the time aware of the newly or previously released footage. And, again, what matters is whether in the moment Wilson reasonably perceived a threat. A local grand jury, police, and the US Department of Justice have so far come down in Wilson’s favor. The physical evidence suggested Brown reached into Wilson’s car during their physical altercation and likely attempted to grab the officer’s gun. The most credible witnesses agreed that Brown moved toward Wilson before the officer fired his final shots. Although some credible witnesses suggested Brown raised his hands up before he died, witnesses who disputed major parts of Wilson’s side of the story were discredited by the physical evidence and when they changed their accounts. In the end, there simply wasn’t enough evidence, especially given the struggle at the car, that Wilson wasn’t justified in fearing for his life when he fired the shots that killed Brown. The video doesn’t change any of these details. So it’s likely not relevant to the criminal case against Wilson. Still, it may be ultimately relevant to the Brown family’s ongoing wrongful death lawsuit against Ferguson. Beyond Ferguson and the shooting of Brown, police have a big trust problem While it’s unclear if the newly released video will alter the legal battles around the Brown shooting, there’s little doubt that it will worsen a very real crisis in policing: distrust in law enforcement. Consider that even though Wilson was never indicted, the Justice Department found that the Ferguson Police Department was racially biased and used to generate budget revenue instead of protecting the public. Essentially, local officials asked police to raise as much revenue as possible through fines and court fees, and Ferguson police carried out those orders by targeting the city’s poorer, less politically powerful black residents. This led to often frivolous police work, exemplified by one of the Justice Department’s findings: Officers frequently arrest individuals under Section  (1) on facts that do not meet the provision’s elements. Section  (1) makes it unlawful to “[f]ail to comply with the lawful order or request of a police officer in the discharge of the officer’s official duties where such failure interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance of such duties. ” Many cases initiated under this provision begin with an officer ordering an individual to stop despite lacking objective indicia that the individual is engaged in wrongdoing. The order to stop is not a “lawful order” under those circumstances because the officer lacks reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.   …     Nonetheless, when individuals do not stop in those situations, FPD officers treat that conduct as a failure to comply with a lawful order, and make arrests.    More broadly, there are massive racial disparities in police use of force. A previous analysis of the available FBI data by Dara Lind for Vox found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: They accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete, since it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force.            One possible explanation for the racial disparities: Police tend to patrol   neighborhoods, which are disproportionately black. That means they’re going to be generally more likely to initiate a policing action, from traffic stops to more serious arrests, against a black person who lives in these areas. And all of these policing actions carry a chance, however small, of escalating into a violent confrontation. That’s not to say that higher crime rates in black communities explain the entire racial disparity in police shootings. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, “There is no relationship between   racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even   crime rates) meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to   crime rates. ” That suggests something else  —   such as, potentially, racial bias  —   is going on. At the same time, police are often missing when black communities need them most. Consider the clearance rate  —   the rate at which cases are solved  —   for murders and shootings in black communities. As David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, previously told Mother Jones, in minority communities, clearance rates for murders and nonfatal shootings can get “pathetically low. They can easily fall down to single digits. ” Journalist Jill Leovy captured the sentiment this fosters in her   book Ghettoside: “Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens. ” Together, all of this feeds into the idea that police overpolice black communities by stopping and shooting black men for petty crimes and simultaneously underpolice the same communities for more serious crimes that actually require police help. And that crisis of confidence is why police are wrangling with movements like Black Lives Matter that think how America does policing is fundamentally broken and needs to be fixed  —   and why we’re still debating what happened the day Michael Brown was shot and killed.

"Idealists can’t win.    Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality.         Back when I was 16 and an idealist, I decided that our church youth group  —   I was president  —   should sit and listen to Handel’s oratorio “Messiah” and have a spiritual experience, so I brought my LP and sat everyone down in a circle and talked about how wonderful it was and set the needle down on the vinyl.  They listened to the opening sinfonia and “Comfort ye, my people” and “Every valley shall be exalted,” but the bass recitative did not hold their interest, and whispers of conversation broke out and by “O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion” a   social hour had erupted, laughter even, and I glared at the violators but they were undeterred.  I sat and seethed as the beautiful spiritual experience leaked away. The contralto sang “He shall feed his flock like a shepherd,” and it was pearls before swine. People were jabbering about school and cars and hairstyles and what they expected to get for Christmas, all of them like sheep gone astray, and I hated them all and wanted to beat them bloody with a baseball bat.  Now I’m just a tired old liberal and I know very well that you cannot expect people to speak their lines like characters in a play you’ve imagined in your mind. Woodrow Wilson learned that at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, at the end of World War I. He sailed to Paris to create the League of Nations and bring the dawn of peace to a weary world, and all the nasty Europeans wanted was to crucify Germany and divvy up the Middle East. So Wilson made concessions to get his League, the U. S. Senate voted against joining the League, and the concessions laid the groundwork for numerous future wars including recent ones in the Middle East. And so it goes.  Idealists don’t do as well in politics as gamers do. Idealists are in a grim struggle to save mankind from itself, and gamers are just trying to capture your bishop with two pawns. A crafty old fox can beat the goddess of light two out of three times. But one out of three may be good enough.  I took my daughter to a college women’s basketball game on New Year’s Day, in a big arena packed with families, lots of little girls seeing how thrilling the game can be, the fast breaks, the snap pass, the   swisher from deep in the corner that brings Our Team, which minutes ago was down by 10, within one point of Their Team, though theirs is clearly superior, and the crowd jumps up and roars as time out is called and the tall, skinny women with ponytails trot to the sidelines, the band plays the Minnesota “Rouser,” and we’re all going crazy  —   this beautiful phenomenon is the result of somber dames in long, black dresses who agitated for equality in the face of general ridicule ages ago. None of these little girls are aware of that history, and there’s no reason they should be. The world has changed. Political correctness is easily derided, but civility marches forward.  Back in my idealist days, about two months after I almost committed criminal assault in defense of truth and beauty (“14 in Youth Group Beaten Bloody by Leader Unable to ‘Handel’ Their Indifference to ‘Messiah’ ”) the Anoka High School Tornadoes basketball team, widely expected to compete in the state tournament finals, played a   game against St. Francis, a tiny nondescript town of no distinction whatever out in the sticks somewhere, and our boys struggled against the gangly farm boys of St. Francis, and lost, in the closing seconds,   a defeat that, almost 59 years later, still sticks in my craw. This was not supposed to happen.  “There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,” said Shakespeare, and there is likewise a tide which, leading others to fortune, lands you on the rocky beach like a piece of damp garbage.  A year ago, in a restaurant in Minneapolis, the waiter brought over a note  —   “from another patron,” he said  —   and the note, unsigned, said, “I’m from St. Francis, and I was at that game, too. ” I saw a man in a brown raincoat leaving, and I wanted to chase him down the street and pound on him.

"How Exxon, under Rex Tillerson, won Iraqi oil fields and nearly lost Iraq.  When Ashti Hawrami, the oil minister from Iraq’s largely autonomous Kurdistan region, unfurled a map of untapped oil fields for a team of ExxonMobil officials in the spring of 2011, they saw possibility and profit.  The minister pointed to the blocks that had already been taken by other foreign firms as Iraqi Kurdistan, long at odds with the country’s central government over oil and territory, raced to establish itself as a player on world oil markets. He also showed them the fields that were still up for grabs. Tell me what you want, and we can start negotiating, Hawrami said, according to one former Exxon official who attended the meeting. It was the start of months of hurried talks blessed by ExxonMobil’s chief executive, Rex Tillerson, and other senior executives back in Dallas. The company was making a   gamble that new agreements would pay off handsomely if the northern region held billions of barrels of accessible oil. But the deal overseen by Tillerson, whose confirmation hearings to become secretary of state begin Wednesday, defied U. S. foreign policy aims, placing the company’s financial interests above the American goal of creating a stable, cohesive Iraq. U. S. diplomats had asked Exxon and other firms to wait, fearing that such deals would undermine their credibility with Iraqi authorities and worsen ethnic tensions that had led Iraq to the brink of civil war. A law governing nationwide oil investments was tied up in parliament, and Iraqi officials were rejecting the Kurdistan regional government’s authority to export oil or cut its own deals. When word of Exxon’s partnership with the Kurds reached Washington, the State Department chided the oil firm: “When Exxon has sought our advice about this, we asked them to wait for national legislation. We told them we thought that was the best course of action,”   Victoria Nuland   said.   Exxon’s 2011 exploration deal with the Kurdistan region provides a window into how Tillerson,   Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the State Department, has approached doing business in one of the world’s most risky, complicated places, where giant energy deals can have   political effects. The episode of   illustrates Exxon’s willingness to blaze its own course in pursuit of corporate interests, even when it threatens to collide with U. S. foreign policy. When Iraq’s central government threatened to throw Exxon out of much larger, established operations in the south, Tillerson personally intervened, using his executive clout to smooth things over with authorities in Baghdad while making clear his company would weather the political fallout in pursuit of its central goal: a profitable deal. “It’s a big company that looks for ways to make money like all big companies,” Philip H. Gordon, a former White House coordinator for Middle East policy, said of Exxon. He said the controversial Iraqi Kurdistan contracts reflected a natural corporate instinct to act in the interest of shareholders, not the U. S. government. If Tillerson is confirmed, “I would hope that he’d realize that he’s serving the interests of the country and not the interests of Exxon,” said Gordon, now a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Lawmakers will weigh Tillerson’s   track record at Exxon this week when they convene to consider his nomination to be the next U. S. foreign policy chief. The world’s largest oil firm, Exxon has long exercised formidable clout in countries where it does business. The company has not shied away from controversy, inking deals with autocratic governments and speaking out against sanctions, such as those the United States has imposed on Russia, that hurt its bottom line.      (Thomas   Washington Post)    [Trump’s pick for secretary of state may bring showdown with Republicans]  Exxon was one of the firms hungry to do business in Iraq, closed to outside investors for decades, after the ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003. By 2009, the Iraqi government had put its top fields on offer. While the terms of those deals were seen as stingy  —   paying $1. 50 to $2 a barrel  —   firms signed on anyway, betting that a foot in the door would lead to other,   opportunities. Exxon and its partner Shell snared the rights to West Qurna, a massive field in the country’s south. But Iraq, looking to retain tight control of precious resources after years of U. S. occupation, never offered the more advantageous deals. “Some said, ‘Let’s take this as an appetizer, not the main course,’ ” said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. “Then they were told, ‘No, this is the course.’ ” At their sprawling,   embassy in Baghdad, American diplomats heralded the new deals as a validation of U. S. ambitions to transform Iraq into a stable,   outpost in the Middle East. If it was an American company landing one of the country’s biggest fields, all the better. But Exxon officials were growing increasingly dismayed by early 2011 as they saw their narrow profit margin in southern Iraq all but disappear. To make matters worse, the Iraqi government was constantly in arrears. By the end of that year, it owed Exxon about $1 billion, according to a former Exxon official. Ali Khedery, who advised U. S. officials in Iraq before joining Exxon in 2011, argued that the Kurdistan region was one way to offset the disappointment in southern Iraq. Oil reserves in the northern region had not been explored, but its basins appeared to make it “one of the world’s most promising regions for the future [of] hydrocarbon discovery,” one paper said, with potentially as much as 55 billion untapped barrels. In its capital city of Irbil, the region’s government portrayed itself as a   alternative to Baghdad, where car bombs and militiamen continued to keep outside investors away. For Kurdish leaders, establishing the region in world oil markets was a crucial step toward the dream of eventual independence. Beginning in 2002, Kurdish leaders had welcomed small firms that were willing to brave an untested environment. By 2011, as Kurdish ties with neighbor Turkey improved, a   export pipeline looked more likely. But much about doing business in Iraqi Kurdistan remained laden with risk. Since 2003, Kurds had sparred with the   government in Baghdad over disputed areas and budget revenue. In the years leading up to Exxon’s deal, Kurdish peshmerga troops had come close to open conflict with the Iraqi army, forcing the United States to intervene. “This was part of a bigger game of political leverage that was going on since the overthrow of Saddam in 2003, taking advantage of a weak central government, an ambiguous constitution,” Denise Natali, an expert on northern Iraq at National Defense University in Washington, said of Kurdish attempts to expand influence through oil deals.  [Who is Rex Tillerson?]  But Khedery said the region remained attractive. “Despite it being far from perfect  —   the endemic corruption, the factionalism  —   the   assessment was that Kurdistan was going to be a much better operating environment than the Arab portion of the country,” he said.  In April 2011, after internal briefings about Iraq to senior Exxon officials, a team from Exxon and Shell met with Kurdish officials. Kurdish and company executives eventually settled on six fields that would be explored by the foreign firms. Afraid of losing out to other firms, Exxon raced to finish the talks. After Shell dropped out at the last minute, the company concluded the contract in October 2011. When news of the deal broke, some U. S. officials felt they were not given adequate notice by Exxon. Former company officials dispute that account. Either way, diplomats were worried the deal would disrupt parliamentary negotiations over the oil law and undercut their clout with Prime Minister Nouri   at a particularly sensitive time. For months, U. S. and Iraqi officials had been holding tense talks over a proposal to leave thousands of American troops beyond a departure deadline at the end of 2011. Only a few days after Exxon signed its deal, President Obama abruptly announced the talks had failed: All U. S. troops would be gone by year’s end, officially bringing the war to an end. In assessing the fallout from the Kurdistan deal, U. S. diplomats were worried Iraq would throw Exxon out of the south, where they had also signed on to a deal that would be important in helping Iraq increase production across its biggest fields. U. S. officials had long cautioned American firms against signing deals with Iraqi Kurdistan before the oil legislation was completed, but they stopped short of telling them they could not do them  —   they had no power, former officials said, to do so. “The U. S. government position with American and other firms seeking to engage in the north was to explain the complexities, warn of the unsettled nature of the laws applying to that, point out the complications in trying to get any oil discovered and produced out of Kurdistan, given the position of the Iraqi government,” said   James Jeffrey, who now acts as an adviser to Exxon. Adding to the friction, three of Exxon’s new blocks were in areas claimed by both Baghdad and Irbil, outside of the regional borders set before 2003. Despite the unresolved status of those areas, Kurdish officials argued that they, not the Iraqi government, controlled those plots. Exxon lawyers concluded contracts for those areas would be legal. When Hussein   who was Iraq’s oil minister at the time Exxon signed its deal for West Qurna, learned about the deal, he was irate. “The position of the Iraqi government was always to reject this, and the company was informed that this was a violation of Iraqi law,” Shahristani said. While Iraq sought to deal with foreign firms “with trust and good intentions,” he said, “this move by ExxonMobil shook our confidence in them. ”  [Tillerson reveals personal wealth of up to $400 million]  In securing the Exxon deal, Iraqi Kurdistan had wooed one of the largest U. S. companies and got it to lay claim to disputed areas, creating a foundation for greater independence and clearing a path for other companies, including Chevron, to follow. “People said, ‘This is a boomtown.’ You couldn’t talk rhyme or reason, they were so excited about it,” Natali said of companies’ view of their Kurdistan oil prospects. “They created a bubble that ignored history, domestic politics, geopolitics. ” Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, Irbil’s envoy to the United States, said that Kurdistan’s oil contracts “have put the Kurdistan region on the global energy map and have helped to internationalize our economy after years of enforced isolation. ” Officials in Baghdad saw Exxon’s decision to sign up for blocks such as Bashiqa, which lies entirely outside the current Kurdistan regional borders, as siding with Kurds in the land dispute. “When any company comes and works in those areas, it’s clear that it’s contributing in inflaming a conflict and pouring oil on the flames,” Shahristani said. Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company followed “all laws and regulations” in pursuing the Iraqi Kurdistan deal. “Issues involving management of hydrocarbon resources in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are for the Iraqi people to resolve,” he said. Shahristani, who by the fall of 2011 had become deputy prime minister for energy matters, advised Maliki to withdraw the Qurna contract and take Exxon to international arbitration. As Baghdad made threats, Exxon tried to convince Iraqi officials that greater production would benefit the country in the long run. In January 2013, Tillerson flew to Baghdad and met with Maliki himself. There, Tillerson told Maliki that Exxon was “prepared to stay and operate in both [parts of the country] and it was the Iraqi government’s choice,” said a former senior State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “He didn’t blink. In the end, he came away with that deal. ” By that point, the stakes in assessing a potential expulsion were already lower for Exxon, which had begun selling off parts of its unprofitable West Qurna interests. The Iraqi Oil Ministry, despite its threats, never brought legal action against Exxon, but it did seek to exclude Exxon from a later auction and push it out of the southern   project. “I think a big part of it was Tillerson,” the former official continued. “He personally went out and negotiated with all the individuals including Maliki and explained why it was in their interest to have the largest private oil company in the world operating in Iraq and the negative signals that would be sent if they would leave them out. ” Even after weathering the blowback from Baghdad, disappointing exploration results prompted Exxon to pull out of three of its six northern blocks in early 2016, walking away after spending over $500 million, according to the Iraq Oil Report. Like other firms, Exxon had found that Iraqi Kurdistan was not as good a deal as hoped. One official with a rival oil company, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a another major energy firm, said companies such as Exxon approach doing business in risky, politically unsettled places such as Iraq with a   perspective. “You may not like the administration in any particular country today, but in 10 years time there’s going to be a different government,” he said. In the end, he said, big firms “have to go to where the oil is and then manage the politics around that. ”  Mustafa Salim in Baghdad, Loveday Morris in London and Karen DeYoung and Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report.

"Attack on Ethereum Classic Highlights a Crypto Weakness. The promise of digital cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is that you don't need to trust the people to whom you send or receive money, because the software makes it technically impossible for anyone to cheat the system. Instead of relying on humans and their flawed judgment, you rely on the laws of mathematics. But a recent attack on the cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic—not to be confused with the original Ethereum project—shows once again how hard it is to remove human frailty from digital systems. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum Classic relies on a decentralized ledger known as a blockchain created and shared by the machines that process transactions on the network. This ledger ensures that no one can spend their virtual tokens twice. Unless, that is, someone could take over at least 51 percent of the machines in the network. That's what appears to have happened last weekend. ",0.0
"The Supreme Court Turns Trump's Travel Ban Into a Refugee Ban. President Donald Trump has called the Supreme Court's vote to partially lift the injunction on his executive order that bars travel from six predominantly Muslim countries  “a clear victory for our national security."" He celebrated that it will enable one of his most controversial policies yet to ""become largely effective."" There’s only one problem with that assessment: It does not, in fact, make the ban largely effective at all. In its decision, the court exempts from the ban any “foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” That, immigration experts say, includes the vast majority of people who were applying to come to the United States from those countries anyway, including family members, students, and employees of American businesses.

"Tulsa cop charged in shooting once bashed ex-beau’s car with a shovel. The female Tulsa cop   was a   teen who later had two protective orders taken out against her in alleged   cases, according to a job application.

Her ex took out the first protective order, while the second was obtained in 2000 by the new wife of one of the   Shelby’s  . Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in 2011 after serving four years with the sheriff’s office, maintained on the application that the new wife’s order was “an attempt to discredit my character” and that she had not done anything wrong.

"This fanged fish’s venom is like heroin. Fang blennies are tiny, tropical fish with huge, terrifying fangs  —   that shoot out a toxic,   venom. The timid fish’s venom is a surprisingly potent cocktail packed with properties that act like heroin or morphine, according to a new study  If a predator were to try and eat up one of the fish, they would experience a sudden dizziness, causing them to either spit out the fish, or making their jaws and gills relax so much that the little blenny could swim right out. The latest research discovered the fang blennies shoot out the venom from their massive bottom fangs, unlike most poisonous fish, which deliver toxins through their fins. And when the researchers injected lab mice with the venom, the mice experienced zero pain. Rather, their blood pressure plummeted by 40 percent. “For the fang blenny venom to be painless in mice was quite a surprise,” Bryan Fry, one of the study’s    “Fish with venomous dorsal spines produce immediate and blinding pain. ” Their venom, which includes opioid peptides and components found in the venom of cone snails and scorpions, is the only one of its kind to be discovered in nature. The unique makeup of the substance could potentially be used to develop new painkillers for humans. Further, the research team noted that the fish is probably the   venomous creature that evolved to use venom as a defense, rather than trying to catch itself food. In his statement, Fry added that the research team began the study on nothing more than “basic wonderment. ”",1.0
"Famed short-seller Tilson is bearish on Wingstop. Whitney Tilson’s latest short idea may take some of the flavor out of Sunday football gatherings. The   who famously brought down Lumber Liquidators’ stock 20 months ago by highlighting possible unsafe levels of formaldehyde in its laminate flooring has taken a bearish view on Wingstop, the   wings joint. Although conceding the   chain is a “decent company with reasonable growth prospects,” the hedgie argued on Tuesday that there is little unique about the business. The company faces stiff competition from Buffalo Wild Wings, KFC and Popeyes  —   as well as supermarkets peddling    wings, according to Tilson, who unveiled the short, his   ever, at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York. To be sure, Wingstop’s shares are up 34 percent this year, to Monday’s close at $31. 19  —   but that was barely above the June 2015 IPO price of $30. “Given that the stock is currently priced for perfection, if I’m wrong, it has little upside  —   and if I’m right, look out below!” Tilson said. Nearly   of Wingstop’s locations are in Texas and California, making business unproven elsewhere, Tilson said. Still, the company earlier this month reiterated its plan to operate 2, 500 stores by the end of 2018. Representatives for Wingstop were not immediately available to comment. Tilson also revisited some of the investment ideas he presented at previous Robin Hood conferences. He has pitched 12 ideas at Robin Hood  —   11 of which have worked in his favor with an average gain of 43 percent, he said. “Robin Hood is good mojo for any stock I mention, so I’m going to talk about a lot of stocks. ” Tilson said. Among Tilson’s previous picks are long positions on JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, as well as short positions on Wayfair, Lumber Liquidators and Exact Sciences  —   his largest short ever.",1.0
"Terminally ill 14-year-old fills final summer with friends, family and a ‘last dance’.             Jerika Bolen’s prom night was one many girls would wish for  —   a brimming ballroom bathed in green and black embellishments with a queen to match, wearing a glimmering greenish gown, a tiara and a sash. But for Jerika, it would be her last. Jerika, from Appleton, Wis. had Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a condition that destroys the nerves that control muscle movement. She knew her fate  —   the disease most often robs its victims of life by adolescence. So she planned a magical summer, one filled with family, friends and a celebration dubbed “J’s Last Dance,” according to a GoFundMe page set up for the teen. Then she planned to shut down the ventilator that was helping to keep her alive and slowly slip away from years of suffering. Two months after people crowded into a ballroom to show support and say goodbye, Jerika died Thursday at a hospice center in Appleton, her mother told the  . “My only words to anyone questioning this is that I love that girl with every cell in my being,” her mother, Jen Bolen, told the newspaper, “and no one in their right mind would let someone suffer like she was. ”   [‘I’m going to be free’: Terminally ill Wisconsin teen schedules her death and one ‘last dance’]   When Jerika was 8 months old, she started losing her strength and mobility; she could no longer crawl or hold up her small body, her mother told the  . Doctors diagnosed her with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy. The condition, according to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is “a genetic disease affecting the part of the nervous system that controls voluntary muscle movement. ” Most of the nerve cells that control muscles are located in the spinal cord, which accounts for the word spinal in the name of the disease. SMA is muscular because its primary effect is on muscles, which don’t receive signals from these nerve cells. Atrophy is the medical term for getting smaller, which is what generally happens to muscles when they’re not active. SMA involves the loss of nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord and is classified as a motor neuron disease. Muscle weakness in the respiratory system is the most common cause of death with the disease, according to the association. “When the respiratory muscles weaken, air doesn’t move into and out of the lungs very well, with subsequent adverse effects on general health,” it said. “Signs of weakening respiratory muscles are headaches, difficulty sleeping at night, excess sleepiness during the day, poor concentration, chest infections and, eventually, heart damage and respiratory failure. ” Jerika’s mother, a nurse, said that her daughter’s diagnosis broke her heart. “I refused to listen to that doctor tell me I was going to lose the best thing that ever happened to me,” Bolen wrote in June on a GoFundMe page for Jerika. “Despite the fact that Jerika never crawled, walked, rode a bike or did many other things most children can she was a very happy girl,” Bolen added. “Creativity allowed for our own way of fun and we enjoyed many wonderful moments together and I couldn’t begin to put words to the gift my girl has been to my life. ” The single mother tried to keep her daughter in school  —   first at Janet Berry Elementary School in Appleton, then at Valley New School, according to the  . Recently, Jerika finished her   studies online, according to the newspaper. At the same time, Jerika was plagued by a life that kept her in constant pain. The Washington Post’s Rachel Premack in July: Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA II) is a rare disease that causes debilitating pain and in her case the loss of all muscle control, save for parts of her face and hands. She has had surgeries to place rods in her back, remove all but a shard of her hip bones and fuse parts of her spine together with screws. The pain is regularly at a 7 on a 10 scale, which is akin to constantly having a migraine. Sometimes it climbs to 8, 9 or 10, because the screws in her bones pinch her nerves. People with SMA II, an inherited, incurable condition, don’t usually live into adolescence, but the people in Jerika’s life say she’s a fighter. “I just kept going,” she told The Washington Post. “I didn’t want to hurt my mom, I didn’t want to hurt my family. I wanted to keep fighting and keep fighting. I didn’t have a life. I was just laying on the couch, got up to do homework and then went back to bed because I was so sore. ” Eventually, Jerika said, she had to face her own reality  —   eventually, she would lose the ability to user her hands, to speak, to swallow and to breathe. “I sat myself down and I thought, ‘Jerika, am I here for me or am I here for my family? I can’t even do anything besides lie in bed because I’m so sore.’ ” The teen made a decision to let herself die. In June, with help from her counselor, Jerika told her mother she wanted to stop using life support. “I have been realizing I’m going to get to walk and not have this pain anymore and not have to, like, live this really crappy life,” she said. Like any mother, Bolen struggled with her daughter’s decision  —   not wanting to see her in pain, but not wanting to let her go. “There’s a part of me still holding onto that thread,” Bolen told the   at the time. “Is she absolutely sure?” “I promised my child when it got to be too much I would be behind her no matter what,” Bolen wrote on the GoFundMe page. “She has endured more in her 14 years of life than most adults will ever have to. I am beyond proud of her for fighting so hard for this long and I am honored to be her mother. “She has let me know now that she needs to be free of her broken body. ” But not everyone agreed with a young girl’s plan to end her life.    Jerika Bolen goes through the final stages of hair and makeup before her prom July 22, 2016, in Appleton, Wis. (Danny     via Associated Press)  The   reported:  Jerika’s hospice decision didn’t come without controversy. Those who’ve lived with the disease into adulthood were among the most vocal in expressing hope that Jerika would change her mind. A video plea from Jordan Schroeter, a Grafton man with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, went viral. “Please reconsider your decision,” he told her. “I know your pain and everything you’re talking about, but sweetheart, you have so much left to give. ” Adults with neuromuscular diseases engaged in a   campaign to the teen. Others were more direct in their attempts to intervene. Five disability rights groups reached out to child protection authorities and asked for an investigation into Jerika’s care.

"Trump attacks Clinton over email; she condemns his treatment of women.   DADE CITY, Fla.  —   Hillary Clinton and her allies on Tuesday intensified their attacks on Donald Trump’s character and temperament, as they sought to shift scrutiny away from news that the FBI had revived an investigation into her email practices at the State Department. As part of that effort, Clinton made her most direct appeal yet for women to reject Trump’s candidacy during a campaign stop in Dade City, where she recounted a litany of degrading remarks he made about women and referencing the allegations of unwanted sexual advances against him. Calling her Republican rival “someone who wants to bully us,” the Democratic presidential nominee was introduced at the rally by Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe whom Trump berated in the 1990s for gaining weight after she won the title. Machado  —   whom Trump again attacked after the first presidential debate  —   grew emotional while speaking about Trump’s disparaging remarks and said she fought disorders in the subsequent years.  Later, in Sanford, Fla. Clinton blasted the GOP nominee for failing to pay federal incomes taxes and assuring he lacks the temperament to control the nation’s nuclear arsenal.     Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a   Democratic president for the first time since the   century. View Graphic     Democrats are trying to win their third presidential election in a row and retain the White House after a   Democratic president for the first time since the   century.  Trump, meanwhile, rebuffed those efforts by attacking her over the emails during a rally Tuesday in Eau Claire, Wis. saying that her election would provoke an “unprecedented constitutional crisis. ” Trump said a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring work in Washington to an “unglorious halt” and called the email controversy the “biggest scandal since Watergate. ” “She is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a very   criminal trial,” Trump said.  The crowd at Trump’s rally erupted into chants of “Lock her up!” at several points through the speech.  News that the FBI is renewing its probe into the potential mishandling of classified material in Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state has roiled the closing days of the 201 presidential contest, and many public surveys show the race has tightened. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing into Clinton’s tenure at State has been discovered by the FBI or in several Republican congressional investigations.     Earlier in the day, during a campaign event in King of Prussia, Pa. Trump focused his remarks at the Affordable Care Act and again promised to repeal President Obama’s signature   law.  “When we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace,” Trump said. (There appears to be no necessity for a “special session” on Capitol Hill. The current Congress will reconvene soon after the election. And early next year, the new one will gavel in.)       At a rally in Eau Claire, Wis. Nov. 1, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said “the work of government would grind to an unbelievably inglorious halt” if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton became president. (The Washington Post)   But Trump shifted away from talking about health care in Wisconsin: “You know, somehow I think that Obamacare is not going to be her biggest problem. Does that make sense?” Trump quipped in Wisconsin. “She wants to blame everybody else for her mounting legal troubles, but really she doesn’t have anyone to blame but herself. ” Looking toward Election Day, the Clinton campaign is seeking to shore up support in several states where she had maintained comfortable margins so far.  While Clinton’s schedule in coming days is focused mainly to battleground states where polls have been close, the campaign announced Tuesday that she would be visiting Michigan later this week  —   an announcement which raised questions about her strength in a state she is largely expected to win. Democrats said Clinton is not overly concerned about the state but is trying to shore up support in the Detroit area as a precaution. (Clinton has been leading in recent polls by 7 percent there, according to the RealClearPolitics average and in 2012, President Obama pulled away in the closing week and won the state by nearly 10 percentage points.) The Clinton campaign deployed reinforcements throughout battleground states Tuesday, where Trump’s temperament and character remained at the center of their speeches. President Obama himself held an event on Clinton’s behalf on Tuesday  —   part of an     roster of   surrogates including Vice President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) and former president Bill Clinton. Obama took sharp aim at Trump’s temperament during his speech in Columbus, Ohio, calling into question whether Trump’s “erratic” behavior made him fit to be commander in chief.  Addressing men specifically, the president asked the crowd to consider the role that sexism may play in the election. “I want you to think about it because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy,” Obama said. He also said that Trump had shown no interest in working people before entering the presidential race.  “The notion that this guy is your champion, the notion that this guy is going to fight for working people, when his entire life he didn’t have time for anybody who wasn’t rich or a celebrity, who wouldn’t let you get into one of his hotels unless you were cleaning the room,” Obama said, “Come on. This guy is going to be your champion?”  Clinton spoke at length in Dade City about the allegations against Trump and said that he has revealed himself to have little respect for women by “demeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting” them. She said that Trump’s comments and the accusations have brought back “painful” memories of similar experiences for women across the country. “Look at what he does. He calls women ugly, disgusting, nasty, all the time. He calls women pigs, rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10,” Clinton told told the crowd. At one point, she detailed accusations from former beauty pageant contestants that Trump would walk into the dressing rooms to “inspect them. ”  “Now, as bad as that is, he didn’t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant, he’s also been accused of doing this at the Miss Teen USA pageant,” Clinton told the crowd. “We cannot hide from this. We’ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America!”  How Trump treats women became a heated campaign issue last month, when an    recording surfaced in which he made lewd comments and claims about women. Trump dismissed the recording, calling it “locker room talk. ” But since the tape surfaced, 12 women have come forward claiming the billionaire had made unwanted sexual advances upon them. Trump has repeatedly denied those charges, and he has raised the sexual exploits of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s efforts to protect his political future as a political  .  During an evening rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. a man carrying a sign sought to interrupt Hillary Clinton’s speech and began to shout, “Bill Clinton is a rapist!” Apparently in response, she offered an indictment of Trump and his supporters. “I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump,” Clinton said. “It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we are going forward into a brighter future. ” She added that the issue of how women are treated could have implications well beyond the election. “I want all the girls in America to know you are valuable, you should feel good about yourselves,” Clinton said. “Don’t let somebody like this bully tell you otherwise. And I want to say to all the young boys, show respect because that shows you are real man. ” The Clinton campaign released a new ad Tuesday featuring clips of Trump speaking about women in disparaging ways. Aides said the ad will air in eight targeted states, including Arizona, a heavily Republican state where Clinton is making a late play.  Her campaign also plans to begin airing its first television ads of the general election in Michigan and New Mexico and will return to the airwaves in Virginia and Colorado after a   hiatus, a campaign official said. Recent polls have shown Clinton leading in those states. All four states will see a   investment, according to a campaign official. Her campaign has raised a   $11. 3 million online in the last 72 hours, according to a campaign official, money that could prove crucial down the stretch.  “The Trump campaign claims their path to White House is through states like these but we’re going to make sure those doors remain shut,” said Jesse Ferguson, Clinton’s deputy national press secretary.   In a statement, Trump’s senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, characterized the Clinton’s new ad reservations as a defensive move. “It’s notable that in the final week of this campaign it is actually the Clinton campaign being put on defense and being forced to start advertising in   ‘blue states’ to hold off Mr. Trump’s surge in the polls, including two states the Clinton campaign boasted of having put away months ago,” Miller said.  The Trump campaign announced it was also investing $25 million in advertising across 12 states, including New Mexico and Michigan. But it did not say how much would go to each location. A Washington   News tracking poll conducted Thursday through Sunday showed Trump at 46 percent and Clinton 45 percent in a   contest. The poll finds little shift in Clinton’s overall support following news of the FBI’s renewed look at her emails, but strong enthusiasm among her supporters fell behind Trump in combined Saturday and Sunday interviews. Clinton still leads Trump by an average of four points in Colorado, five points in Virginia, seven points in New Mexico, and seven points in Michigan according to RealClearPolitics.      Speaking to reporters en route to Florida, a senior Clinton aide said that the campaign does not believe the renewed scrutiny by the FBI is hurting Clinton’s standing in the polls. “The race has tightened the way that we thought it would tighten but   …     we do not see anything that would suggest that the FBI story is impacting our support,” said the aide, who requested anonymity to speak more freely about campaign strategy. Asked why Clinton is spending so much time in Florida, the aide said: “It’s a state that we think we’ll win. It’s a state that Trump has to win.   …     Obviously we don’t think he has any path without Florida. ”   Wagner reported from Dade City, Fla.; DelReal reported from Washington.

And they didn’t even need IK Enemkpali this time. Smith will be seeking a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews on his torn ACL and Fitzpatrick will be seeking a second opinion from the men who decided to make him their $12 Million Man this season and this season only. And the way he should go about seeking it is continuing to play as pissed off as he was on Sunday that they stopped believing in him after he started throwing the football to the wrong team. The hell with Give ’em Hell, Harry. Give ’em Hell, Fitzy. Deflategate Tom Brady doesn’t have the pissed off patent, does he? Fitzpatrick won’t have Eric Decker with him this time, but he will have teammates who still believe in him enough to want to rally around him. “If pissed off is gonna stop the turnovers, then I’m more than happy to have him pissed off the whole time,” Todd Bowles said. “This is a   game. It’s nothing about belief or  .   …     If I don’t do my job or the GM doesn’t do his job or the quarterback doesn’t do his job and the team doesn’t do their job, eventually they’ll replace us all. It’s a   game. ” Show ’em, Fitz. Show ’em you won’t be the quarterback who has thrown 13   interceptions over your last seven games, dating back to the 2015   finale. Show ’em why you decided to bet on yourself with the   deal. Show ’em why Jets fans and the owner and the GM and the coaches should not be pissed off at you for a season of promise gone awry. “Woody’s put a lot of money, a lot of energy, a lot of time, a lot of resources into the team, so imagine how he feels that we’re now ” Brandon Marshall said. Pissed off. “Coaches, the same thing, the general managers, they work 20 hours a day, they barely see their family, always on the road, so think about how much energy they put into it,” Marshall said. “This is all part of the game where guys put so much into it, and we expect to be successful, and it doesn’t always happen that way. And when it doesn’t, you get these kind of reactions. But I don’t know how he’s feeling right now ’cause I’ve never been benched before. ” He’s feeling pissed off. “If this is the thing that helps us all better, then I’m for it,” Marshall said, and laughed. “Say whatever you want to say. We need to win games. I’ll take it however it comes at this point. ” Welcome to Fitzpatrick’s Last Stand, one last chance to right a sinking ship and steer it to playoff harbor for the first time in his journeyman career. It is his Last Stand until it is time to find out about Bryce Petty, but   with the winless Browns up next in Cleveland is not that time. “Whatever fuels the fire for a person to play and be competitive, that’s what it is,” Bowles said. “I know Fitz and I know what he means, and I have no problem with him venting his frustrations. Just use it as a positive. If that’s going to cause us to win more ball games and play pissed off, so be it. As a player, I was pissed off at my coaches sometimes. But that’s just part of being an athlete. ” Well then how about every Jet getting pissed off along with Fitzpatrick in that case? Fitzpatrick and the Jets rediscovered the feeling from the better part of 2015 against the Ravens when he managed the game and didn’t make any mistakes and leaned on Matt Forte and a defense that had drastically underachieved  . It needs to be the formula going forward. Jets fans who have given up on Fitzpatrick never imagined he would get hot enough to lead them to the brink of the playoffs a year ago before he imploded in Buffalo. Give him a chance as The Last Angry Man.",1.0
"The Alt-Right Will Fail. Even Under President Trump. A victory for Donald Trump is a victory for his supporters. Among them are voters who feel disenfranchised and overlooked, who fear their way of life is disappearing. But they also include a noisy minority of misogynist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic racists who made ubiquitous on social media during the campaign. This group, known as the alt-right, grew from an obscure white supremacist think tank. Now the candidate they embraced is about to become the most powerful politician in the world. Yet perhaps paradoxically, their future looks iffy. To alt-right leaders, Donald Trump is less messiah than a convenient, half-enlightened monkey wrench thrown into the political machine. ",0.0
"The creators of The Flintstones comic on bringing existential dread to Bedrock.  The most emotionally devastating comic book in recent memory features a man coming to grips with his obsolescence, questioning humanity’s squandering nature and gross consumerism, and coping with the scars of war.     His name is Fred Flintstone.  Created by writer Mark Russell and artist Steve Pugh, The Flintstones is obsessed with the human frailty that permeates the colorful, funny,    Time Bedrock that many of us grew up with. It uses Bedrock’s first family and  ’s   prehistoric vision to tell a basic truth about human nature: that a civilization’s first steps to survival involves someone else’s doom.  It’s all heavy stuff, and given the recent trend of cartoons and comic books going dark and grimy, the Flintstones’ existential crisis could easily be a gimmick in the hands of anyone but Russell and Pugh. The two imbue the comic with a stunning thoughtfulness and humanity that makes this melancholy swerve work for the modern Stone Age family. The Flintstones is a comic that aches and breathes, and that seeks to give us clarity about our own lives.  Pugh and Russell’s run is being released as a collected volume this week, and I recently got the chance to talk to the two about the creative process, the book’s rare glimmers of happiness, and how they determined that best approach to a cartoon known for its prehistoric puns was inescapable existentialism.    This interview has been edited for length and clarity.    Alex   Mark, I read in another interview about your intense dislike for Flintstones vitamins. Did you make this book so sad because you hated the Flintstones vitamins so much?  Mark Russell            No, I didn’t even really take into account when writing the book, believe it or not. I did have to take advantage of the opportunity of writing a Flintstones comic to make a jab at Flintstones vitamins, which you might have seen in issue 2, when Fred looks directly at the reader and he says, ”Vitamin pills are a scam.”    Alex   You said they tasted like batteries. Mark Russell I found it very gratifying to put that in Flintstones comics. Yeah, basically what you’re paying for is expensive urine. Alex   On a more serious note, one of the reoccurring themes of the comic is wanting to feel significant in a world where you’re terminally insignificant. How did you guys realize that was the theme that you wanted to go with the Flintstones? Mark Russell As a writer, I feel like I don’t choose what I’m going to write about so much as it chooses me. I write about the things that bother me, and one of the things that bothers me is how we’re continually dehumanized by the minutia and the pettiness of the world around us. So that’s something I didn’t really set out to make a comic about, but it’s something that sort of imbues the comic that I’m writing, because it’s something that weighs on me.    Steve Pugh Visually, it was kind of up to me to back Mark up in that approach. Probably the best visual representation of that is Fred himself. He’s a huge man, huge     guy, who 20 years earlier could take anything that the world threw at him. But now that world is moving on, his physical strength and his power is almost meaningless in the new situation in which he finds himself. Civilization is now sort of edging him to the side, because all the things that made him able to cope with the world are the things that are making him not part of it any more.            Mark Russell I think that one of the fundamental features of civilization is that it tends to reduce people to their economic functions, and that’s something I think is more clear with the animal appliances, that even their names are just what their function is in the house, like “Lamp” and “Coatrack” and “Bowling Ball. ” Those are the only names they know each other by, and it’s basically just because when you’re living in an interconnected societal economy, that’s how people tend to see you and what you therefore are usually reduced to  —   your economic function. Alex   Another theme of the book is the consequence of consumerism. At first, you’re like, ”Oh wow, this turtle’s so cute, because he’s holding ice cream,” and then after Fred and Wilma go to the mall and they start buying the power goat lawnmower, you start realizing these animals have emotions too, and they just kind of get tossed off.  Mark Russell I think that consumerism, basically what it is is a cute dystopia. I think that most dystopias you see in literature are gray and dark and usually very conformist. The United States, and I think in most industrial countries, we don’t recognize ourselves as dystopias because we’re colorful, we’re marketed to, things are bright and shiny. Our dystopia looks more like a Taco Bell than a concentration camp.  Alex   How is that reflected in The Flintstones’ art?  Steve Pugh It’s something I learned as I went through the book, how to pitch especially the animal appliances, how cartoony to make them and how realistic to make them in different circumstances, and enable them to be able to emote enough to empathize with them.  And as far as the human characters go, it was important that they sort of not realize what they’re doing to these animals. These are good people doing bad things to other living creatures, but they don’t get it yet. If somebody kind of took them aside and explained what they were doing, they’d be horrified. But because the society they’re working in doesn’t perceive these values, they’re completely oblivious to the chaos they’re causing.    Alex   That comes through in Issue #3, with the aliens Spring Breaking in Bedrock, this whole idea that the aliens are treating Bedrock’s civilians the way Bedrock’s finest treated the people who came before them.  Mark Russell I think it’s one of the themes of The Flintstones overall, that every civilization we see is built on somebody who was murdered or kicked out of the land they were occupying. There’s this uncomfortable family history to every country, every civilization on Earth. As we become more civilized we pride ourselves on being more ethical people, but the old things, like imperialism and conquest, take on different forms. They don’t really go away. Instead of actually militarily occupying the land and kicking out the occupants, we simply go there on spring break and trash the place.  Alex   Fred’s a war veteran in this series, and it seems everyone has their own sort of damage. Does that tie back to the concept of our “uncomfortable” family history?  Mark Russell I wanted to do something with the Water Buffaloes [the organization Fred and Barney belong to] but in the old 1960s cartoon, the Water Buffaloes were just sort of a gentleman’s club  —   you know, like the Rotary or the Lions  —   and it didn’t really feel very relevant to me. What did feel relevant was a lot of vets returning home from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and how we really haven’t created anything for them to come back to. So that to me felt like a much more relevant use of the Water Buffaloes than going back and sort of visiting this Mad   social club for gentlemen who just want to get away from the wives for a few hours.            Alex   In one of the issues, Fred and Barney’s friend  —   a Water Buffalo down on his luck  —   actually is excited at the idea of getting back to war again.  Mark Russell Yeah, again, it’s about them having been reduced to this role that they play, as opposed to being celebrated or given appreciation for just being the human beings that they are.    Steve Pugh Mark came up with the cool conceits way before I was brought on board, and when I read the script about the Water Buffaloes being veterans, it was one of those ideas that’s obvious once somebody’s thought of it. You see it on the page and you think, ”Of course, that’s beautiful, that’s perfect,” but it took Mark to think of it, and it works really, really well. It’s a little pin in the map that you can hang a lot of the other stuff around. Alex   Steve, when Mark tells you that he wants to take the Water Buffaloes in this direction, what’s your thought process? How do you tackle that idea? Steve Pugh Mark doesn’t put in a huge amount of visual data. He lets me kind of run with the ball. What I have to do is read the dialogue, read the characters, and then build things to support that. I call them gags. They’re not gags, but these set pieces. It’s implicit in the way these characters are relating to each other, so I can tell roughly the age and the demeanor and the body language of these characters just from what they’re saying, almost, and for the most part we’ve managed to stay in sync. I haven’t made too many errors, I hope, or he hasn’t mentioned if I have. Alex   I’m not a visual person, I can’t draw, so it’s hard for me to think about things spatially or know where to even start visually. But when you said “body language”  —    that clicked.  Steve Pugh Some artists really, really want everything on the page, almost like an Alan   description of the situation. I’m fine with that not being there. The main thing for me is I understand the motivation of the characters. If I know what they’re feeling about a situation, then everything else is fine. But sometimes you get a script where it’s not really obvious if the character’s happy or sad or indifferent about what’s happening to them, and then it’s a nightmare, because a lot of what I do is based on body language and facial expression. But it’s never a problem with Mark’s scripts. They always have the meat of the character in there. Mark Russell Sometimes I’ll send a script off and the artwork will come back different than what I envisioned, but it’s always better than what I had imagined, so I’ve learned to give Steve as little direction as possible and let him surprise me with what he comes up with.    Steve Pugh Great lesson. Write that down, Alex. Alex   The comic’s also deeply skeptical of nightly news and journalism. Where does that come from? Is that a dig at how we present stories over time?  Mark Russell It’s about trying to figure out what people are going to watch and give it to them, as opposed to actually thinking about stories  —   and you know, it’s a very human thing. We all do it. We’re more about getting the interest of other people than we are about thinking deeply about the actual problems.  The problem is that we’re always chasing other people’s approval. In a lot of ways in life we’re playing a game of Family Feud, where we’re trying to guess the most popular answers as opposed to the correct ones. That’s sort of the cardinal sin that Bedrock News makes, and where journalism goes wrong, is they’re trying to figure out what people want to hear as opposed to telling them actual facts or the truth about problems in Bedrock. Alex   The book also has a skeptical and perhaps grim view of religion and morality.  Mark Russell I don’t think it’s a grim view of religion. I think they’re just  —   it’s trial and error. They’re trying to figure out what people need from religion, and the bottom line is we all approach the universe incomplete and with different holes inside of us that need filling by spirituality. And so they’re going through a period of trial and error where they’re trying to figure out what’s going to serve people’s spiritual needs.  It doesn’t diminish the efforts to try to find something that people can latch onto that makes them feel connected to the universe, by virtue of them getting it wrong once in a while. It’s just that this is what happens. We get it wrong, and we’re trying to figure out what other people need. The problems that institutions have is trying to present an institutional solution to what is basically a personal need.            Steve Pugh There is also the aspect that you brought in of the two forces at play in Bedrock, where you’ve got the science guy and you’ve got the religion guy, and they’re both trying to win over the crowd. They’re both trying to find their way, and they’re both relatively honest about what they believe. The science guy doesn’t really know what’s going on, but he’s really trying to find out, and the religious guy, he’s really trying to find his way. You know, he wants people to be good. He wants people to care about each other.      There’s no intent to ridicule science or religion as bad things, but where they are in the story in Bedrock, in prehistoric times, they’re really out of their depth. They’re just finding their way on the start of their journeys. Alex   Maybe I’m leaning on the words grim and skeptical too much. But there’s definitely an idea in the book that you should be questioning what you’re presented. Mark Russell I think in the end what we’re saying is that everybody’s really just guessing. It doesn’t mean they’re bad people if they get it wrong, but they’re ultimately guessing. The fact that there’s an authority, whether it’s in the church or science or in politics, telling you something doesn’t absolve you of the duty of thinking for yourself. Alex   The book has often been described as melancholy, but in a lot of interviews I’ve read with you guys you always say something to the effect of, ”There are funny and joyful parts in it. ” So what is the most joyful part in The Flintstones? Mark Russell I think for me, I really like the friendship between Bowling Ball and Vacuum Cleaner.     Alex   That they both live in a dark closet?            Mark Russell Yeah, they’re basically domestic appliances that don’t have a lot to look forward to in life, but they find each other. They find great solace in their relationship, and I think that’s ultimately what we all do. Everything we have that’s worth having ultimately comes from other people. Steve Pugh I like Pebbles and   goofing around, but I do   …     Hmm. I know they’re in there, because I remember going, ”Oh, that’s nice.”  Mark Russell I think the relationship between Fred and Wilma is also very positive and genuinely loving, and is a good sort of humanizing part of the story. Alex   What about the gay couple, Adam and Steve? I feel like you guys were sitting on that one for a little bit, and in Fred and Wilma’s marriage issue it feels like you both got to say, ”Yes! We get to make this joke.” Steve Pugh There’s a little thing when they meet Fred in the street, I think one of them’s like ruffling his hair or something. I really enjoyed that. Yeah, you’re right, that was joyful. It was a really nice moment, you know, between friends who’ve known each other a long time, and genuine affection between people.             Alex   The flashback when you figure out what Adam and Steve mean to Fred is kind of a big deal, too. You think that it’s just the obvious joke, and then it goes a bit deeper and it pays off.     Steve Pugh That whole marriage issue was lovely. I mean, there were some terrible moments in it, but there were real nice people having nice things. Well, let me think, did nice things happen to them? I’m looking it up as I’m talking. Yeah, that was fun. That was joyful. I know it sounds weird, but you forget this [certain parts of the comic book] because this has been like a year between, a whole year for us. Why don’t we do director’s commentary for each issue? Alex   You should. Mark Russell I’m fine with that. Steve Pugh We can put it out as a series. Mark Russell Sitting in the dark, eating sandwiches while reading our comics. Steve Pugh Yeah, the guy who did the Battlestar Galactica TV series did that. He just sat on the sofa, watching his own TV show, drinking a glass of whiskey, talking about it. Sounded all right. Mark Russell That’s a good gig. Steve Pugh Sorry [for getting sidetracked]. Thanks for taking an interest in us. It means a lot. We were surprised how much people cared about our book, and it’s great.  Alex   Why are you surprised? It’s a great book. Steve Pugh Good books don’t always get attention. Alex   A lot of my friends who are into comic books, they always tell me, ”Oh man, you have to read The Flintstones.” And I’m like, ”I know. I’m reading The Flintstones, but it makes me really sad,” and they’re like, ”I know, I’m sad too.” Mark Russell It acknowledges the shared, sad humanity between you.     The Flintstones Vol. 1 will be available in comic book stores on March 22 and all bookstores on March 28. ",-1.0
"Obama’s final message sounded remarkably like his first.  President Obama walked off the stage Wednesday sounding remarkably like the political newcomer who burst onto the political scene 13 years ago. That Obama, a neophyte state senator from Illinois, was striking mostly for his faith in America’s institutions, its founding documents and its people.  “Hope in the face of difficulty,” he preached in a speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. “Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope . . . a belief that there are better days ahead. ” That was the message that Obama returned to again and again in his final news conference as president.  “I believe in this country,” he said. “I believe in the American people. ”   President Obama walks away at the end of his final press conference at the White House on Jan. 18. (Nicholas    Images)  Long before   Donald Trump’s surprising victory shook Washington, Obama was worrying about the threats to American democracy. In a series of speeches, starting with his State of the Union address last January, he spoke about the dangers of inequality, growing racial divisions, and how a dramatic decline in civility was hurting the country and weakening its democratic institutions. Those were some of the themes that dominated his farewell speech last week in Chicago.  “If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life,” Obama bluntly advised last week. Obama’s final news conference included a few of those downbeat notes. He took questions on many of the normal   issues that have defined the fourth quarter of his presidency: Russia, WikiLeaks, immigration, race, Cuba and his failed efforts to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians. He predicted that a move by Trump to deport “dreamers”  —   young undocumented immigrants who have spent most of their lives in the United States  —   would draw him back into the political scrum. But Obama’s final news conference was most memorable for his hopeful vision, which has endured multiple wars, many mass shootings and the unmistakable sense that the country has grown more polarized and angry on his watch. When the president was asked if he was worried about whether progress on LGBT rights would endure under Trump, Obama insisted that the biggest changes during his tenure were spurred by activists outside of government and, in many cases, far from Washington.  “The primary heroes . . . are all the individuals and activists and sons and daughters and couples who courageously said, ‘This is who I am, and I am proud of it,’” Obama said. “That opened people’s minds and opened their hearts and eventually the laws caught up. ” This was the kind of activism that Obama had long defined as uniquely American and cited as evidence of the country’s exceptional nature.  [How Obama has used his presidency to redefine American exceptionalism]  Later he was asked how he had explained the “meaning” of Trump’s victory to his daughters. The president took the opportunity to brag about this children.  “Man, my daughters are something,” he boasted. Then he bragged about the country he has led. In his very first news conference as president in 2009, Obama described himself as “the eternal optimist. ”  “I think over time, people respond to civility and rational argument,” he said. “I think that’s what . . . people around America are looking for. ”  In his final news conference, Obama chose to ignore the ample body of evidence that he may have been mistaken.  Instead, he returned to his core progressive belief that determined activism would inexorably produce a less divided and more just country.  “If we work hard and if we are true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, the world gets a little better each time,” he said.  That was Obama’s final message. “That’s what this presidency has tried to be about,” he said.   ",-0.5
"Netflix’s Making a Murderer: why everybody missed the point of the true crime doc.  In nearly every interview they’ve given since the launch of their Netflix true crime sensation Making a Murderer, directors Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi have struck the same note.    They didn’t go into the project seeking to exonerate Steven Avery, they say. They have no opinion as to whether or not he killed Teresa Halbach, they say. Their aim is to highlight problems with the US legal system that should give pause even to those who come away from the   documentary believing Avery really did commit the crime for which he is currently imprisoned, they say. The question is not one of guilt or innocence  —   it’s one of prosecutor misconduct and horrible mistreatment of the accused, they say.   Related Netflix’s Making a Murderer: the case of Steven Avery, explained  You can believe or not believe Demos and Ricciardi as you will. (I think they perhaps protest too much, as this New Yorker piece about the documentary, written by Kathryn Schultz, would suggest.) But what’s inescapable is that all the stuff they wanted to talk about really is in the film. It’s right there, for viewers to latch onto. So why has it been largely ignored in favor of the latest examination of ”did he or didn’t he commit the crime?” The answer is simple: because of how the material was presented. How the response to The Jinx differed from the response to Making a Murderer              The easiest way to think about the collective response to Making a Murderer is to look back at another true crime documentary sensation released in 2015: HBO’s The Jinx.    That project, too, faced criticism that it was too    of its subject, accused murderer Robert Durst (or rather, it did until footage from the project appeared to show Durst confessing to those murders). That project, too, provoked a massive discussion of how true crime documentaries work. And that project, too, caused frequent debates over the fairness of the criminal justice system. It even spurred its own   controversy, about what director Andrew Jarecki knew about the explosive ”confession” footage and when.    Yet few viewers left The Jinx unaware of any of the above. Jarecki didn’t have to spend interview after interview speaking to his true intent, and it’s not as if he packed The Jinx with lots of moments where, say, interview subjects patiently explained that Durst’s status as a very rich man meant he could afford better legal representation. He trusted the audience to be able to keep up  —   just as Demos and Ricciardi apparently did. Some of the reason for this is that Jarecki is just a better, more experienced filmmaker than Demos and Ricciardi. He’d almost have to be; he’s made more films than they have. He also had a larger budget, which shows. The Jinx is filled with artfully staged reenactments and beautifully lit interview scenes. Making a Murderer is mostly composed of flatly shot courtroom footage. That it’s so compelling in spite of its lack of visual depth is a testament to Demos and Ricciardi’s skill in and of itself.    The major difference between the two projects is this: The Jinx was presented on a    basis; Making a Murderer was presented in one big gulp. The former allowed for plenty of time between episodes to tease out the themes Jarecki and company were pursuing. The latter hung its material on the framework that was most immediately compelling: the question of Avery’s guilt or innocence. How   flattens TV shows to one or two major elements             The effect that   can have on viewers’ response to a TV show is something I first noticed back during the second season of Showtime’s Homeland. When it aired, the season was roundly derided for its ludicrous plot twists and bizarre emotional logic, with viewers laughing over, say, a pacemaker being hacked via the internet. What had happened to the sinuous espionage series of season one? Yet I found that viewers who watched Homeland’s second season on DVD or on demand had an almost uniformly different experience. In that format, the weird, gonzo plot twists that caused so many weekly viewers to throw up their hands in frustration were reduced from a series of jarring potholes to a bunch of minor bumps in the road.    When watching the season all at once, it was much easier to key into the season’s biggest swings and broadest strokes. Who cared if some of the smaller moments didn’t entirely work? For binge viewers, the big picture was still a success. I’ve observed this phenomenon time and again, with numerous shows: Viewers’ response to a series as it airs week to week is vastly different (and more critical) from the one it receives when it makes its way to DVD or streaming.   simply put, wears down our critical faculties. It tends to reduce a series to its most obvious elements, setting aside the considerations of theme or meaning in favor of the most   plot and character stuff. It, in other words, flattens a show. This is not to say you can’t perform a critical assessment after a    —   if it did, it would mean I was lying every time I reviewed a TV show after bingeing it. But it does mean that the binge can cause the onset of a sort of vegetative state, where the next episode is always there to welcome you after the previous one ends, and it’s all the easier to just keep going. As I argued in 2015, Netflix itself is inventing a new sort of art form, where the length of the story being told is novel, yes, but so is the way in which it’s assumed you’ll consume it  —   all at once, in a big pile. This reduces each episode to just another unit, mostly there to mark a natural stopping point rather than anything else. And, indeed, as Netflix’s Ted Sarandos told me when I interviewed him for that piece, the streaming service increasingly thinks of its seasons as big, long episodes, a marked change from how TV has traditionally been produced. How this all affected Making a Murderer              All of this brings us back to Making a Murderer, which wanted to be about one thing but ended up, in the minds of its many fans (as well as many members of the media) mostly being about whether Avery deserves to be in prison.    The numerous other themes that Demos and Ricciardi have talked about  —   the criticism of media coverage of Avery’s case and trial, the examination of prosecution tactics to influence juries, the deep dive into   prejudices, the consideration of class in the American judicial system  —   are all present in the documentary. But they’re much easier to miss (or ignore) when you watch all 10 episodes in a weekend (or less). If Making a Murderer had been released on a weekly basis, with the discussion proceeding more slowly than it did under the Netflix model, it would have been easier to tease out all these things in the conversations that sprung up around the show. When consumed all at once over the holiday break, it necessarily became all about Avery and whether he committed the crime. The   demands resolution, requires getting to an endpoint. Thus, in cases where the story doesn’t have an endpoint, viewers are left to seek answers on their own. My guess is that Demos and Ricciardi concluded Making a Murderer on a point of irresolution both because releasing their film was the best way to reopen Avery’s trial (by spurring public demands to do so) and because irresolution would hopefully make us think about what we’d just watched and about what Avery had to endure in the legal system. Instead, it just made us debate one question endlessly, over and over. I don’t want to exonerate Demos and Ricciardi entirely. They did choose this particular person as their subject, and they did create a movie that neatly elides a few of the more unsavory aspects of Avery’s past. It’s not hard to watch Making a Murderer and believe they had made up their minds about Avery’s innocence long before they turned on their cameras. The way they created the film may ultimately end up backfiring on them, particularly as news outlets dig into Avery’s crimes more and more deeply. However, I can’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy every time they walk into another interview (or take to Twitter) and repeat the same talking points they’ve been repeating since Making a Murderer became such a hot topic. While it’s possible their statements are just a sign of lousy PR management  —   rote responses from which they never deviate  —   I suspect their answers are more indicative of bewilderment and frustration that their creation has been so thoroughly taken from them and turned into something else.

HARTFORD, Conn.  —   Hillary Clinton accused gunmakers and the gun lobby on Thursday of using their money and power to coerce members of Congress to do their bidding, as she promised to work for new   measures if elected president. ”We need a national movement,” Clinton said at a community meeting in a YMCA here, drawing applause. ”The gun lobby is the most powerful lobby in Washington,” more so than Wall Street, big Pharma and more, she said, adding, ”They have figured out how to really intimidate elected officials at all levels, who basically stop thinking about this problem because they are too scared of the NRA,” the National Rifle Association. Clinton cited the massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren four years ago as only one example of a gun culture gone too far. She tied some gun violence to difficulty getting mental health treatment for some who need it, and said   activists are too often targeted for online harassment. ”There has been a concerted effort to undermine the   experiences of people who speak out,” Clinton said. ”Blame the victim, blame the victim’s mother  blame the victim’s family, blame the victim’s neighborhood,” she said. ”Find somebody to blame instead of saying  —   you know what, we’ve just got too many guns in this country.” She repeatedly promised to try to build on the Brady bill, which was passed during her husband’s administration, and said the gun lobby has effectively blocked most   efforts since then. She said   gun control can be achieved without infringing on the Second Amendment and with the support of gun owners. ”I am not here to make promises I can’t keep,” she said. ”I’m looking for ways we can save lives. It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun.”      Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says Americans cannot become ”indifferent” to daily gun violence in the United States, and that lasting solutions are needed to address the problem. (Reuters)   Clinton was introduced by Erica Smegielski, whose mother, Dawn Hochsprung, was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School and was killed along with 20 children and five other staff members at the Newtown, Conn. school by a gunman in 2012. Clinton’s voice broke as she recounted how a participant in a panel discussion at the YMCA, Nelba   had given her the children’s book that she and her    daughter, Ana Grace, had been reading the night before she was killed at Sandy Hook. It was one of the country’s worst mass shootings. An emotional Clinton said   asked her to read the book to her own granddaughter, Charlotte. She was also visibly moved by the story told by an audience member, a local pastor, of beseeching God to save his son, fatally shot at 20 by another   . ”Let the congregation say, Amen,” Clinton said when he finished. She mentioned her Democratic presidential primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, only in passing. She noted that he had voted in favor of a law giving gunmakers unusual protection from lawsuits, while she had opposed it as a U. S. senator representing New York. She pledged to try to overturn that protection.",-0.5
"Uber bid for dominance cost it $1.2B in six months. Uber has a long way to go before reaching profitability. The   app lost at least $1. 2 billion in the first half of this year as it grappled with competition from the likes of Lyft and China’s Didi Chuxing,  . Uber, led by CEO Travis Kalanick, is a private company but still provides investors with financial updates every three months. On Friday, the company’s finance chief, Gautam Gupta, told investors on a call that losses mounted in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg. Uber’s pretax operating losses reached $520 million in the first quarter, and topped $750 million in the second quarter, according to the report. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment to Bloomberg. The $1. 2 billion in losses adds to a string since Uber started seven years ago. Despite huge revenue growth, the dominant   service has managed to lose a whopping $4 billion before it even goes public. At that rate, Uber might hold the record for the biggest losses for a private technology concern. Still, Uber has about $8 billion in the bank and more than $3 billion available through a loan and a line of credit. Gupta blamed subsidies for Uber’s drivers for a majority of the company’s losses, according to Bloomberg. The San   company waged a costly war with Didi before deciding to cut its losses. In July, Didi gave Uber a 17. 5 percent stake in its business and a $1 billion investment in exchange for Uber’s withdrawal from China. Uber is also battling Lyft in the US, sparking a price war that has led both companies to spend heavily. Uber told investors on Friday that it’s willing to spend to maintain its market share in the US, Bloomberg reported. The New York market, in particular, is becoming intensely crowded and competitive for   services. Juno jumped into the fray on Wednesday, joining Uber, Lyft and Via.",1.0
"Trump nominates two prominent GOP women: DeVos as education secretary, Haley as U.N. ambassador.    Donald Trump on Wednesday selected two prominent Republican women for   positions, adding diversity to an inner circle that was already coming under fire for being composed mostly of white men. In a potentially controversial choice, Trump intends to nominate billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos for education secretary, turning to a conservative activist who has forcefully pushed for private school voucher programs. Her nomination is expected to face strong opposition from public school advocates, who oppose her efforts to funnel taxpayer dollars from public to private and religious schools.  “Betsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,” Trump said in a statement. “Under her leadership we will reform the U. S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver   education and school choice to all families. ” Hours earlier, Trump had announced that he will fill the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations slot with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a rising Republican star and daughter of Indian immigrants who has virtually no foreign policy experience.     Gov. Nikki Haley ( . C.) was nominated to be   Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. Here’s what you need to know about the rising Republican star. (Jenny   Washington Post)   Haley’s nomination marked Trump’s first female appointment to a   post after his initial selections, such as attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions and incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn, had been older white men. Though Trump was elected with strong support from white   voters, people familiar with the  ’s thinking said he wanted to announce both women’s appointments before Thanksgiving to show that his Cabinet will be diverse. The decision to nominate DeVos, who met with Trump last weekend, was made in the past 48 hours, the people said. They added that DeVos benefited from strong support in the conservative movement and among conservative political donors. But DeVos immediately drew scathing opposition from the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union. “By nominating Betsy DeVos, the Trump administration has demonstrated just how out of touch it is with what works best for students, parents, educators and communities,’’ NEA President Lily Eskelsen García said in a statement. “She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize,   and impose   solutions to public education. ’’ DeVos tweeted that she is “honored to work with the   on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable. ” DeVos  —   whose husband, Dick DeVos Jr. is an heir to the Amway   fortune  —   is a Michigan power broker and major donor to conservative causes and candidates around the country. Her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, one of the most profitable private security contractors during the Iraq War. DeVos and her family supported Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) in the GOP presidential primaries, and she was never an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. “I still have reservations about him as a person,” she told The Washington Post in July at the Republican National Convention, which she attended as a Michigan delegate.       Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet View Graphic     Here are the people whose names have been floated for Trump’s Cabinet  She has been closer to Vice   Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana pushed to expand that state’s voucher program into the nation’s largest. She also has close ties to many Republicans in Washington, and her nomination was greeted with enthusiasm by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) chairman of the Senate education committee and frequent critic of what he viewed as the Obama administration’s federal overreach on education, called her “an excellent choice. ” But others said her nomination heralded an intent by the Trump administration to dismantle the nation’s public schools by draining them of students and resources. “Betsy DeVos is everything Donald Trump said is wrong in America: an   heiress who uses her money to game the system and push a   agenda that is opposed by the majority of voters,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.  The Rev. Barry W. Lynn  —   executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an organization that has long raised concerns about funneling tax dollars to religious schools  —   called her nomination “an insult to public education. ”  Haley, also a former Trump critic, is generally considered a mainstream Republican, with views on military and national security matters that fall within the GOP’s hawkish mainstream.  “Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country,” Trump said in a statement. “She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage. ” Haley, who has accepted the offer, said she is “honored that the   has asked me to join his team and serve the country we love. ’’ Her words represented a sharp departure from the campaign, during which she also initially backed Rubio for the GOP nomination and lambasted Trump as “everything a governor doesn’t want in a president. ”   Trump is considering another prominent former rival and mainstream Republican, 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, for secretary of state, though some Trump advisers are reportedly pushing back against that and backing other candidates, such as former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Haley’s selection, also seen as an effort to reach out to establishment Republicans unsettled by Trump’s surprise victory, came amid indications that he was slowing down transition planning to spend Thanksgiving with his family. The   flew Tuesday night to    his private club in Palm Beach, where he will spend the holiday and weekend. Trump aides declined to provide details of his schedule over the next few days, saying in a conference call that Trump’s family prefers keeping the holiday private. The aides said Trump planned to announce another   nominee later Wednesday but would not elaborate. One possibility is another former Trump rival, Ben Carson, who could be named secretary of housing and urban development. Carson tweeted Wednesday that “an announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again,’’ though he declined to be more specific. Trump had tweeted Tuesday that he is “seriously considering” Carson for the HUD post.   Carson, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination before backing him, told Fox News: “It certainly is something that has been a   interest of mine, and I’ll be thinking and praying about it seriously over the holiday. ” Haley, 44, who is serving her second term as governor, has worked on trade and labor issues and traveled abroad as governor, including to Europe. She is considered a novice in international affairs, but her home state senator, Lindsey O. Graham ( . C.) appeared to be trying to buck up her foreign policy bona fides in a statement praising Haley on Wednesday. “As Governor of South Carolina she has recruited and dealt with some of the largest international business firms in the world. Her husband was a member of the South Carolina National Guard who served a tour of duty in Afghanistan,” Graham said. “Governor Haley and her family fully understand what is at stake in the war against radical Islam. I know she will be a valuable ally to   Trump. ” Haley, who met with Trump Thursday at Manhattan’s Trump Tower, grew up in a small South Carolina town and was elected governor in 2010 as a tea party reformer. But she has since been viewed as part of the GOP establishment. Haley is championed by party officials as a bright young leader  —   and she has called herself one of the those fit for a “Benetton commercial. ” Yet she rarely if ever challenges the deeply conservative policy doctrines that have dominated the GOP for decades.    and   in recent years, she is a former state lawmaker who railed against cozy business relationships within government and did not always click with her party’s leadership.  Her breakout moment on the national stage came with her widely praised handling of last year’s slaying of a prominent minister and eight parishioners at a historic African American church in Charleston. Haley choked back tears at a news conference, saying the “heart and soul of South Carolina was broken. ’’ She was at the forefront of the subsequent debate over whether the Confederate flag should still fly on statehouse grounds, insisting that the legislature remove it. After the flag came down, she told The Washington Post that she has two teenage children and that “I just couldn’t look them in the face and keep that flag up. ”  For Trump, Haley’s ability to build relationships with prominent wealthy donors and figures such as Romney while maintaining her credibility as a   Sarah   executive of a southern state may be a revealing window into how she is up to the task of navigating the swirling spheres of influence in Turtle Bay If confirmed by the Senate, Haley would be replaced by South Carolina Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, a top Trump ally. His ascension is seen inside of Trump’s inner circle as a welcome consequence of her departure, the person said  —   a way to promote them both. During the campaign, Haley was critical of some of Trump’s proposals, such as his temporary ban on Muslims’ entry into the United States.  When she gave the GOP response to President Obama’s State of the Union address this year, Haley criticized the “angriest voices” within national politics and their “siren call” to voters, a line widely seen as a    shot at Trump’s campaign. But when she visited Trump last week, Haley told reporters that she never disliked Trump despite her past comments. “He was a friend and supporter before he ran for president, and was kind to me then. But when I see something I am uncomfortable with, I say it,” she said. “When we met, it was friends who had known each other before. ”   ",-0.5
"Times columnist blasted by ‘nasty left’ for climate change piece. A New York Times columnist who was “harangued” for months by “bullying Trump supporters” says he’s now being blasted by the “nasty left”  —   after he penned a piece about how absurd it was to blindly support climate change, without listening to both sides of the argument. Former Wall Street Journal writer Bret Stephens has now managed to draw ire from the left  As a noted “never Trumper” and climate skeptic, he has seen his fair share of hate mail and Twitter trolls over the past      —   but nothing like what he’s endured since his article was posted, he says. “After 20 months of being harangued by bullying Trump supporters, I’m reminded that the nasty left is no different. Perhaps worse,”   as the hateful messages kept rolling in. “Go eat dog d —  s,” fumed one Twitter user. “When is the Times going to get rid of you?” another asked. Stephens even managed to tick off fellow journalists. “You’re a s —  thead. a crybaby lil f —  kin weenie. a massive twat too,” tweeted Libby Watson, staff writer at Gizmodo. “I’m gonna lose my mind,” seethed Eve Peyser, politics writer at Vice. “The ideas ppl like @BretStephensNYT espouse are violently hateful & should not be given a platform by @NYTimes,” she said. In the column, Stephens never states that he believes climate change is a farce. He simply asserts that people should look at claims from both supporters and deniers, in the attempt to get all the facts. “Anyone who has read the 2014 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change knows that, while the modest (0. 85 degrees Celsius, or about 1. 5 degrees Fahrenheit) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880 is indisputable, as is the human influence on that warming, much else that passes as accepted fact is really a matter of probabilities,” he writes. “That’s especially true of the sophisticated but fallible models and simulations by which scientists attempt to peer into the climate future. To say this isn’t to deny science. It’s to acknowledge it honestly. ” Stephens even describes how he knows people will blast him for the piece, despite the fact he’s arguing for both sides. “By now I can almost hear the heads exploding. They shouldn’t, because there’s another lesson here  —   this one for anyone who wants to advance the cause of good climate policy,” he says. “As Revkin wisely noted, hyperbole about climate ‘not only didn’t fit the science at the time but could even be counterproductive if the hope was to engage a distracted public. ’” Describing the idea in another way, Stephens says: “Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a climate claim proves wrong. “Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts,” he adds. “None of this is to deny climate change or the possible severity of its consequences. But ordinary citizens also have a right to be skeptical of an overweening scientism. They know  —   as all environmentalists should  —   that history is littered with the human wreckage of scientific errors married to political power. ” But social media users didn’t care, with some  —   including several scientists  —   going so far as to order a subscription boycott of the Times on Friday. “Each and every one of us should fully boycott the NY Times  —   don’t link to them, don’t click on their links. Their actions are inexcusable,” wrote one Twitter user. “You cannot be an ostensible    and allow a science denier to spread propaganda. ” Adriana Heguy, a genomics scientist and professor of pathology at NYU, urged her colleagues to scrap their subscriptions, as well. “Composing my letter to the editor today and canceling @nytimes,” she tweeted. “‘Balance’ means a VALID alternative opinion, not pseudoscience. I’m so sad. ”  asking the Times to fire Stephens. It had already garnered more than 25, 000 signatures by 11 p. m. Friday. “The issue is not that climate denial makes New York Times readers uncomfortable,” the description reads. “The issue is that climate denial relies on a foundation of lies. To present lies as if they were reasoned opinion compromises the impartiality, accuracy, and integrity of The New York Times. ” Dear Bret Stephens, We’ve got some good news & some bad news: 1st the good: you’re trending on twitter, now the bad: it’s because you suck.  —   UNITE & FIGHT (@stopthenutjob)     This is so irresponsible.

"Brexit: 9 questions you were too embarrassed to ask.  On Thursday, British voters voted in favor of ”Brexit”  —   British exit from the European Union. That means that the EU is on the verge of losing one of its largest and wealthiest members.    The consequences will be huge for the British people. Britain’s economy and legal system have become deeply integrated with the European continent. Unraveling those relationships is likely to be economically and socially disruptive. On the other side, Brexit advocates have argued that Britain will be better off in the long run outside the EU, with full sovereignty and unfettered control over immigration and economic regulations. ”The risks of Britain staying in the EU far outweigh the risks of us leaving,” argued British journalist Douglas Murray in an interview last week. ”The eurozone has been a disaster, and it’s very important for Britain to get control of our own borders.”   Related  The 7 most important arguments for Britain to leave the EU    On its own, British exit from the EU would be disruptive but not calamitous for other EU countries. The larger threat for other EU members is that Britain could become the first step toward unraveling the EU more generally. The 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis have put the EU’s rickety political institutions under strain. A British exit could further shake peoples’ confidence that the EU project can endure over the long run, causing other countries to eye the exits.    The campaign pitted Britain’s conservative prime minister, David Cameron, against members of his own party who were more skeptical of Britain’s EU membership. The ”Leave” result will have profound consequence for the Conservative party, Great Britain, and the European Union.    1) What is the European Union?             This, as Vox’s Matt Yglesias has written, ”is a bit of a complicated metaphysical question.” The European Union began its life with the 1952 European Coal and Steel Community. European leaders wanted to prevent a repeat of the two world wars by giving European powers  —   especially France and (West) Germany  —   shared economic and political institutions. This gave way to the European Economic Community in 1967, and ultimately the European Union after 1993’s Maastricht Treaty.    Today, the EU includes a political and economic bureaucracy, based in Brussels, that shapes and controls many aspects of European political life. The EU has its own currency, the euro. It has a travel agreement, called Schengen, which makes most of the EU function as one giant country when it comes to travel and migration. However, the dream of a ”United States of Europe” is still quite far from reality. The EU cannot declare war and does not have an independent power to levy taxes. Most people in Europe feel greater loyalty toward their home countries than they do to the European Union as a whole. This lack of   political solidarity has led many EU citizens to be resentful of the degree of control Brussels wields over their lives. This makes the current European equilibrium inherently unstable. If Europe doesn’t become more integrated  —   with a stronger central government and a shared political culture  —   then there’s a danger that nationalistic tensions could cause the whole system to unravel.    2) Why would Britain want to leave the EU? British politics has always included a faction that’s skeptical of deeper integration with the rest of Europe. This faction has grown stronger in recent years as the EU has struggled with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973 and hence the EU in the 1990s. But Britain never fully accepted the legitimacy of European control over British institutions in a way that other EU members did. It refused, for example, to join either the Schengen Area, which eliminates internal border controls, or the common currency. Since 2008, Britain’s background euroskepticism has been amplified by the poor performance of European economies. The   recession was bad in the United States, but it was really bad in the euro area. The eurozone took a greater hit than the US did initially, and then quickly collapsed back into recession rather than experiencing a continued recovery:            There are a number of reasons why this is true, including several EU nations’ embrace of austerity. But one of the biggest, if not the biggest, cause was the euro itself. Central banks are supposed to react to recessions by expanding the money supply in order to promote economic activity. The 2008 financial crisis caught central banks   both in the United States and Europe. But America’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, ultimately responded forcefully to the economic downturn, helping to get the economy growing again starting in 2010.    In contrast, the ECB decided to raise interest rates  —   a contractionary policy  —   in 2011. The result: While the US economy started to heal, the eurozone tipped into a   recession. Things got so bad, particularly in Greece, that it looked like the entire eurozone system could collapse. This didn’t affect the UK directly, as it uses the pound rather than the euro. But some Britons looked at the situation and decided that EU membership was dangerous. The EU had historically only expanded its powers, they worried. How long until Britain got roped into a   disaster  —   or faced pressure to bail out countries whose economies were wrecked by bad eurozone economic policies? This argument gave new potency to Britain’s   euroskepticism. By   after three years of the eurozone crisis with no real end in sight, Prime Minister David Cameron was under significant pressure from members of his own Conservative Party to hold a referendum on whether the UK should stay in. In January 2013, Cameron gave a speech promising to hold just such a referendum if the Tories won Britain’s 2015 election. They did, and then Conservative legislators passed a bill to hold a vote before December 2017. In February, Cameron scheduled the vote for June 23, 2016  —   and here we are. 3) What was the case for the UK to leave the EU?             The arguments for leaving the EU varied depending on which advocates you talked to. But the two most common arguments focused on the EU’s liberal rules for internal migration and the EU’s burdensome economic regulations. Boris Johnson, a Conservative who was then mayor of London, wrote a typical case for Brexit back in February, focusing on the increasing concentration of power in the hands of unelected EU bureaucrats in Brussels:     The more the EU does, the less room there is for national  . Sometimes these EU rules sound simply ludicrous, like the rule that you can’t recycle a teabag, or that children under eight cannot blow up balloons, or the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners. Sometimes they can be truly infuriating  —   like the time I discovered, in 2013, that there was nothing we could do to bring in   cab windows for trucks, to stop cyclists being crushed. It had to be done at a European level, and the French were opposed.  On this view, the EU isn’t just too meddlesome, it’s also undemocratic and unaccountable to the public. ”The issue of sovereignty of who governs you, is the most important question for any country,” British journalist Douglas Murray told me in an interview last week. After two decades in which significant power resided in Brussels, Murray wants to return full authority to the peoples’ elected representatives in the British Parliament. While arguments about economic regulation and political sovereignty dominate the intellectual case for Brexit, the political appeal of Brexit relies heavily on the emotionally charged issue of immigration. Britain refused to participate in the Schengen agreement and fully dismantle border controls with other EU countries. But EU law still requires members to admit an unlimited number of migrants from other EU countries. With the eurozone suffering from dismal economic performance, a lot of workers from less affluent EU states like Poland and Portugal have moved to the UK in search of work. There’s little Britain’s elected officials can do to stem these flows, and that rubs a lot of British voters the wrong way. One of the most prominent critics of the EU’s immigration rules was Nigel Farage, leader of the   UK Independence Party. He argued that   migration of   workers from elsewhere in Europe has depressed wages for   Britons. Farage also suggested that unrestricted immigration from Europe could lead to greater competition for government services and even put British women at greater risk of sexual violence.    Farage is an extreme example  —   something like the Pat Buchanan of the United Kingdom. But like the US, Britain is currently experiencing an upsurge of nativist sentiments, and these attitudes are providing a boost for the campaign to leave the EU. 4) What was the case for the UK to remain in the EU?             British Prime Minister David Cameron was on the other side of the debate, leading the campaign for Britain to stay in the EU. And his argument, like the argument of most supporters of continued EU membership, was largely focused on economics. Not only does the UK experience   economic benefits from being part of one of the world’s largest   zones, advocates argued, but the process of leaving the EU could be highly disruptive, leading to   economic pain. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me last week that the UK gains a lot of benefit from being inside the European club. For example, the harmonization of laws and regulations across the EU means that companies can maintain a single corporate headquarters for all of Europe. And because English is the world’s most widely spoken language, many foreign companies have located their European operations in London. In addition, Cameron argued that EU membership makes Brits more secure by allowing closer coordination among European law enforcement organizations. He also argued that Britain’s EU membership amplifies the UK’s influence on the world stage, and that leaving the EU could cause Britain to become marginalized. 5) Can’t the UK just negotiate favorable access to European markets after leaving the EU?             In theory, an independent Britain could negotiate a deal with the EU that grants British businesses the same kind of preferential access to the EU that they enjoy now. Indeed, Norway has just this kind of deal: It’s not a EU member, but the country has agreed to voluntarily abide by most EU rules, and in exchange it enjoys most of the economic privileges of EU membership.    One problem is that EU leaders may not be in a forgiving mood after a British vote to leave. Many European countries have domestic euroskeptical movements of their own, and European leaders are worried that a successful British exit could embolden them. So the EU may refuse to give the UK a favorable deal as a warning to other countries thinking about exiting the EU. Another problem is that Britain may not want a   deal. To gain preferred access, Norway is required to adopt many EU regulations. A recent British government report found that ”Norway has adopted three quarters of the EU’s rules and legislation.” So if the point of leaving the EU is to escape its burdensome regulations, it’s not obvious that the Norwegian model will accomplish that. And while euroskeptics have complained that the EU is not sufficiently accountable to British voters, voters in Norway have no influence at all over EU laws that  —   in many cases  —   Norway’s legislature must approve without modification in order to gain access to the European common market. To a large extent, then, unfettered access to European markets and diminished British sovereignty are a package deal. It’s never going to be possible for the United Kingdom to retain full control over domestic regulation while enjoying access to EU markets on par with the access available to other EU member states. 6) Can we take a music break? Sure! As you might know, the UK has a pretty solid musical tradition. A good musical interlude for this particular explainer is ”Should I Stay or Should I Go?” It was recorded by the British band the Clash and released in 1982:  .    .  iframe, .  object, .  embed        7) What has happened since Thursday’s results were announced? British voters voted for Leave by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. As the results were reported on Thursday evening, markets started to panic. The British pound fell from $1. 50 earlier in the day to $1. 35 in the early hours of Friday morning. That 10 percent drop brought the pound to its lowest value against the dollar since the 1980s. British Prime Minister David Cameron had vowed to continue in office even if British voters opted to Leave. but by Friday morning his position had become politically untenable. He has announced plans to leave his post by October. We don’t know who will succeed him. Boris Johnson, a Conservative former mayor of London and Leave supporter, is considered a leading candidate to replace Cameron. But it’s also possible that the Conservative Party will become so fractured that Parliament will deadlock and be forced to call new elections. 8) What will happen next?             Leaving the EU isn’t simply a matter of declaring ”I quit!” Article 50, the EU constitution provision that sets exit rules, allows for the EU and the UK to negotiate over the terms of Britain’s exit. At issue is whether any EU treaties and laws would continue to apply to the UK after it’s gone. After the British invoke Article 50, the parties will have a   window in which to cut a deal. If time runs out without a deal (or without the parties unanimously agreeing to continue negotiations) then the UK’s membership in the EU would automatically expire. This could have dramatic consequences. At a minimum, a lot of people will have to do extra paperwork. EU citizens in Britain and Brits living in other EU nations will have to update their immigration statuses. Companies operating in both the UK and the EU will have to verify that they’re compliant with two sets of laws. And things could get uglier if the two sides aren’t able to compromise.    ”If you are Nissan or some other car producer with major production in the UK, today, the same safety standards and environmental standards allow you to sell everywhere in the European market,” Kirkegaard told me. But if the UK leaves the EU, ”you would no longer be able to sell into other European markets, not because you face a small tariff, but because you’d have to go through another set of safety certifications. This kind of thing would be repeated in every industry you can think of.” Critics say the economic effects could be large. The UK government estimated that exiting the EU could cause the British economy to be between 3. 8 and 7. 5 percent smaller by 2030  —   depending on how well negotiations for access to the European market ultimately go. Other reports have found smaller, but still significant impacts. And Kirkegaard said that Brexit could also change the United Kingdom in another fundamental way. It’s called the ”United” Kingdom because it’s made up of four ”countries”  —   England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. But if the United Kingdom votes to leave the EU, it may not stay united for very long. Polls have shown that people in Scotland and Northern Ireland broadly support remaining in the EU. And the Scots in particular have never been entirely satisfied with English domination, as shown by the 44 percent of Scottish people who voted to make Scotland an independent country in 2014. They like having the UK be part of the EU in part because it provides a counterweight to English power within the UK. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said that she wants to see a second referendum on Scottish independence. That could lead to an independent Scotland (which would most likely petition for admission to the EU in its own right). A similar process could lead to the reunification of Northern Ireland with the nation of Ireland (itself already an EU member). 9) I skipped to the end of the article. Why should Americans care about this?            British exit from the European Union could be disruptive for Britain and for the EU more generally. Even skeptics like Kirkegaard don’t expect a British exit to trigger a global recession, but turmoil in one of our most important trading partners can’t be good for the US economy.    But the more important issue from an American perspective is about geopolitics more than economics. Ever since World War II, the United States has been deeply invested in safeguarding   peace and prosperity in Europe. We still have thousands of troops stationed in Germany to help maintain the status quo there, and we’ve worked to build a system of alliances that helps to minimize the possibility of conflict. A British decision to leave the EU isn’t going to pose an immediate threat to this political order. But it could signal growing dissatisfaction with the status quo among European voters. That could have unpredictable results. We’ve already seen the fall of David Cameron, a man whose policies have generally been friendly to the United States and the established global order. He could be replaced by a more euroskeptical leader on the right. Or if the results of British exit are as bad as critics predict, it could discredit the British right and bring the Labour Party’s   leader Jeremy Corbyn to power in the next election. A win for British euroskeptics could also provide a boost to skeptics of the EU elsewhere in Europe. With many countries continuing to suffer through a   recession, that could cause other countries to seriously consider leaving the EU, ultimately causing the EU to unravel. None of this will necessarily be bad for the United States  —   Europe might muddle through and ultimately emerge stronger and more prosperous. But the peace and stability of the EU era has been broadly good for Americans and the world, so turmoil in Europe is cause for worry. ",-1.0

"Chinese investors drive bitcoin value to record high. The total value of all bitcoins in circulation hit a record high above $14 billion on Thursday, as the   digital currency jumped 5 percent on the day to its highest levels in three years after more than doubling in price this year. The price of one bitcoin reached $875 on the   Bitstamp exchange, its strongest level since January 2014, putting the cryptocurrency on track for its best daily performance in six months. That compared with levels around $435 at the start of the year, with many experts linking bitcoin’s rise with the steady depreciation of the Chinese yuan, which has slid almost 7 percent this year. Data shows the majority of bitcoin trading is done in China, so any increase in demand from there tends to have a significant impact on the price. Bitcoin is a   “cryptocurrency” that can move money across the globe quickly and anonymously with no need for a central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China’s. The digital currency is still some way off the peaks it scaled in late 2013, when it traded as high as $1, 163 on the Bitstamp exchange. But because more bitcoins continue to be added to the system, currently at a rate of 12. 5 every 10 minutes, its total value  —   or “market cap”  —   on Thursday surpassed the 2013 peak of around $14. 01 billion. That puts its total value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company. Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, said bitcoin had been helped higher by demonetization in India, and by global political uncertainty.",1.0
"Inside the life of a dancer found dead in a strip club. A man has been arrested as part of a police probe into the death of a British woman at the lapdance club where she worked in Australia. The body of   29, was discovered at Dreams Gentlemen’s Club in Melbourne, Australia, on Dec. 19. A former dancer at the strip club where Stacey died believes   in a private “Fantasy Room. ” We reveal all. Stacey Tierney was originally a fitness instructor from Manchester and was   where she had been working. The    who is also understood to have worked at two other Melbourne clubs, had been living in Australia for three years. Friends told Australian media that the former fitness trainer, whose social media profiles were filled with pictures of herself in bikinis on board yachts, was a healthy girl who avoided drugs and was streetwise. Other friends said Stacey, who had two sisters and a brother, wanted to become a nurse and “liked to have a drink” but did not take drugs. She told friends via her Facebook page earlier this year that she was soaking up the sun in Queensland and didn’t have a firm plan for the future. It was reported she had been working at Dreams for just five weeks before she died. Dreams, in Melbourne’s Central Business District, is a small underground venue where patrons pass under a glittering   sign as they walk downstairs. A friend who saw her just before she died said she told him “she was loving life and settled into a nice place. ” Victoria police have said she had been with several men who had access to the strip club she was working at. The men possibly left after she died and    —   just before midday Dec. 19. Initial reports suggested the fitness fanatic was in a private room dubbed a “Fantasy Room” that is not covered by CCTV cameras. But a former dancer   that if Stacey was in a private room,  . She is adamant that all the private rooms had cameras installed  —   which suggests police may have detailed footage of Stacey’s final hours. “All the private rooms, the ‘lap rooms,’ are covered,” she insisted. Stacey’s family was mostly   to support herself in Australia and only learned of it after her death. Stephen, her father, was heartbroken by the loss of his “beautiful” daughter. “We are finding it difficult to get information, and realize there is an investigation regarding the suspicious circumstances,” he said. The Sun revealed this week that   with the lure of earning up to £1, 500 ($1, 862) a night, with Aussie men said to love the British accents and their reputation as party girls. Victoria police have confirmed a    from Ascot Vale was arrested March 28 on suspicion of perjury. He was questioned by officers before being released pending a summons charge. Police have been   about their inquiry but  . They had been awaiting toxicology reports that they hoped would help determine how she died. The inquiry is focusing on   activities at Dreams. News Corp. understands associates of Stacey failed to call cops for fear of attracting a police investigation into the club. It is not clear if the men present left the club before she was discovered or emergency services were called. Police have refused to say if any other staff members were in Stacey Tierney’s group on Dec. 18 The mystery group of men and other customers at the club are now being sought by the city’s police. Although there is no suggestion of foul play at this stage, sources said Melbourne’s homicide squad was monitoring the investigation.   footage of the club was also being screened by police, although private rooms in the club are not believed to have cameras. “The exact circumstances surrounding the English woman’s death are yet to be determined and a   will be conducted,” she said. In a statement, the owners, staff and management said they “extend their sincere sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of Stacey Tierney, who recently passed away. ” The statement said they were cooperating with Victoria police with their “ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding Stacey’s death. ” “However, until such time as all the facts are known and the police investigation has concluded, we are unable to make any further comment or statements in relation to this matter. ” This article   on  .",1.0
"Survey Finds Conservatives Feel Out of Place in Silicon Valley. In recent weeks, uproar over Silicon Valley’s alleged bias against conservatives has intensified—from Project Veritas secretly filming Twitter employees to fired Google engineer James Damore suing his former employer for allegedly discriminating against whites, males, and conservatives at a company that is 69 percent white and 56 percent male. Now Lincoln Network, a right-leaning political group for tech workers, wants to enter the fray as a voice of reason—armed with data. “I think everyone agrees that this topic is not going away,” says Lincoln Network cofounder Garrett Johnson, a former Rhodes Scholar who sold his Y Combinator-backed messaging startup in 2016. Johnson says Lincoln Network wants to “constructively engage in this conversation,” in hopes of improving the work environment at tech companies. Over the past couple of months, Lincoln Network conducted an online survey of 387 employees of companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber, and Salesforce, plus one-on-one interviews with 23 respondents who agreed to speak anonymously. Respondents volunteered to take the survey after seeing the link online or on internal forums at companies like Google. The survey found employees who identify as conservative or very conservative are increasingly uncomfortable at work. Two-thirds or more of respondents who describe themselves as libertarian, conservative or very conservative say they feel less comfortable sharing their ideological views with colleagues since Google fired Damore in August. But only 30 percent of liberals and 14 percent of people who say they are very liberal feel that way. Johnson says he hopes the survey sparks a broader conversation about ideological tolerance in the workplace. Employers should care because if conservatives feel like they can't bring their ""whole self"" to work that could affect performance, he says, referencing a popular mantra in the tech industry, which has been usually supportive of free expression in the workplace. The results represent an incredibly narrow self-selecting sample of tech workers. The subset of  “very conservative” employees, for instance, encompasses just 20 individuals. However, respondents were fairly well dispersed across the ideological spectrum. The largest subset, 24 percent, identified as libertarian; 17.6 percent identified as conservative, 5.2 percent identified as very conservative, 16.3 percent identified as moderate, 18.3 percent identified as liberal, and 11.1 percent as very liberal. The survey did not ask which views respondents felt were being silenced. Johnson says conservative tech workers have told him they feel uncomfortable discussing traditional views of marriage or family. “The issue of cultural norms when it comes to family and sexual orientation, those are difficult conversations, they are just intensified in the Bay Area,” Johnson says. One Salesforce employee who participated in the survey, but did not want to be named, says he didn’t vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 election for fear it might hurt his career if it became known. “I have trouble believing that they would be able to make a rational decision about that person’s promotion or career growth or endorsement of that person,” knowing that the person voted for Trump, he says. A Salesforce spokesperson says, “Voting is a private matter. However, Salesforce is proud to have 30,000 employees who bring a diverse set of views and perspectives to our workplace.” Mike Wacker, a Google software engineer who did not respond to the survey, says being a Republican at a tech company feels similar to being a Republican in college. “In both environments, you're often the token Republican, and Republicans are deeply unpopular,” he says. “But I felt more comfortable as a Republican in college than I feel now as a Republican in tech."" The survey also asked about sharing viewpoints “in a casual work context, if the subject of politics or culture were raised.” Sixty percent of the very conservative group said they would “never” share their views, compared to just 4.7 percent of very liberals. Aside from very conservative employees, roughly 40 percent of the other groups said they would decide whether to share a viewpoint based on the issue and their perception of others’ views. The Lincoln Network survey was framed as a questionnaire about “viewpoint diversity,” a fraught term favored for years by conservatives that has enjoyed a resurgence in Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg invoked the importance of a diversity of viewpoints when Facebook was pressured to remove Peter Thiel from its board of directors after he donated to Trump’s campaign. Damore also used the term in his memo, although his views on whether women are less biologically predisposed to become engineers was not explicitly a political argument. Ellen Pao, one of the cofounders of Project Include, a nonprofit that advises tech companies about making their workplace more welcoming, says the use of the term “diversity” to describe views like Damore’s can confuse the issue, particularly within the tech industry, which has become as polarized as the tech platforms they operate. The majority group, “who have had the ability to say whatever they want for so long,” are now feeling marginalized and censored,” says Pao. “It’s interesting to see how unpleasant they find it.” Johnson, however, argues that companies that champion tolerance should also prioritize making conservatives feel welcome, particularly because some of the divisiveness in political discourse stems from platforms built by Silicon Valley. Johnson, who grew up going to a predominantly black church and went to a Southern Baptist high school, says, there needs to be a way “to understand how to navigate those more challenging conversations.”",0.0
"Pentagon grudgingly accepts Syria deal amid deep mistrust of Russia.  Hours after reaching an agreement on Syria last Friday with Secretary of State John F. Kerry and clearing the final deal with Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov wandered the halls of their meeting venue in Geneva, waiting for Kerry to get the okay from Washington.  In a secure room upstairs, a frustrated Kerry was on hold. Already deep into a conference call with President Obama’s top national security team, he was waiting for the Defense Department to locate its legal counsel to sign off on one of the many provisions of the accord that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter was questioning.  [Syria has not granted ‘a single permit’ to aid besieged Aleppo, says U. N. official]  “I hope before Washington gets some sleep, we can get some news,” Lavrov said as he offered pizza and vodka to reporters awaiting an announcement. Clearly on a propaganda roll, he observed that the wheels of government appeared to turn more efficiently in his country than in the United States. Obama, who did not attend the principals’ meeting, ultimately approved the agreement and a news conference was held at midnight, Geneva time.   Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confer in Geneva on Sept. 9 at the end of a joint news conference following their meeting to discuss the crisis in Syria. (Kevin  )  But beneath the politics and diplomacy of the deal  —   which began with a   Monday, to be followed, if it succeeds, by coordinated U. S.  counterterrorism airstrikes  —   the prospect of    cooperation does not sit well with the Defense Department. “There is a trust deficit with the Russians; it is not clear to us what their objectives are,” Gen. Joseph L. Votel, head of the U. S. Central Command, said Wednesday. “They say one thing, and we don’t necessarily see them following up on this. ”  [As Russia reasserts itself, U. S. intelligence agencies focus anew on the Kremlin]  That mistrust resides most deeply in Carter, who officials familiar with the Russia negotiations said almost   delayed Friday’s final agreement with his repeated questions during the conference call. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voiced little objection during the principals’ meeting, officials said. But Pentagon officials acknowledged widespread concern that Russia will not live up to its end of the deal, and fears that the U. S. military will be blamed for problems or the failure of an initiative it does not fully support. Many are still smarting from criticism and derision over an earlier program to build up an army of U. S.  Syrian fighters that repeatedly stumbled and ultimately was abandoned.  Kerry and other proponents of the agreement say that they are similarly wary of Russian intentions, but that they do not see another way to stop the civil war in Syria, while retaining focus on what the administration views as the far more important battle against the Islamic State and without a major U. S. intervention that Obama has repeatedly rejected. “What’s the alternative?” Kerry asked in an interview with NPR this week. “The alternative is to allow us to go from 450, 000 people who’ve been slaughtered to how many thousands more? That Aleppo gets completely overrun? That the Russians and [Syrian President Bashar  ] Assad simply bomb indiscriminately for days to come, and we sit there and do nothing? That’s the alternative to trying to get this done, if America is not going to go in with their troops  —   and America’s made the decision we’re not going in with our troops. ”     Residents in the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo are enjoying a rare moment of peace, with the latest ceasefire holding for another day. (Reuters)   Amid reports of internal administration clashes, and after a terse and somewhat grudging initial Pentagon statement saying “we will be watching” the Russians to make sure they comply, the White House said Wednesday that Obama is not looking for “a bunch of people that have the exact same opinion. ”  But the president, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, is “entirely confident that once he’s made a decision, that he can count on the members of his team to execute that strategy with excellence. ” After commending Kerry for the deal, Carter said at a Wednesday news conference in Austin, “We in the Defense Department will play whatever role we have with our accustomed excellence. ” Although many Republicans, and some Democrats, have criticized Obama for years for his reluctance to become involved in Syria’s domestic combat  —   and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused him of not listening to his generals  —   it is the generals who have been most averse to a direct role in the civil war.  [How Russian special forces are shaping the fight in Syria]  “Dempsey was throwing himself under a bus in front of every idea that came out,” said a senior administration official, referring to former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Martin E. Dempsey, whom Dunford replaced last fall. The Defense Department “got the Iraq part, but it was the Syria thing  —   even the   part  —   that they didn’t want. My theory is that everyone in DOD understands Iraq, and they don’t understand Syria. ” ISIL is an acronym for the Islamic State. But military leaders share a   skepticism about whether the United States can change the course of the Syrian conflict at this stage, or, more broadly, can bring about lasting change anywhere in the Middle East. During the   negotiations with Moscow that led to last week’s U. S.  agreement, the Pentagon argued against more intervention and a diplomatic deal. “Any collusion with Russia” has just made the   reluctance to intervene worse, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Under the   terms of the deal, Russia is responsible for ensuring that the Syrian air force stops attacks against opposition forces and civilians, and the United States has pledged to do the same with those opposition groups it backs. If violence is substantially reduced for seven consecutive days  —   a period that began Monday night  —   and humanitarian aid begins to reach besieged communities, U. S. and Russian military and intelligence officials will establish a Joint Implementation Center. There, they will share intelligence about the location of the two groups they both agree are terrorists and ineligible for a  : the Islamic State and the former Jabhat   which has renamed itself Jabhat Fatah   (Front for the Conquest of Syria) and claims to have severed ties with  . They will discuss and agree on legitimate targets and determine which of them is best situated to launch airstrikes against them. U. S. military officials are working internally on ways to develop potential Front targets in areas where U. S. aircraft have not been recently active. Officials from the U. S. Central Command, the European Command, and Dunford’s office, along with the Pentagon’s intelligence shop, are among those working out the details of how the Center would operate, including personnel, logistics and how to obtain the surveillance information required to support the expanded air campaign. Commanders are keen to ensure that operations with Russia would not divert planes or other assets from current operations targeting the Islamic State, and that Russia would follow rules in its use of target information. They are concerned about providing some legal protection to the Pentagon in the case of, for example, Russian aircraft striking a civilian target. To mitigate that risk, one possibility under consideration is a system in which the United States would develop a target, Russia would approve it and the United States would take the strike, and vice versa. It’s not clear whether Russia, whose airstrikes have hit hospitals and civilian areas, will shift to using precision munitions in the jointly agreed strikes. Under a measure lawmakers inserted into the defense appropriations bill after Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine,    cooperation with Russia is prohibited unless the defense secretary waives its provisions, notifies Congress and explains why the waiver is in the United States’ interest. Congressional aides said the House and Senate armed services committees thought that such notification should have taken place last fall, when Washington signed a “deconfliction” memorandum with Moscow to ensure that their separate air operations against the Islamic State in Syria would not run into each other. The committees chose not to challenge a Pentagon assertion that the agreement was a “safety” issue and did not fall under the waiver requirement. Following the new   and coordination deal, aides said, lawmakers have already requested waiver information from the Pentagon but have not yet received an answer. Pentagon lawyers have determined that establishment of the Joint Implementation Center would trigger the notification and waiver requirement, although the Department’s legal counsel, during last Friday’s conference call with Kerry, indicated that it did not have to be immediate. Pentagon lawyers are still exploring whether and when, during the planning stage, notification has to take place. Some military officials are asking, for example, whether they are permitted to talk to the Russian military as they make plans to open the center. Late Wednesday, a Pentagon statement said that senior Defense Department civilians and military officers had held a video conference with their Russian counterparts about ongoing   safety “to avoid accidents and misunderstandings in the air space over Syria. ” The meeting, the statement emphasized, “was not part of separate discussions taking place on the possible   of the joint integration cell. ”   Thomas   and William Wan contributed to this report.

"To Fix Its Toxic Ad Problem, Facebook Must Break Itself. It is a sure sign that Facebook’s algorithms have run amok when they allow anyone to target ads to people with an expressed interest in burning Jews. Likewise, when Russians can sow chaos in American elections by purchasing thousands of phony Facebook ads without Facebook realizing it, the automated systems selling those ads may need some oversight. Two incidents in recent weeks have highlighted how Facebook’s advertising network—the cornerstone of its half-trillion-dollar valuation—is as susceptible to manipulation and bigotry as its news feed. Facebook addresses each problem as it arises, in isolation. But maybe it’s time for Facebook to acknowledge that it can’t solve these problems alone and to ask for help—before governments offer their own “help.” ",0.0
"‘I thought, this is it’: One man’s escape from an Islamic State mass execution.        SAFIYA, Iraq  —   Blindfolded and bound, his knees pressing into the dirt, Imad resigned himself to what seemed inevitable: He was going to die.  Islamic State gunmen had driven him and about 90 other former Iraqi police and army officers to a remote industrial area on the edge of Hamam   10 miles south of Mosul, after rounding them up from their villages last month.  Iraqi security forces were approaching, and the militants were losing their grip on the area.  Packed into two pickup trucks and a bus, the men were told they were being taken to see their families, but they were instead slated for execution.  Imad’s truck was the first to be unloaded, and he was the first in line. A militant took him by the arm.  He walked around 10 yards.  He was ordered to kneel down.  “I thought, ‘This is it, it’s over,’ ” he said as he recounted his ordeal from his home in the village of Safiya. “We’ve lived under the rule of Islamic State for more than two years, and we know that nobody survives such things. ”  The gunmen opened fire. Imad’s account of what happened that day provides a rare firsthand view of the brutality that has become a notorious hallmark of the Islamic State’s rule.  The militants have steadily lost ground since Iraqi forces began their offensive to recapture Mosul a month ago, breaking into the city from the east and capturing towns and villages to the south.  Increasingly cornered, they have fought to hold their last remaining stronghold in Iraq any way they can. They have held civilians as human shields and dispatched hundreds of car bombs.  Inside the city and other areas on the outskirts under their control, they have also lashed out with mass arrests and summary executions. Those who served in the police and army have borne the brunt of recent mass killings, whether they were accused of collaborating with the advancing forces, or simply attacked out of vengeance.     An Iraqi Federal Police officer examines human remains at a site of a mass grave of victims of Islamic State militants in Hamam  . (Marko  )  The United Nations reported last week that the Islamic State had abducted 295 former members of the Iraqi security forces from areas around Mosul. It also said that 50 former police officers were executed in Hamam   last month. Imad said nearly double that number were killed at the place he was taken, which is near a cement factory northwest of the town.  Iraqi police forces said Monday that they found a mass grave at that location containing around 100 bodies, corroborating Imad’s account. Police spokesman Ammar   said they are thought to be the bodies of former police officers rounded up after the Mosul operation began. That follows the discovery of another mass grave at a   agricultural college in the town after it was retaken by security forces this month. Iraqi security officials have also estimated that grave contains around 100 bodies. In the days after Iraqi security forces began their offensive last month, the Islamic State rounded up entire villages farther south, forcing families to retreat to Mosul with them. Thousands arrived in Imad’s village of Safiya, on their way north to Hamam  .      There were rumors that former police and army officers were being targeted for execution. When the Islamic State seized Mosul and surrounding towns and cities two and a half years ago, police and army officers were allowed to stay in their territory if they repented through a process known as “towba. ”  But they were still viewed with suspicion, Imad said. That worsened as the militants’ control began to crumble.  Imad had served on the police force for seven years.  He was at home with his wife and child when the militants announced over loudspeakers attached to vehicles that all men and boys 15 and older should gather at the mosque. “They said anyone who disobeyed would be killed,” said Imad, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be published because his wife and child are still in Islamic State territory.  “The Islamic State was breathing its last breath, so I decided to run,” he said.  He took off but was caught by the militants about 100 yards from his home and taken to where the men were gathered.  Former police and army officers were separated from the rest, loaded into trucks and cars and driven north to Hamam  . Civilians, including Imad’s wife and baby, were marched on foot. Imad was held in a house with more than 200 others from his village and communities around it. Those who had left the security forces before the Islamic State took control in 2014 were released, as were those who had worked as security guards for infrastructure such as oil facilities.  Around 90 remained.      A man helps Iraqi Federal Police officers break through a wall as they inspect a former prison used by Islamic State militants in Hamam  . (Marko  )  The militants filmed each one, forcing them to give their names and the positions they once held in the security forces.  They were blindfolded and their hands were bound. A prisoner asked one of the captors a question. Imad didn’t hear it, but he heard the response.  “You are going to hell,” the militant replied. That’s when Imad knew for sure the fate that awaited them.  They were loaded into trucks and driven for half an hour along a dirt road.  It was dark by the time they reached the spot near the cement factory.  “I thought of my wife and son and how I’d never see them again,” he said.  When the gunmen opened fire, he felt a bullet hit his leg.  “I got shot, but I didn’t know how many times,” he said. “I felt things hitting my back. ”  He fell forward into the dirt and pretended to be dead. He heard a commotion as someone from one of the other trucks tried to escape. The gunmen were distracted.  “They were screaming and shouting,” he said. “As soon as I heard that, I saw my chance. ”  His hands had been only loosely bound with rope. He pulled them apart, tore off his blindfold and ran. It was only then that he realized he had been only lightly injured, a bullet grazing his leg. His back had been hit by stones kicked up by the bullets.  “It was dark. Maybe they weren’t that focused,” he said. “It seems they were just shooting randomly. ”  A steep bank prevented the militants from chasing him in their vehicles. He walked all night before reaching an area controlled by security forces.  Some 22 former officers from his village died that day.   “As for me, I’ve seen death, and I feel reborn,” he said. He worries about life under Iraqi forces, who he said damaged property in the village as they retook it.  Still, nothing will compare to the brutality of life under the Islamic State, he said: “Those people are monsters, killers; they don’t have any humanity. ”   Aaso Ameen Shwan in Safiya and Mustafa Salim in Irbil contributed to this report.

"The People vs. O.J. Simpson is the best new show of the winter.  The O. J. Simpson murder trial was a circus; most of us would agree that much is true. An unending barrage of oddities, it left America with a hangover and a bad taste in its mouth, to the degree that the trial mostly disappeared from pop culture after it concluded in 1995. (There was one CBS miniseries dramatization in 2000, but nobody watched.)        Rating  4. 5     So the last thing we should want is a   TV series about the trial  —   especially one that comes from the mind of Ryan Murphy, the mad carnival barker behind such glittering TV pop catastrophes as Glee and American Horror Story. Such a project holds all the potential of turning the circus into a whirling spaceship, floating off into the sky before it finally explodes. But The People vs. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, debuting on FX on Tuesday, February 2, is actually good. In some episodes, it’s really good, and even when not everything clicks, it’s relentlessly addictive, returning the primacy to a story that was ceded to the tabloids long ago. The miniseries digs deeper than you’d expect, poking at the messy intersections of race, gender, and class that so much TV still shies away from, and it will remind you, time and again, of bits and pieces of the trial you’d completely forgotten about. Perhaps the best argument in its favor is this: The series understands the tension that underlies every interaction between black Americans and the police  —   but it’s also deeply aware of the irony that the one man who was able to use that fact to earn acquittal in a criminal case almost certainly committed the crime he was accused of.    Here are five things that make The People vs. O. J. Simpson the best new show of the winter.    1) The performances are wonderful (for the most part)             The O. J. Simpson trial was full of outsize personalities, the kind of people an actor could easily portray as too campy and over the top. The People vs. O. J. Simpson, however, keeps things on a relatively even keel. There are moments that tip over into ridiculousness  —   with younger versions of the Kardashian kids haunting the proceedings like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, how could they not? But the center of the story brings a certain level of dignity to the lawyers and other court personnel who became punchlines over the course of the long, long, long trial.    Of particular note are Sarah Paulson’s Marcia Clark and Courtney B. Vance’s Johnnie Cochran, two hugely experienced lawyers who respectively find themselves unable to leap from a sinking ship and pushing the case ever further into theatrics. With them on either side are a very good Sterling K. Brown as overmatched prosecutor Christopher Darden and a hugely enjoyable Nathan Lane as opportunistic defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a restrained, conflicted performance as Simpson, alternating between the beloved figure of his   Brentwood community and a man prone to rages, someone who very well seems capable of killing his  . The one false note belongs to the biggest name. John Travolta turns up as defense attorney Robert Shapiro, and all through the series’ first six episodes (out of 10) he feels a little thin, more of a caricature than a fully developed human being. But one mediocre turn in a cast this large  —   there are dozens of great actors I haven’t mentioned  —   is an acceptable batting average.    2) The scripts stick to the facts, but leave room for commentary At the center of the O. J. Simpson trial was a black man whose defense team successfully argued that he was targeted and framed by the police. He was also a man who’d frequently had   with the police after his wife called to report his abuse of her. And finally, he was very rich, and thus able to retain the best legal representation out there. The story, in other words, is sort of like a Venn diagram intersection of every single issue that gets under this country’s skin and makes it act up. That’s part of why the case monopolized the national dialogue in the  ’90s. But The People vs. O. J. Simpson doesn’t overplay its hand. It relies on the audience to tease out most of these ideas, focusing on the strange ironies and odd moments at the heart of the story. Such Venn diagram intersections are where the The People vs. O. J. Simpson’s showrunners  —   screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski  —   have made their name, in films as varied as The People vs. Larry Flynt and Man on the Moon. Both writers wield a subtle touch when needed, which makes the more farcical moments of the whole enterprise land with greater comedic punch. 3) The direction is discombobulating             If there’s an element of the series that will leave some viewers running for the exits, it’s probably the direction. Four episodes were directed by Murphy, who’s always been a stronger visual stylist than writer, and he opted to fill them with shots where the camera swirls around the characters, picking up speed as events grow more and more heated. But I found Murphy’s tactic to be neatly discombobulating. The O. J. trial seemed to send everybody spinning off their axes, so Murphy has found a way to replicate that in a single camera movement. The People vs. O. J. Simpson depicts a nation that’s circling the drain but never quite going down it, improbably staying afloat. Other episodes in the miniseries were directed by Anthony Hemingway and Boyz n the Hood’s John Singleton, and both men turn their episodes into riveting chess matches, with lots of   of lawyers strategizing and contemplating each other’s weaknesses, to the degree that victims Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman almost become afterthoughts during the trial  —   just like they were in real life. It’s often brilliant.    4) The ’90s nostalgia is strong in this one From the Jonathan Taylor Thomas poster adorning a wall in li’l Kim Kardashian’s bedroom (where Simpson tries to kill himself!) to every piece of the trial being recreated down to the closest possible detail, The People vs. O. J. Simpson aims to resurrect a past that’s recent enough to be remembered but distant enough to be a little foggy. There’s something noteworthy to this idea. The People vs. O. J. Simpson isn’t just nostalgic for the sake of being nostalgic. The miniseries is a poison Valentine about the birth of the modern era. Cellphones might be gigantic (and essentially bound to the cars they come with) and the internet might essentially be a   but buried within this series is a somewhat serious argument that the O. J. Simpson trial marked the beginning of the world we live in today. In particular, the series is fascinated by the continued intrusion of technology  —   represented here by television cameras  —   into the lives of everyone, and how that makes it easier for just about anybody to become a star. There’s a perhaps   scene where Robert Kardashian (a   David Schwimmer) tells his daughters that the name Kardashian stands for ”hard work,” and it feels occasionally like an elbow to the ribs. But the series also observes how the girls notice the fame brought by cameras, presenting it as a kind of addictive substance that a whole country would soon begin to imbibe. It’s impossible not to end up intoxicated. 5) It’s Making a Murderer, but from the exact opposite angle             Think about it. Both stories are about legal defense teams who attempt to argue their client was framed by prejudicial law enforcement officials. Both stories feature cops who are most likely corrupt  —   even if they came to the right conclusions about these particular cases. And both stories detail the problems that money introduces in our legal system. But where Making a Murderer was about how hard it is to be poor in the American courtroom, The People vs. O. J. Simpson is about how it’s all but impossible to convict someone who’s rich enough to pay for the best lawyers available. The series makes it riveting to watch Simpson’s legal team cook up strategies that are seemingly impossible to succeed, because you know what’s coming. They can’t possibly sell any of this to the jury  —   but you know they do. That’s the tension within both works: a legal system (like everything else) that’s as much about how much money somebody has as anything else. If Making a Murderer plays that idea as bleak tragedy, The People vs. O. J. Simpson keeps an unswerving  ’  smile plastered on its face as it sinks into the abyss.    The People vs. O. J.

"Groundhog Day 2017: did Punxsutawney Phil see his shadow?.  Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog meteorologist of central Pennsylvania, saw his shadow this morning  —   so, according to legend, 2017 will bring more winter weather.    But if you were enjoying those January days that felt like spring, take heart. Phil isn’t a particularly accurate meteorologist, according to an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks climate data in the US. The last time Phil successfully predicted the weather was 2014, when he saw his shadow and both February and March had   temperatures. Before that, the last successful prediction was in 1999. The roots of Groundhog Day in superstitions about bears Every February 2, thousands of people gather on Gobbler’s Knob, a hill outside town in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. They wait for hours in the   freezing cold, and while there are bonfires and fireworks, the highlight is a brief moment when 15 men in top hats report whether a famous groundhog  —   the one they call the ”Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Prognosticator of Prognosticators”  —   saw his shadow.    It’s based on a very old superstition that the weather on February 2 predicts what the rest of winter will be like. On the Christian liturgical calendar, February 2 is Candlemas Day. And fear that a sunny Candlemas Day means a longer winter is widespread in folklore from throughout Europe in the form of rhyming proverbs:     English fishermen: ”When the wind’s in the east on Candlemas Day   There it will stick till the first of May.” An old German proverb: ”The shepherd would rather see the wolf enter his stable on Candlemas Day than the sun.” In Scotland: ”If Candlemas Day be dry and fair   the half o’ winter’s to come and mair [more].”  Some of these superstitions, including in Germany, England, and Eastern Europe, were linked to animals, particularly bears. The bear, which hibernates in the winter and returns to the spring, is a symbol of rebirth after the long winter. If a bear saw its shadow on Candlemas Day, the superstition went, it would return to its den, foretelling a longer winter. As classical scholar Rhys Carpenter wrote in 1946, this alluded to hibernation as a mythical descent into death:     The bear emerging from his deathlike winter sleep, having lain as one dead, must have dwelt among the land of shades and therefore should have left his shadow behind him. If he has not done so, if an accusing shadow moves beside him in the warm spring sunlight, he has not truly been among the dead and he must go back and properly sleep his winter sleep of the full six weeks before he can finally emerge again.  This superstition changed over time with the local fauna. In Germany, the bear became a hedgehog. When Germans emigrated to Pennsylvania, the hedgehog became a groundhog. Groundhog Day’s faux mythology is a masterpiece of marketing           Bill Murray made Punxsutawney’s Groundhog Day famous.    Groundhog Day’s roots might be in European traditions and mythology. But the phenomenon of Punxsutawney’s Groundhog Day is a creation of a force more modern than superstition: the media. The pomp and pageantry of Groundhog Day was created by a local newspaper editor in Punxsutawney in the 1880s. The superstition that groundhogs could predict the weather had already traveled to Pennsylvania from Germany, and local newspapers printed reports on whether groundhogs saw their shadow on Candlemas. But the idea that Punxsutawney Phil predicted the weather not just for a small town in Pennsylvania but for the entire country was the result of tireless promotion by a   newspaper editor in the 1880s. The Punxsutawney Spirit and the local Groundhog Club declared that Phil was the one true   groundhog. The accompanying ceremony, though, didn’t become a national event until after television was invented. It was made famous by morning television (a live audience in Punxsutawney was first allowed in 1966) and popularized by the 1993 Bill Murray comedy (which incorrectly located the main event downtown rather than on Gobbler’s Knob).

"A retired general spoke forcefully for Clinton. Now Trump is attacking him..      DENVER  —   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday called retired Marine Gen. John Allen a “failed general” after the highly respected military veteran delivered a forceful endorsement of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, earlier this week. “They had a general named John Allen, and he  —   I never met him,” Trump said during a campaign rally. ”And he got up and he started talking about Trump, Trump, Trump. Never met him. And you know who he is? He’s a failed general.”      Retired Gen. John Allen’s speech at the Democratic convention called for Hillary Clinton to be the next commander in chief. The crowd replied with loud chants. (The Washington Post)   Allen is a retired   general who served as commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. He was President Obama’s top choice to oversee U. S. and NATO operations in Europe, but instead he retired to assist his wife with chronic health issues. He came out of retirement in 2014 when the president named him Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State in 2014, a position he held for a year. “He was the general fighting ISIS. I would say he hasn’t done so well, right? Not so well,” Trump added, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group. Trump has regularly faulted the foreign policy establishment for failing to contain the Islamic State. He has also dismissed foreign policy experts on the campaign trail, particularly those who have criticized him, knocking their failure to produce solutions to ongoing ethnic and religious conflicts in the Middle East. Trump’s pitch to supporters on foreign policy rests on his “America First” motto, which has vacillated between contradictory promises to “bomb the     out of ISIS” and calls for a contracted American presence abroad.

(Daniel   News)  Allen indirectly attacked Trump during a speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, assailing the Republican candidate’s support for waterboarding, for which Trump has regularly spoken in favor. Allen also criticized Trump’s approach to international relations. “With her as our commander in chief, our international relations will not be reduced to a business transaction,” Allen said, speaking to Clinton’s foreign policy credentials. “I also know that our armed forces will not become an instrument of torture, and they will not be engaged in murder or carry out other illegal activities.” Trump’s attack Friday evening capped a   tirade against Clinton and several individuals who spoke at the Democratic National Convention this week. He also criticized Allen on Twitter Friday morning: “General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS.

The New Jersey governor, who was photographed in   at last week’s Notre     in Philadelphia, said that the candies come    —   with the bag in the box  —   and that he was simply putting them all into the sturdier vessel for convenience. “There’s a bag inside the box, you dope!” he told   Craig Carton and Boomer Esiason on their WFAN   show Wednesday. “It’s easier to hold the box than it is to hold the bag. ” Pressed by the hosts on why he wouldn’t just eat the M&M’s out of the bag, the former Republican presidential candidate said, “Because the bag is flimsy. ” He went on to detail his M&  strategy. “You get the box.

"Sweden decides it’s not so easy to give up nuclear power.  Nuclear power has been falling out of favor in Europe ever since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Italy has closed all its reactors. Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland are in the midst of retiring their fleets. Even France, which gets 77 percent of its electricity from nuclear, has been discussing a partial phaseout.    Yet for a continent that prides itself on being a leader on global warming, shutting down a major source of reliable,   electricity isn’t always easy. And Sweden is a great case study here. Until recently, Sweden’s nuclear reactors  —   which provide 40 percent of the nation’s electricity  —   were on track to close prematurely in the coming years, as government policies favored renewables. But last week, the country switched course. Under a new agreement, Sweden will get rid of a key tax that had been hurting nuclear, allowing existing reactors to keep running for longer. The country’s utilities will also now be permitted to build up to 10 new reactors to replace those scheduled to retire. (Though whether they actually do is an open question.) Officially, Sweden still has a goal of moving to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. But this new policy is, effectively, a backstop. If it turns out to be much harder than expected to power the entire country with wind, hydro, and solar alone  —   as some experts think it could be  —   then nuclear power will remain a ready option.    Why Sweden’s nuclear reactors were in trouble A quick bit of history: After the OPEC oil crises in the 1970s, Sweden went on a   spree to cut its fossil fuel dependence. This was one of the fastest feats of decarbonization the world has ever seen, along with France’s nuclear buildout. Here’s a list of the country’s nine current reactors, sited at three locations:               Nuclear power remains controversial  —   the country has been debating phaseouts since 1980  —   but it does provide real benefits to Sweden’s grid. These nine reactors supply 40 percent of the country’s electricity (hydropower provides another 50 percent, with the rest from wind and fossil fuels). Sweden now has one of the   grids on the planet. And the nation exports surplus electricity to its neighbors, particularly Finland. But in recent years, Sweden’s nuclear reactors have become starkly unprofitable. On June 10, it cost 3. 8 cents per   (kWh) to operate these reactors, on average. But operators only received around 2. 6   for their nuclear electricity.    Why the shortfall? Operating costs have increased in recent years, not least because plants have been required to adopt more stringent safety requirements after the 2011 Fukushima meltdown in Japan. At the same time, electricity prices have plummeted, partly due to economic malaise in Europe and partly due to subsidies that have made wind power artificially cheap in the Nordic power markets. There’s also a third reason: Ever since 2000, Sweden has levied a tax on nuclear power that recently got ratcheted up to nearly 1 cent per kWh. This tax helped raise revenue for renewable investments, reaping $484 million last year. But it was also driving nuclear out of business. Vattenfall, the company that operates seven of these reactors, warned that unless the tax was modified, most of the country’s nuclear power would be shut down by 2020, well ahead of schedule. That looming shutdown posed a dilemma. Many greens wanted to keep the tax, phase out Sweden’s nuclear fleet, and replace that power with wind and solar. But this was looking quite challenging to pull off in practice.    One key difficulty is that nuclear power plants run around the clock, whereas wind power is much more variable (operating at capacity around 30 percent of the time). One   study found that to replace 9, 000 megawatts of nuclear capacity, Sweden would have to build more than 22, 000 megawatts of wind capacity, plus about 8, 600 megawatts’ worth of gas turbines for backup power. By some estimates, building that much wind and gas would cost twice as much as simply keeping the existing reactors open for their remaining life spans. There’s also the question of what to do during Sweden’s winter, when electricity demand for heating soars but wind turbines often shut down due to extreme cold (and solar output drops sharply). A 2015 study in Energy Policy found that a premature shutdown would raise Sweden’s system costs ”disproportionately.” Another study in The European Physical Journal Plus found that replacing the entire nuclear fleet with wind and gas would cause Sweden’s electricity CO2 emissions to double. Swedish industry groups  —   heavy electricity users like Volvo or steelmaker SSAB  —   lobbied to save the reactors. How Sweden’s reactors got a second chance             Ultimately, the prospect of a premature shutdown seemed too daunting. Last Friday, Sweden’s governing Social Democrats and Greens reached a deal with the opposition to scrap the tax on nuclear power over the next two years, giving the existing reactors some room to avoid early closure. They also agreed to permit utilities to build up to 10 reactors at existing sites to replace the ones coming offline in the coming decade. Shortly after the agreement, Vattenfall approved safety upgrades at the three reactors at Forsmark, enabling the plants to continue operating well past 2020. The government still has a goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2040, but the agreement states this doesn’t necessarily rule out nuclear: ”This is a goal, not a   date that would prohibit nuclear power, and it does not mean either the end a closure of nuclear power.” According to the Financial Times, Energy Minister Ibrahim Baylan said of the deal: ”This is a traditional Swedish compromise.”    There’s still no guarantee that Sweden’s utilities will actually build new nuclear plants. These plants remain extremely costly to construct. Next door in Finland, the French state company Areva is building a   reactor now estimated to cost some $9. 5 billion  —   three times the original price, thanks to delays and overruns. More recently (and controversially) a Finnish consortium decided to partner with Russia’s Rosatom to build a separate reactor in Pyhäjoki in the hopes of lowering costs. It’s unclear what direction Sweden might go for new plants, but it can’t move forward unless the economics work out. The government isn’t offering subsidies for new builds, and wholesale prices are extraordinarily low right now. So some analysts are skeptical that we’ll see a future boom. In any case, it could be interesting to compare Sweden with Germany in the coming years. Germany, as part of its Energiewende plan to tackle global warming, is hoping to get 80 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050 (it’s at 31 percent now). Making this task tougher, the country is attempting this while retiring its unpopular nuclear fleet. You can read about some of Germany’s challenges here. There’s endless debate among energy wonks over whether it’s really feasible to power an entire grid with renewables alone. Germany is betting it (mostly) is. Sweden now appears to be hedging. Further reading:    Note that some US states  —   like California and Illinois  —   are seeing their own debates on whether to save nuclear reactors that are scheduled to shut down prematurely. Amy Harder has a good state of play here.    Sweden also had an interesting strategy for managing its nuclear waste. Rather than having the government decide unilaterally on a site for   geological storage (as the US Congress tried with Yucca Mountain in Nevada) policymakers drew up a list of potential sites and then consulted closely with local residents. The two finalist communities ended up competing against each other to host the waste site (which would mean jobs, money, and so on). The Energy Department has suggested a similar approach here.

"2 winners and 3 losers from the Univision Democratic debate.  It was only three days since the last Democratic debate, but Wednesday night’s showdown in Miami might as well have been a whole new race.    Since debating in Flint on Sunday night, Bernie Sanders had scored an upset victory in Michigan  —   a surprise win that’s put Hillary Clinton on the defensive while emboldening Sanders. Clinton, addressing the results directly, noted that she won more votes and more delegates on Tuesday (thanks to her big win in Mississippi) even as she and Sanders split the states. It was a confident and accurate portrayal of the state of the race. But her words and actions on the debate stage betrayed a much more profound insecurity. While Sunday night she seemed confident in a message that she was sure  —   based on extensive polling  —   would deliver a clear Michigan victory on March 8, followed by clear Illinois and Ohio victories on March 15, by Wednesday night she seemed profoundly uncertain of where she stood.    Technical glitches and a shaky command of debate management from a television crew that hasn’t been involved in earlier debates this cycle further added to the unsettled atmosphere, as did a rowdy and vocal crowd.    The overall effect was a debate that was not itself a transformative moment in the campaign so much as a signifier of how the campaign has been transformed once again. Clinton still holds a very solid lead, and all signs point to her winning. But nobody  —   including Clinton herself  —   is certain of how solid those signs are, and for now she’s watching her back quite nervously. Here are a few people who benefited and suffered from the fog.    Winner: Bernie Sanders In part, Sanders simply benefited from good fortune. All three of the moderators were more focused on Clinton’s weaknesses than Sanders’s, and set the tone for a debate that overwhelmingly put Clinton on the defensive. The only really tough question Sanders got came very late in the debate and on an issue  —   his past praise of Fidel Castro and Daniel Ortega  —   that Democratic primary voters probably don’t care about. Still, despite a favorable landscape, Sanders executed cleanly, crisply, and clearly. He delivered multiple red meat lines that attracted thunderous applause from the audience. Perhaps most of all, Sanders effectively pulled off the central rhetorical trick of his campaign: repeatedly making policy commitments that are well to the left of the Obama administration while downplaying the idea of a sharp break between himself and the popular incumbent president.    In Clinton’s best debates, she wields President Obama as an effective human shield, forcing Sanders to tone down his fiery condemnations of Washington corruption and throwing him off his message. Wednesday night, he didn’t have that problem. He slammed Clinton on her speaking fees, where she can’t use Obama as a shield, and deftly made a calculated break with Obama on deportations. Winner: Republicans Two days ago, I expected Hillary Clinton to win Michigan handily and then take advantage of the Univision debate to begin pivoting to the center and focusing the bulk of her energy on attacking the GOP field. Tonight should have been an opportunity to pin Donald Trump down to his extreme views, to elevate the national profile of some of Ted Cruz’s more   positions, and to start questioning the image of John Kasich as a moderate. Instead, Clinton narrowly lost Michigan and found herself bogged down in a real dogfight of a debate. Both candidates directed the vast majority of their fire at each other, generating a somewhat exaggerated view of the differences between them and forgoing an opportunity to drive home an   message. And the back and forth between Clinton and Sanders largely consisted of a relentless leftward march on every issue under the sun. Voters alarmed by the state of the Republican field but concerned that Democrats would indulge in overtaxation and be too relaxed about government spending, too soft on crime or too weak on national security, heard absolutely nothing reassuring Wednesday night. Sanders drove home his   message, and Clinton generally found herself tapping gingerly to the left rather than standing her ground. Loser: Hillary Clinton From the first day of the 2016 campaign right through to today, Clinton has been the favorite to win the nomination. She has had her stumbles and Sanders has had his victories, but she remains the frontrunner, and that hasn’t changed. But one of her core objectives throughout this primary has been not just to win, but to win without letting herself get dragged into   positions that will complicate her task in the general election.    Until tonight, she’d done a pretty good job of it. But when hit by waves of questions that were less about comprehensive immigration reform than about enforcement of existing immigration law, she made a series of commitments that go well beyond the existing Democratic Party consensus. Clinton indicated that she wouldn’t deport children, and maybe wouldn’t deport anyone at all as long as they haven’t violated   laws. She even went so far as to suggest she will try to help people who’ve already been deported come back to the United States. The narrow political calculation here is clear enough  —   Clinton needs nonwhite voters to win the primary, and most general election voters probably don’t care too much about this. But the net effect is to dull the sense that Donald Trump has an extreme position on immigration by countering ”deport everyone” with ”deport almost nobody.” Video: The audience booed for eight straight seconds when Hillary Clinton was asked about Benghazi    Loser: Univision This debate was a mess, starting with the fact that Sanders’s microphone didn’t work at the beginning through to disastrous audio mixing on the simultaneous translation that often left neither the Spanish nor English audible. But the problems went well beyond technical issues. The moderators opened the debate with two process questions in a row, and repeatedly went back to the well of faux hardball questions rather than illuminating ones. Not all the questions were bad, though, and the debate featured many intriguing exchanges. Yet each time an argument was getting good, the moderators would butt in to declare that time was up and we needed to move on to a different subject.    Given the    nature of the debate, there was simply no need for this. Disagreements between Clinton and Sanders over the wisdom of   health care, over the merits of the 2007 immigration reform bill, over the   Bank, and a   other issues ended up being cut short in favor of pivots to   questions about email servers or Benghazi. The result was, on most issues, something more like a    display of talking points than a real debate. Loser: Voters who care about immigration Immigration policy hasn’t been central to the 2016 Democratic campaign, and a debate   by Univision was a perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the topic and get a clearer view of where the candidates stand. As you might expect, we got quite a few questions on immigration. But those questions produced surprisingly little actual clarity on the policy issues or the choices facing the candidates. Clinton and Sanders, for example, rehearsed a   dialogue in which she slams him for having opposed the bipartisan 2007 immigration reform bill, after which Sanders explains he opposed it because it expanded guest worker programs that he regards as ”akin to slavery.” Does that mean Sanders wants to eliminate these programs? Given that the US has several different classes of   visas, which ones specifically does he have a problem with? Does Clinton agree with his criticisms of them, even if they reached different conclusions about the merits of the 2007 law? Do the candidates think the current level of immigration to the United States is appropriate? Too high? Too low? What do they make of the rising   sentiment in the Republican Party, and how does that change their thinking about the path forward for legislation? These weedsier questions about immigration are unlikely to be aired in any other forum, and it would have been great to take the time to delve into them rather than spending so much time rehashing questions that have been debated time and again.

Of all the possible reactions to the news that Donald Trump reported a loss of nearly $1 billion to the IRS in 1995, surely the oddest is the one from Trump surrogates Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, who said it goes to show that Trump is a business “genius. ”     The truth is that it doesn’t take a genius to lose a billion bucks. Nor does it take a genius to do what the New York Times suggested Trump did and use a single year’s worth of bad business moves to wipe out more than a decade in taxes. There are a lot of complicated accounting shenanigans involved in commercial real estate taxation, but the particular move the Times is suggesting is very simple.  It’s just not one ordinary   families can take advantage of.  If ordinary Americans take a bath on a bad real estate investment  —   as happened to millions of Americans during the housing crash of  ’09  —   but are lucky enough not to lose their job to boot, then they still have to pay taxes on their income. They can’t say the real estate loss “cancels out” the money they made at work. Not because they’re not geniuses, but because it’s illegal.     But if you’re rich enough to own lots of real estate and not just the house you live in, then you’re in luck. Investment losses now offset other forms of income  —   not just in the year when the losses happened, but in future and even past years.     You don’t need to be smart to take advantage of this provision of tax law; you just need to be rich.  Net operating loss carryforward, explained If you run a business, you hope it will be profitable.     But no business is profitable all the time. If you make a bunch of money in the spring but then lose money in the fall, those fall losses will offset your spring profits and reduce your tax bill. By the same token, if you lose money in 1997 but are profitable in 1998, the tax code lets you “carry forward” that 1997 operating loss to offset your 1998 profits. In effect, you get to pay taxes on your business’s average profitability over time to take into account the fact that you can’t pay less than zero tax during unprofitable years. Depending on whether you are shifting the loss forward or backward in time, this is called either net operating loss carryforward or carryback.  It’s a fairly reasonable principle, though it is worth noting that the tax code’s rules around it are quite generous. A net operating loss can carry backward for up to three years, wiping out taxes already paid, and can be carried forward for up to 15 years. That gives business proprietors a lot of flexibility to manage their taxes in a maximally favorable way. You could imagine a rule that just automatically averaged business profit and loss over some fixed time period rather than letting business owners pick and choose.    Normal people can’t do this The key thing, however, is that while carrying losses forward and back is an entirely standard practice for a business owner, if you’re not a business owner, you can’t do this.  Back during the financial crisis and the Great Recession, for example, tens of millions of Americans saw the value of their real estate assets fall. For many homeowners, it was simply a paper loss  —   your house was now worth less than what you paid for it. And for the lucky among us, it was a paper loss that went away as the real estate market improved in subsequent years. But millions of Americans ended up realizing actual monetary losses through foreclosures, short sales, or other hardships.  These kinds of real estate losses do not generate tax deductions that can be carried forward and backward to offset taxes owed during happier times.  Here’s where Trump differs from the typical   American. Buying a house that you live in isn’t a business, so you can’t benefit from special tax provisions aimed at business proprietors. To be able to ride the ups and downs of the real estate market in a   way, you need to own a lot of real estate.  Trump was able to put himself in a position to own a lot of real estate because his dad helped him out with a $14 million loan in the 1970s  —   worth more than $30 million in today’s money  —   which is obviously not something most people could do.  All of which is to say that you don’t need to be a genius to pull off Trump’s tax shenanigans  —   you just need a rich father.  ",-1.0

"Don’t avoid politics this holiday season. Use these 5 tips for productive conversations..  Here’s a question that seems particularly relevant as we head into holiday season 2016: In the wake of such a vituperative election, how do you possibly discuss politics with loved ones you might disagree with on just about everything, without wanting to kill each other?    I’ll be the first to admit there’s no easy answer. I recently wrote a whole piece on why progressives should work harder to express their values to folks in rural areas, without ever addressing the question of how to do that. Many of us are just giving up. In lots of families with political divides, politics might come up less and less. It’s too easy to get into a bitter fight, one that imperils loving relationships. Central to my argument in that earlier piece, though, is the idea that progressive values are worth standing up for  —   and that requires some degree of proselytizing to those who aren’t yet believers. Doing so is going to require conversation, though don’t worry. The holidays are here, and everything is better with a little pie and being face to face, instead of online. So here are five tips for having those conversations. Let me preface this by saying that these are all strategies that have worked for me  —   they either were ways people convinced me of progressive values when I was closer to the religious conservative end of the political spectrum, or they’re ways I’ve found of keeping these conversations productive but undramatic with friends and family back home.    Maybe they won’t work for you. That’s okay. They’re just a starting point; you’ll have a better idea of how to talk with your own friends and family than I will. Consider these general guidelines to get started, and take or leave them as you will  —   and if you’re a conservative (who does or doesn’t support Trump) all of these tips are general enough to work in either direction.    1) Tell a story. Don’t offer an argument.            Earlier this year, when talking with me about how Star Trek: The Next Generation helped him rethink many of the positions he held on various issues, author Reza Aslan told me he thinks storytelling is the strongest method we have for convincing other people of what we think is right. He said: I never get tired of reminding people that data does not change minds. You can be given poll after poll after poll, survey after survey after survey, challenging your view on something, and it doesn’t matter. What changes your mind is relationships and storytelling. They work on a completely different part of you. They’re dealing with your emotions, rather than your reason.    There’s a reason most religions are founded atop storytelling: It’s a great way to talk about what we do and don’t value. Telling a story and building relationships mean, necessarily, engaging with the human side of an issue. It’s a good way to remove some of the stress of talking about politics, too. Issues become more real when there are human faces attached to them. When I was a religious conservative, a big part of my belief system was centered on abortion. Since I’m adopted  —   and could, I thought, have been aborted  —   it was a big hurdle for me to get over, even as my values were more progressive than my peers on issues like LGBTQ rights and the environment. But what changed my mind was talking with friends who had made the choice to end pregnancies, for a variety of reasons. It was about being convinced not by an argument, but by people I knew and loved and cared about.    Obviously, you won’t be able to put a human face on every single issue, but when you’re talking about an idea as big as “I fear Donald Trump will be a bad president,”  then you should be able to find somewhere to start.  Tell the story of a friend or family member whose life will be affected by a Trump presidency. Start there, and stay there as long as possible. 2) Keep things sincere, as much as possible             You’ll know the person you’re talking to better than I will. With someone you know really well, shared jokes or humor can be a great way to break the ice and keep tension from spilling over. But it’s way too easy for sarcasm, say, to be misinterpreted and come off as condescending. I spent a lot of time in college  —   when I was going through my political evolution  —   feeling like my girlfriend at the time (now my wife) was making fun of me when she mocked political positions I held deeply, even if she had no idea of what she was doing. It’s way, way too easy for us to come to think of our political positions as extensions of ourselves. That’s probably not healthy in the long run, but it’s something to keep in mind as an issue that has to be worked around. The way I’ve found to be most effective is sincerity. Say the things you mean, with as much compassion as you can muster. Clear the air before injecting more smoke into it. 3) Really listen to what’s going on  —   not what you assume is going on             A mentor of mine always said that when you’re getting notes on a piece you’ve written, it’s important to take a moment to figure out not how to deal with the note, but what’s motivating it.     Sometimes a note can seem overwhelming, until you realize that what it’s talking about is easily fixed earlier in the piece, when, say, clarification of a point will clear everything up more easily. What’s important is to work through your own reactions to the note  —   be they psychological or emotional  —   so you can better figure out what’s driving that point. Something similar is important when talking to people with whom you disagree on an issue. Because all of us live in geographical and social media bubbles, it’s really easy to draw conclusions about what we think of people who live in different bubbles, and those conclusions can be inaccurate. To return to my own thoughts around abortion, it took having friends who were willing to acknowledge my own ties to the issue, who could talk to me about how it was okay to feel how I felt, but who also weren’t willing to budge on their own position on abortion because of something that might have happened to me in the past (but didn’t). This is painstaking, sometimes enervating work. These issues are already heated in our national discourse, and it’s easy to jump to, “That’s a horrible thing to say!” because, hey, sometimes people say horrible things. But trying to find the emotions and thought processes lying underneath those horrible things is almost always the strongest way to find common ground and build from there. 4) Try not to use online shorthand (like “privilege”) for broad, systemic problems. Talk about the problems themselves instead.            Of late, I’ve found that the concept of, say, privilege sets off alarm bells in my conservative friends. It’s not that they don’t get the concept  —   they can accept that, say, life in the United States is easier for a generic straight white male than for a generic anybody else. It’s that it can be tough to leap from “I agree this is true in general” to “I agree this is true for me. ” Online progressive discourse is soaked in academic language, and I think that’s cool and even useful when most everybody knows what those terms mean. But that academic language hasn’t made the leap offline in a way that allows for easy discussion in real, physical spaces.     “Racist” means very different things to people who think the word describes systemic oppression in the US and those who think the word describes a specific kind of person, one who openly expresses prejudice and bias against those of other races.  Think of the idea that white people can’t experience racism. It’s true if you think about how American society is systemically biased in favor of white people in general. It’s less true if you think simply about prejudice, because anybody can be prejudiced against anybody for a wide variety of reasons. And nearly everybody has experienced some form of prejudice directed against them  —   and has pain connected to that. Invalidating that pain is a good way to create a rift. Thus, it’s important for everybody to be speaking the same language. And sometimes that means not taking the linguistic shortcuts progressives use for discussion online. That doesn’t mean abandoning social justice issues, but it does mean, sometimes, backing up and using techniques from steps one through three to talk about why those issues are important. 5) Be sure you’re in the right mental place to talk about this stuff            Don’t neglect the fact that these topics are tough. They can cause strain on relationships, and strain on your mental  .  If you’re at Thanksgiving dinner and you’re not ready to talk about any of this because you’re still too emotionally raw, that’s totally fine. If you’re in a place where you’ll erupt in anger, that could poison relationships going forward. And if you’re in a place where you’ll fall into depression, that’s a problem too. All of us will hopefully have more time to talk about this stuff with those we love. If you believe in progressive values, it’s important to have those talks  —   but it’s also important to make sure you’re taking care of yourself so you can keep going.    The important thing is to reach out to your friends and family who feel differently from you and remind yourself that you’re all human beings. If that means, at this moment in time, letting a few snide quips about Obamacare or climate change slide, because you’re just not ready to talk about it, let that happen.  None of this is easy, and it’s all built atop relationships. Remember, always, that you’re one half of that relationship too, and compensate accordingly. ",-1.0
"Getting lost in space will soon be how you vacation. Later this month in Mojave, California, Virgin Galactic is preparing to roll out its new SpaceShipTwo, a vehicle the company hopes will one day take tourists to the edge of space. It comes roughly 15½ months since an earlier incarnation was destroyed in a test flight, killing one of the pilots. Despite the setback, the dream of sending tourists to the edge of space and beyond is still alive. Space tourism companies are employing designs including winged vehicles, vertical rockets with capsules and   balloons. A look at projects currently under development: The most prominent space tourism program, the commercial space line founded by   mogul Sir Richard Branson will use a winged rocket plane dubbed SpaceShipTwo, successor to SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 won the $10 million Ansari X Prize that was intended to spur the industry’s development. SpaceShipTwo is designed to be flown by two pilots and carry up to six passengers on a suborbital trajectory to altitudes above 62 miles (100 kilometers) an internationally recognized boundary of space. Like early U. S.   Virgin Galactic’s craft will be carried aloft by another aircraft, called WhiteKnightTwo, and released at about 50, 000 feet before its rocket engine is ignited for a supersonic thrill ride to the fringes of space and a view of the Earth far below. The space line says SpaceShipTwo’s cabin is roomy enough for passengers to float during a few minutes of weightlessness before beginning an unpowered glide to a runway landing. A key feature of the design is the   feathering system  —   a term derived from the feathers of a badminton projectile. Twin tails extending rearward from the tips of each wing rotate upward as a means to slow and stabilize SpaceShipTwo as it   the atmosphere. The “feathers” then rotate back to their normal position for the rest of the glide and landing. Virgin Galactic’s first SpaceShipTwo was destroyed on Oct. 31, 2014, when a   prematurely unlocked the feathers during a powered test flight and aerodynamic forces broke the craft apart. The   was killed but the pilot parachuted to safety. The company will roll out its new SpaceShipTwo later this month in Mojave, California, but the timeline for testing and commercial operation has not been released. Hundreds of people have put down deposits of $250, 000 for a chance to fly into space with Virgin Galactic, which plans to operate from Spaceport America in New Mexico. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin project is testing a   rocket topped by a   capsule for suborbital hops. Like astronaut Alan Shepard’s pioneering 1961 flight during Project Mercury, the capsule separates from the booster rocket and descends beneath parachutes without going into orbit around the Earth. The unconventional twist is reusability. Blue Origin recently conducted a test launch from Texas in which the rocket dubbed New Shepard performed a vertical landing, slowing its descent by relighting its engine as it fell back to Earth. In January, the company launched the same rocket and it again landed intact. Blue Origin says that during flights, passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness after the capsule separates from the booster. Passengers will be able to leave their seats and float about the capsule before a signal tells them to be reseated for landing. The company has chosen Florida for its base of operations. Details of space tourism operations have not been released. The company has spent years developing a rocket plane named Lynx that is intended to be capable of making multiple flights each day with a pilot and one passenger aboard. Unlike Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, the Lynx will take off under its own power from a runway, climb toward space and then glide back to a runway landing. XCOR also plans flights surpassing an altitude of 62 miles. In December, the company said it reached a milestone in development of the Lynx propulsion system by successfully using waste heat to drive essential engine parts, eliminating the need for large and heavy tanks of compressed gas. XCOR, now headquartered in Midland, Texas, also reported progress late last year in completing structural components of its first Lynx as well as a flight simulator system for pilot training. The company says it has more than 350 clients. The price of booking a seat rose from $100, 000 to $150, 000 on Jan. 1, but the company has not said when flights will begin. “The fact is that we are in a process in which you just can’t rush things,” Lynx test pilot Harry van Hulten said in a press release last fall. The Arizona company plans to loft passengers to altitudes above 100, 000 feet in a capsule suspended below a “parawing” and a helium balloon. The trip some 19 miles high would be to “near space” but would give a substantial view of the Earth far below while avoiding the stress of G forces endured during rocket flight. Compared to flights on   space tourism vehicles offering a few minutes at the top of a suborbital trajectory, World View envisions spending two hours at the maximum altitude, with amenities such as a lavatory. The   crew then begins the landing process by venting helium until the capsule descends to 50, 000 feet. The balloon is then released and the parawing allows the capsule to glide to a landing spot. The company announced last month that it plans to conduct launches from Spaceport Tucson.",1.0

"A 747 Set a New Record for Crossing the Atlantic. Here's a good piece of trivia for you: What's the fastest commercial airliner in operation? As of Sunday, the answer might be ""the Boeing 747""—not bad for an airliner that first entered service 50 years ago. On Saturday evening at 6:47 pm ET, British Airways 747-400, tail number G-CIVP, took off from John F. Kennedy (JFK) airport in New York. It landed at London's Heathrow Airport (LHR) at 4:43 am local time—a crossing time of just 4 hours and 56 minutes, and a new record for subsonic aircraft. This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast. Of course, the venerable jumbo had some help. Neither Boeing nor BA have rolled out a surprise engine upgrade, but Storm Ciara—a weather disturbance currently rearranging British landscapes—gave the plane a helping hand with 200+ mph (320+ kmh) tailwinds. G-CIVP set a peak ground speed of 825 mph (1,327 kmh), although its peak airspeed remained subsonic at around Mach 0.85. Virgin Atlantic actually had two of its planes reach Heathrow in under five hours from JFK on Saturday night, each an Airbus A350-1000. However, these planes achieved flight times of 4 hours and 57 minutes and 4 hours and 59 minutes, which at least allowed Virgin Atlantic to tease on Twitter that it accomplished the feat on much less fuel. Both times are still significantly faster than the previous best subsonic Atlantic crossing, set by a Norwegian airliner that took 5 hours and 13 minutes. None of these times are close to those achieved by Concorde, a supersonic commercial airliner operated by BA and Air France from 1976 until 2003. In 1996, a BA Concorde flew the same JFK-LHR route in just 2 hours and 52 minutes, cruising at Mach 2. And even that's not the fastest transatlantic crossing by an air-breathing aircraft that we know of. In 1974, an SR-71 flew between the two cities in a mere 1 hour and 54 minutes, although pedants might disqualify it, as it did not take off from JFK nor land at Heathrow.

"President Obama’s farewell address: start time, how to watch, and what to expect.  Barack Obama’s presidency will soon come to an end, and he will deliver a farewell address to the nation tonight at 9 pm Eastern in Chicago. The speech will air on most major broadcast networks, and a live stream is embedded above.    The address comes at a tense and uncertain moment in American politics. Donald Trump, whom Obama has called “unfit to serve,” is preparing to take the office. Trump has pledged to deport many more unauthorized immigrants, sharply limit Muslim immigration, repeal Obamacare, roll back climate change regulations, and build up the US’s nuclear weapons arsenal. Overall, Trump plans to try to erase much of the legacy that Obama thought he would leave the country.  Oratory has always held a special importance to Obama’s story, since he first rose to national prominence because of a speech  —   his famous 2004 Democratic convention keynote address. His final major speech, therefore, is sure to be closely watched  —   particularly because the most famous presidential farewell addresses in history have given warnings to the American people. The history of the farewell address The tradition of the presidential farewell address technically dates back to George Washington, who published the first and most famous such address (in text form) in September 1796. The tradition fell out of fashion for some time, but with the dawn of mass communication technology in the   century, it came back into vogue, and since then, every president who’s served two full terms in office has delivered one.    Most farewell addresses are forgettable. They’re a time for presidents to brag about their accomplishments, say how much they’ve loved serving the country, and give a final goodbye on their way out. Few remember, for instance, George W. Bush’s farewell reflections on the war on terror or Bill Clinton’s argument for fiscal responsibility.    But others have stood the test of time, and this is primarily because they’ve given warnings that are deemed by later generations as prophetic. Indeed, the first and most famous presidential farewell address, delivered by George Washington, was framed as a series of explicit warnings to the young nation from “a parting friend. ” Washington cautioned America about the dangers of sectionalism, of overzealous partisanship, and of permanent foreign alliances. Though much of the address could be read as a criticism of the Jeffersonian Republicans, it was stated in terms of broad principles rather than specific grievances, and has therefore survived.     The second most famous farewell address was delivered by Dwight Eisenhower in 1961, and it had a similarly cautionary tone. The former general warned of that the new “conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry”  —   which he dubbed “the   complex”  —   could pose grave dangers to American liberties and US democracy.  What to expect from President Obama’s farewell address The big question, then, is whether President Obama will seek to focus on what he’s achieved and take a   optimistic view of where the country is headed  —   or whether he will give some darker warnings to the American people. It is highly unlikely that Obama will explicitly criticize Donald Trump. Throughout the transition, Obama has attempted to maintain good relations with the incoming president, and to make clear that he respects the electoral process. Plus, he’s temperamentally an optimist, and frequently argues that the “arc of history” may be long but it “bends toward justice. ” So don’t expect him to go out with a bombastic and condemnatory piece of oratory  —   even if he does still think, as he said in August, that Trump lacks the “basic knowledge,” “basic decency,” “judgment,” and “temperament” necessary for the presidency.    Still, Barack Obama is a president who thinks quite a lot about his place in history and how he will be remembered. And for particularly important addresses, Obama has often taken a very   role in speechwriting. “There are certain speeches that I have to write myself,” Obama told journalist Michael Lewis in 2012. “There are times when I’ve got to capture what the essence of the thing is. ” So it seems unlikely that he will pass up this unique moment to make a very personal statement on this moment in American politics. For an example of how he might handle the speech, check out the remarks the president gave shortly after Trump won, or watch Michelle Obama’s final speech as first lady. Both pointedly argued for the importance of inclusion and diversity, in a way that seemed pointedly aimed at Trump. And both argued that young people must remain engaged in politics going forward rather than getting disillusioned. Still, the moment may call for something more.

"Some gun owners are disturbed by the Philando Castile verdict. The NRA is silent..      Amid the national fury over the death of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in July  —   a shooting made more horrific by his girlfriend’s Facebook Live broadcast of his final moments  —   some condemned the National Rifle Association’s near silence on the matter. The organization had been quick to defend other gun owners who made national news. Castile had a valid permit for his firearm, reportedly told the officer about it to avoid a confrontation, and was fatally shot anyway after being told to hand over his license. So some NRA members were furious when the organization released a tepid statement, more than a day after the shooting, that merely called it “troublesome” and promised that “the NRA will have more to say once all the facts are known. ” A year later, the investigation is over and many more facts are known. Police recordings and court records confirmed initial reports that Castile had tried to defuse the situation, assuring the officer that he wasn’t reaching for his weapon. On Friday, a jury acquitted the officer, Jeronimo Yanez, of manslaughter. So, some gun rights advocates are once again furious. And the NRA still has nothing to say.   [The NRA’s internal split over Philando Castile]   The Washington Post couldn’t find any statement from the organization about the verdict in Castile’s case, and the organization did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. Phillip Smith, who leads the National African American Gun Association, said he hasn’t seen any NRA statements since July. “And I’ve been reading pretty diligently,” he said. “It troubles me tremendously when I see a young man following the rules, doing what he’s supposed to be doing, and there’s still no accountability from a legal perspective. ” The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus told the Associated Press that the jury had effectively told African Americans that “the Second Amendment does not apply to them. ” A writer for Slate also received no response from the NRA when he wrote about the officer’s acquittal, prompting him to write: “If Castile had been white instead of black, the NRA would have been rallying behind him and his family since the moment of his death, and fundraising off his memory for the rest of time. ”   [Minn. officer acquitted in shooting of Philando Castile during traffic stop, dismissed from police force]   A year ago, the NRA’s own members were calling out the organization, as Brian Fung wrote for The Post. “What do I pay fees for if you do not represent gun owners and our rights?” one wrote on the group’s Facebook page. As described in a criminal complaint from Yanez’s trial, the first moments of Castile’s traffic stop ring true to Smith’s experience as a black gun owner. “Black men are feared in this country,” he said. “They put their hands on their gun and say, ‘Don’t make any sudden movements.’ ” Smith said he knows the unspoken rules of any police encounter  —   rules that go beyond laws and constitutional rights. “Definitely don’t move at all,” he said, keep your hands on the steering wheel, “take baby steps with the officer until they’re comfortable. ” In Castile’s case, according to the complaint, he told Yanez, “I’m not pulling it out”  —   a few seconds before the officer drew his own gun and killed Castile. “We should all carry a gun now,” Smith said. “We all have that right. We’re not going to let a rogue officer or a rogue legal decision sway us. ” Anger about the officer’s acquittal has managed to unite critics from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. The National Review’s David French, for instance, once wrote that “it’s hard to recall a political movement built on more verifiable lies and misinformation than Black Lives Matter. ” But after the Yanez verdict, French’s opinion matched that of Black Lives Matter protesters. He wrote of the officer: “Whether he panicked because of race, simply because of the gun, or because of both, he still panicked, and he should have been held accountable. ” He added: “The jury’s verdict was a miscarriage of justice. ” And still, nothing from the normally vocal NRA, which once released a statement two days after a mass shooting in Orlando: “Destroy radical Islam, not the right of   Americans to protect themselves. ”   The 2nd Amendment was GROSSLY violated in this #PhilandoCastile. Where are you NRA? These ppl could care less about the constitution  —   Tariq Nasheed (@tariqnasheed) June 16, 2017   But nothing is clear cut when it comes to guns and race in the United States, said Nicholas Johnson, who lectures on both at Fordham Law School, wrote a book called “Negroes and the Gun,” and is a black gun owner. The NRA has championed black gun rights heroes before, Johnson notes  —   such as Otis McDonald, who fought Chicago’s handgun ban. In return, he said, the group was accused of exploiting civil rights issues. On the other hand, he said, gun owners were still “perceived to be kind of an odd minority” within the black community  —   not exactly a constituency worth angering police over. “Your political calculation, I think, at the NRA is: Okay, so we can come to the rhetorical aid of a moderately despised contingent of a minority that already doesn’t like us,” Johnson said. “What’s the upside?” More reading: The Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings in 2017 Philando Castile was an adored school cafeteria manager Minn. police officer who shot Philando Castile was model student, educator says  ",-0.5

"Why Democrats are excited about today’s votes on doomed gun control bills.  Gun control votes can often send Democrats running scared and divided, but today they stand united in the face of a strategic  —   if not legislative  —   win.    Early this evening, the Senate will go on the record on a measure instituting universal background checks for gun buyers and another measure allowing the FBI to veto gun purchases by people under investigation for ties to terrorism.   Related Here are the 4 gun control proposals the Senate is voting on today    Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy’s epic   filibuster last week represented a resounding tactical victory for Democrats who won the right to stage Senate floor votes on two gun control ideas the party had been pushing fruitlessly for months. Nobody expects either amendment to obtain the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. And even if the unexpected happens and some version of one of these ideas gets enough GOP support to pass, it would be dead on arrival in the House of Representatives.    Beyond that, these measures are exceptionally modest as a policy matter  —   steps that even in a best case scenario would do barely anything to reduce gun violence in the United States. These modest ideas poll well but are unlikely to be big practical political winners because gun rights proponents are much more politically active on gun issues than are proponents of gun control, who generally favor more regulation but do so in a   way.    Nonetheless, the very fact that we are having a political standoff over gun regulation this week is a substantial strategic victory for the Democrats  —   taking the politically dangerous events of the Pulse massacre in Orlando and at worst neutralizing them. Democrats have worried that terrorism will help Trump The possibility that terrorist attacks might shift the electoral terrain in Donald Trump’s favor has been one of Democrats’ biggest worries since he emerged as the presumptive nominee.    In a dream world, of course, Democrats would like to think that focusing voters’ attention on the prospect of national peril would lead them to reject an inexperienced and unqualified nominee. But many GOP elites had just such dreams last winter, only to see them shattered when the San Bernardino shootings only boosted the appeal of Trump’s xenophobia. More broadly, both experimental and   studies have tended to show that in the US and abroad, the major party with a more hawkish reputation usually benefits when international terror becomes a major concern. For instance, Michael Koch, Laron Williams, and Jason Smith studied how quickly various parliamentary governments lost their majority coalitions after transnational terrorist attacks in a 2012 paper. What they found was that   governments had an easier time holding on to power than   governments did. It seems that the left gets more blame for terrorist attacks that occur under their watch.    Then there’s evidence from Israel that indicates that terror helps the right at the ballot box. Claude Berrebi and Esteban Klor found that a terror attack in an Israeli locality shortly before the election causes, on average, ”an increase of 1. 35 percentage points on that locality’s support for the right bloc of political parties.” And Anna Getmansky and Thomas Zeitzoff found that after rockets are fired into areas of Israel, even if there are no casualties, support for   parties spikes in those areas by 2 to 6 percent. Shifting the argument to guns is a strategic win In that context, focusing the political argument on gun regulation rather than Omar Mateen’s admiration for ISIS or questions around Muslim immigration to the United States is a strategic win. Democrats may not win many votes with thin gruel,   gun control proposals, but they aren’t going to lose any. Last fall, by contrast, the American political system found itself gripped with vague fears about Syrian refugees that led to   refugee bans and congressional legislation that scared vulnerable Democrats as part of a larger cultural trend toward Islamophobia. That’s perilous political terrain for Democrats, and the basic facts of the Mateen case suggested the possibility that the conversation would shift back into that mode. A couple of    and    gun control bills that the NRA and the Republican Party will filibuster to death, by contrast, is very safe ground for Democrats. Something they can talk about until the next thing comes up and the news cycle shifts. Democrats are united, Republicans are divided Most of all, the gun bills represent common ground across the Democratic Party.    Obama supports them and so does everyone from Bernie Sanders to Elizabeth Warren to Joe Manchin. Hillary Clinton is comfortable running on them, and so are Democratic Senate challengers in New Hampshire and Ohio. Republicans, by contrast, are divided with   Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) defecting to the Democratic camp and the likes of Pat Toomey ( ) and Susan Collins ( ) at least trying to demonstrate openness to compromise. Trump himself, meanwhile, has thrown GOP messaging into chaos. He’s been trying to act like an orthodox NRA conservative on guns, but the debate has revealed that  —   surprise  —   he doesn’t really understand this issue. His instinct was to say that Orlando showed the country would have been better off if more Pulse clubgoers had been packing heat, a position so absurd that even the NRA  —   which does not condone gunplay under the influence of alcohol  —   condemned. Now Trump is   trying to say that he didn’t say what he clearly did say about wishing random clubgoers had opened fire in a crowded room after knocking back a few drinks. Meanwhile, Trump continues to fight with Republican congressional leaders over his proposed ban on Muslim immigration. This more than the specifics of the bills is the big political win for Democrats. Casual observers of the political scene see the Democrats responding to tragedy with a clear agenda, while Republicans are responding with infighting driven by the erratic and unpopular character at the top of their ticket. It’s not bad for a few days’ work, especially on an issue that’s supposed to be the other party’s strength.  How fast 4 different guns can shoot and reload    ",-1.0
"Better Call Saul Alignment Check: Episode 6, \""Bali Ha'i\"". Jimmy returns to the back burner this week, mostly serving as moral support for Kim as she’s faced with a big decision: a job offer from the firm she and Jimmy are opposing in the Sandpiper case. (Kim really has saved herself, simply by being an excellent, competent lawyer.) Rather than engaging in capers of his own, Jimmy serenades Kim with ""Bali Ha'i"" via voicemail, perhaps the most McGillian romantic gesture imaginable. And he’s there when Kim needs him to get a ""live one"" on the hook—a man hitting on her who they con into ""investing"" in a new business venture (essentially, online dating) in the name of… “Ice Station Zebra Associates.” The origins of Saul Goodman's favorite holding company—a romantically shared manipulation—is a nice touch, representative of the way everyone on Better Call Saul is relentlessly dragged toward the logical conclusions of their own best intentions. Jimmy’s caring impulse betrayed him with Chuck, and it might bite him in the ass with Kim, but it’s all leading him toward the same conclusion—something that’s exemplified by the episode’s cold open. In a sequence masterfully shot by director Michael Slovis, Jimmy wrestles with insomnia, tossing and turning in bed, playing soccer and basketball by himself, and generally goofing around, until he returns... to the pullout bed in the nail salon, where he finally falls asleep. It’s far less comfortable than his fancy new house, but when he’s alone in the middle of the night, Jimmy knows where home is. ",0.0
"Russia, with an eye on U.S., threatens to bomb Syrian cease-fire violators.   MOSCOW  —   Russia warned on Monday that it was prepared to act unilaterally in Syria against groups that it said were breaking the   there, injecting a volatile new element into a conflict that has been calmer in recent weeks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the country’s military was ready to strike as early as Tuesday against groups that it said were violating the   unless U. S. leaders agree to discuss a Russian proposal for how to maintain the peace. So far, Russian warplanes have been observing the   U. S. officials say.  [In the Syria chess game, did Putin outwit Obama?]  The ultimatum may be as much a negotiating gambit with the United States as it is a warning that Russia is about to act on the ground in Syria, from which it pulled a portion of its warplanes last week. The Russian military has sought close cooperation with the Pentagon in Syria; the Pentagon, angered by Russia’s actions both in Ukraine and in Syria, has held back. Secretary of State John F. Kerry is due to meet Thursday with Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss efforts to achieve peace in Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week that he would pull the bulk of Russia’s warplanes from Syria after their   deployment helped prop up Syrian President Bashar  . But as with other public announcements about Russian military deployments in recent years, the reality proved more complicated. Russia’s Defense Ministry later announced it was flying as many as 25 sorties a day to support the Syrian army’s efforts to retake Palmyra from the Islamic State. That is permitted under the terms of the   deal. Such a tempo would require a significant deployment to remain in place in Syria.  [Syria shows that Russia built an effective military. Now how will Putin use it?]  “We do not rule out the possibility that we will have to unilaterally use force to curb the actions of the rebels who fail to comply with the   arrangements,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier Monday that the action could come as quickly as Tuesday, should U. S. officials not respond to their proposals about how to address   violations. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was specifically concerned about groups that it says are allied with  ’s affiliate in Syria, Jabhat  . U. S. officials have complained that Russia and the Syrian government label all Assad opponents as Islamic State or   even if they are more moderate. The warning from Russia was a reminder of how tenuous the   remains, amid growing doubts that it can hold much longer. Observers say Assad forces have repeatedly violated the truce, including with barrel bombs Monday in several places around the country. Opposition groups, meanwhile, say they are unwilling to hold to the   if it simply freezes the Syrian government’s recent territorial gains without offering any chance of a   peace deal and political transition. “We agreed to have a special mechanism” to handle   violations, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “In general, it was established, but in reality it doesn’t work. ” She said the U. S. side had been slow to respond to Russian allegations of violations. A Pentagon spokesman said there was no such delay. “Whoever is making such statements must be misinformed, because these issues have been discussed at length already, and continue to be discussed, in a constructive manner,” Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for the U. S.  coalition in Iraq and Syria, said in an email. “We fully expect Russia to refrain from unilateral actions and respond to our   ” about how to put the truce agreement into effect, he said.

"Kaepernick’s symbolism misses the point.              “I think it’s a misunderstanding. ”     The Washington Post spoke to football fans at a preseason tailgate about the role of politics in football and this is what they said. (Dalton   Washington Post)   So answered San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick when asked what he thought about being booed for refusing to stand during the national anthem at last week’s preseason game against the San Diego Chargers. He was right. It was a misunderstanding. And that’s precisely the problem with symbols and symbolic gestures in the realm of political debate  —   they’re understood by different people in different ways, and not always in ways consistent with original intent. By choosing not to stand (he sat on the bench during the anthem for the Aug. 26 game against Green Bay and knelt during the anthem for the Sept. 1 game in San Diego) Kaepernick wants to say something about racial injustice. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told the NFL Network after the Packers game. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. ” Kaepernick evidently has some strong views on this subject, but what are they, exactly? Does he believe, say, that most Americans are racists? That most police officers target African Americans for harassment? That the United States as a whole deliberately and systematically persecutes African Americans? Somehow I doubt he would agree with any of these things without qualification  —   and yet they are all rational inferences from his refusal to honor the flag of a “country that oppresses black people and people of color. ” When pressed further to explain his views after the Chargers game, he wasn’t helpful. What was he trying to convey? “The message is that we have a lot of issues in this country that we need to deal with. We have a lot of people that are oppressed. We have a lot of people that aren’t treated equally, aren’t given equal opportunities. Police brutality is a huge thing that needs to be addressed. There are a lot of issues that need to be talked about, need to be brought to life, and we need to fix those. ” President Obama reinforced that message on Monday. “If nothing else,” the president said, “what he’s done is he’s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about. ” Reminding Americans that they need to “talk about” and “deal with” a problem that already consumes them is not, perhaps, the wisest of political exhortations. And in any case, one wonders what nation in the history of the world has not had dire “issues” that needed to be talked about and dealt with. Has there ever been a nation sufficiently   to merit Kaepernick’s reverence? What was the pop singer Beyoncé, for instance, trying to say in her music video for “Formation”? In the video, we see the singer in one scene sitting atop a New Orleans police vehicle submerged in water, and in another raising a middle finger to the camera; then we see a hooded black youth standing in front of a line of police officers with their hands up, and a wall bearing the graffito “stop shooting us. ” In one sense, her meaning seems obvious  —   she wants police officers to stop shooting black men without cause. But taken together, and without any interpretation to guide us, we might reasonably conclude that Beyoncé is denouncing police officers as a group  —   or the United States itself  —   as racist. Hence the pop singer’s remark to Elle magazine: “I’m an artist and I think the most powerful art is usually misunderstood. But anyone who perceives my message as   is completely mistaken. ” Or, going further back, what exactly did Sinead O’Connor mean, in her notorious 1992 stunt on “Saturday Night Live,” by ripping up a picture of Pope John Paul II and proclaiming, “Fight the real enemy”? And what did Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the Olympians who at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City raised fists at their awards ceremony, mean to communicate? There are answers to all these questions  —   in fact there are scores of answers to them, which is why the instigators of such symbolic stunts usually spend more energy explaining what they didn’t mean than what they did. They have strong views, and their views may deserve consideration, but their gestures do little but generate metaphorical “conversations” consisting chiefly of misunderstanding and acrimony. None of this is to suggest that symbolic acts are always worthless. The Old Testament prophets made some pretty bizarre symbolic statements about their governments, and they interpreted those statements in sharply controversial ways. When African Americans in Montgomery, Ala. refused to give up their seats on public buses, the aim was clear and their message peremptory: an end to segregation on buses and, by extension, all public places. When a young man stood in front of a column of tanks in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, he wasn’t simply or literally trying to stop the tanks from moving forward; he was saying that the protesters weren’t afraid of their government and that the desire for political freedom wouldn’t be vanquished by military force. These latter instances raise an important point about protests against entire societies. Rosa Parks and her allied nonconformists had themselves been treated abominably by their government. The protester at Tiananmen Square had neither notoriety nor influence; indeed his identity is still unknown. What Kaepernick, Beyoncé and the rest haven’t grasped is that the acquisition of fame and extreme wealth increases the need for lucidity in their political pronouncements. The likelihood is high that their complaints, however legitimate in the abstract, will be interpreted by the majority as the whiny ingratitude of rich kids. Even if Kaepernick’s refusal to stand has consequences for his career  —   even if, as Kareem   pointed out in a Post   defending the quarterback, his actions could “cost him millions in future endorsements and affect his value as a player”  —   that hardly compares to the risk of imprisonment and death. Famous athletes and entertainers may have legitimate concerns, and of course they have a right to be heard. But if they don’t take care to communicate with precision, they can’t expect to be interpreted in the way they would prefer.

"Now you can buy and sell junk on Facebook. Facebook has Craigslist in its cross hairs. Mark Zuckerberg’s social network on Monday launched “Marketplace,” a new tab that allows people to buy and sell local items with their phones  —   and keeps them glued to Facebook. Like Craigslist, Facebook’s new feature won’t facilitate payments or delivery of goods, and won’t take a cut from transactions  —   but it does come with a much more nifty user interface. By comparison, the   marketplaces of eBay and Amazon take a cut from each item sold. EBay shares were trading down on Monday afternoon by 1. 8 percent, to $32. 30, after tumbling earlier in the session by as much as 3. 5 percent. Amazon shares dipped $4. 31 to $833. 00.

"No one was held responsible for Freddie Gray’s death. Now the officers are getting cash..  In 2015, Freddie Gray died from a neck injury while in the custody of Baltimore police, and all of the officers involved in the arrest and charged with felonies related to his death have been acquitted.    Monday, two of them got more news: big checks. The Baltimore Sun reports that Alicia White and William Porter, two of the officers who were there the day Gray was placed in the back of a police van, where doctors believe his spine was severed, will receive a combined $167, 000 ($98, 855 to White and $70, 523 to Porter) in back pay. They’ve both been suspended without pay since May 1, 2015. Now that they’ve been found not guilty, the department’s policy entitles them to be compensated for all the time they would have been working. The two are just the latest officers involved in Gray’s death to receive back pay since it was determined that they were not criminally responsible. According to the Baltimore Sun, Caesar Goodson was paid $87, 705 in July. Brian Rice got $126, 917 earlier this month. Prosecutors failed to convince jurors that the officers had caused Gray’s death by failing to secure him in a seat belt in the back of the van.    Gray’s death caused protests and riots when it occurred, when Baltimore residents expressed frustration and dismay with what they said was ongoing police abuse in the city’s   communities. It’s even clearer now than after Freddie Gray’s death: The Baltimore Police Department is a disaster Between the time the officers were acquitted and Monday’s announcement about the backpay they’ll receive, a Department of Justice investigation confirmed that the Baltimore Police Department was doing everything protestors said and more. Vox’s German Lopez summarized the DOJ report’s nine most damning findings:  Baltimore police target black Americans, even when they’re totally innocent of any crimes;  Baltimore officers escalate typical policing situations into violence for no good reason;  Before Freddie Gray, police were warned about the dangerous transportation practices that killed him; Good community policing was very rare  —   typically left to a few cops who defied systemic problems; There are ”two Baltimores”  —   one white, one black  —   when it comes to policing; Baltimore police regularly violate people’s First Amendment rights; Baltimore police may not seriously investigate sexual assault cases; There’s little to no supervision and accountability at the Baltimore Police Department; and  Virtually all parties  —   even Baltimore police officers  —   agree reform is needed  He went on to write that it’s easy to see how almost all of these major flaws could have played into Gray’s arrest and the fact that he lost his life in police custody:     In the Justice Department’s very damning report on the Baltimore Police Department, Freddie Gray’s name was seldom mentioned  —   but it rang through all the findings as a reminder of just how horribly every aspect of policing can go. The report found a police force that got virtually everything wrong  —   pedestrian and traffic stops, use of force, arrests, transportation, training, oversight, accountability, basic interactions with the community, racial bias. We still don’t know everything about Gray’s death and the   to it  —   and we probably won’t ever know. But with this report, there is just enough context to put together the many mistakes that were made as Baltimore police arrested Gray and transported him in the last car ride of his life.    ",-1.0

"6 ways America totally screws over pregnant women and mothers.  It’s Mother’s Day, a time for cards, brunches, gifts, and appreciation.    But as Vox’s Ezra Klein notes, America actually has a funny way of showing its appreciation for mothers through its public policy. We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have some kind of guaranteed paid maternity or sick leave. Child care is obscenely expensive and not guaranteed, and mothers face a 5 percent wage penalty for every child they have. But as it turns out, that disregard for mothers at the policy level starts early  —   when women first get pregnant. We may say we love mothers, but we also have a weird tendency to do terrible things to the pregnant women who will soon become mothers. 1) We let postpartum women go back to work with gaping wounds            This is a consequence of the fact that we don’t have guaranteed paid maternity leave, but it doesn’t get discussed as much as the whole ”mom and dad need time to bond with baby” thing. (Which, to be clear, they absolutely do.)    Childbirth is a massive ordeal for the body to go through, and women’s bodies needs time to recover. This should be obvious, and to most people it is. But we don’t always think about what it means for a woman, physically, when she doesn’t get paid time off from her job, and when she simply can’t afford to take even unpaid time off  —   if, that is, her boss would let her take enough unpaid time off to fully heal in the first place.    An investigation from In These Times recently found that as many as one in four women go back to work less than two weeks after giving birth, largely due to economic pressures. That’s not nearly enough time to heal, especially if the birth had a complication. Reporter Sharon Lerner shares some horrific stories of what some of these women went through. One woman’s   wound hadn’t healed yet, and she went to work with pus dripping down her leg under her work clothes. Others developed depression and had breastfeeding problems because they were so constantly stressed and exhausted. I interviewed other women with similar experiences last year for Rewire.    ”Some of these moms are waitstaff, and they don’t have time to pump their milk, they’re going to be up on their feet, they’re going back to work in two weeks, they’re still bleeding, they’re still having pain from sutures, whether those are perineal sutures or abdominal sutures or both, some of them have pelvic floor problems, they’re urinating on themselves  —   but they’re going to go stand on their feet for 14 hours to make money?” Danielle Spradlin, a lactation consultant, told me then. ”That’s abhorrent. That’s how women die.” We could pass national paid family leave in this country, and we could do it relatively simply and cheaply. We’re just not doing it, and that means we get women bleeding and dripping pus at work because they don’t feel like they have other options. 2) Pregnancy discrimination at work is totally still a thing             This is including, but not limited to, women being fired, not hired, forced out of a job, and denied a private place to pump breast milk, really basic needs like water breaks or a stool to sit on, or work opportunities  —   just because they are pregnant.    ”Wait, aren’t there laws against that?” you might say. Why yes, there are! The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, as the name suggests, prohibits sex discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. But that law has limitations  —   aside from the fact that it’s a giant pain in the ass to actually take someone to court in order to make them respect your rights. For one thing, the law only applies to companies with more than 15 employees. It’s also written in such a way that a lot of employers are confused (or can credibly pretend to be confused) about what their obligations are. That’s why we need something like the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, says Emily Martin, vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. The bill, first introduced in Congress by Sen. Bob Casey ( ) in 2013, is clearer about the fact that pregnant women, specifically, need specific protections for all the things that come with being pregnant. The other challenge with getting real fairness for pregnant workers, Martin said, is the unconscious biases people often harbor toward mothers in the workplace. ”Some people may think, ’Pregnant women are trouble, and I’d rather not.’ They have subconscious stereotypes that mothers just aren’t as competent or committed to their work.” 3) We sometimes literally treat pregnant women like criminals            You know those dorm room debates about abortion you’ve had? Where the   person says, ”Well, if abortion were outlawed, we’d have to prosecute miscarriage as manslaughter!” And the   person rolls her eyes, because that’s just ridiculous? Turns out . .. that actually happens. Not just in countries like El Salvador where abortion is illegal, but also in America, where it’s supposed to be a constitutionally protected right.    American prosecutors don’t go after most women who have had miscarriages, of course. But as soon they get a whiff of circumstances surrounding a miscarriage that they might find morally objectionable  —   a fetus left in a dumpster after a miscarriage, a woman who tried to kill herself while she was pregnant, any woman who happened to be a drug addict when she miscarried  —   the prosecutors will come down on women with the full force of the law. Even though abortion is legal, one woman in Indiana was recently charged with   murder for trying to give herself a dangerous coat hanger abortion. (Prosecutors have since dropped those charges, but they’re still trying for aggravated assault.) And under a bizarre new law, now women in Indiana who have miscarriages are technically required to bring those remains (even if it’s just a blood clot from their latest period) into a hospital to have them cremated or buried. 4) Sometimes we do unspeakably awful things to pregnant women in jail            It’s not enough that we sometimes throw women in jail, or at least try to, for the crime of having a bad pregnancy outcome. We also do plenty to create bad pregnancy outcomes for women who have been thrown in jail. Most states still allow the monstrous practice of shackling pregnant women who are in labor, and even the states that have passed laws against it still don’t always enforce those laws very well. But that’s not all. Rewire produced an excellent, and incredibly depressing, series of articles last year about the other horrible things that new or expectant mothers, and women in general, can endure in the prison system.    Pregnant women have miscarriages because their guards or other caregivers don’t take their medical emergencies seriously. Pregnant women are not given enough food to sustain them during their pregnancies. Pregnant women are forced to undergo induced labor or   against their will. Mothers who commit minor crimes have their parental rights stripped away and aren’t given the chance to raise their own children. Jail is miserable for most people, and it’s designed to be. But for pregnant women and mothers, it can become tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. 5) Sometimes we let unspeakably awful things happen to pregnant women in general            This is a particular problem in Catholic hospitals, which provide one in six of America’s hospital beds. Catholic hospitals follow strict   guidelines from the bishops. That would be fine, religious freedom being what it is, except for two things. One, a lot of   women might not know that their nearest hospital is   with Catholic restrictions on reproductive health. Two, the Church’s   directives can have troubling health consequences for women who don’t even want an abortion. As the Guardian recently reported, one Catholic hospital operating under these doctrines systematically refused proper care to women having miscarriages. It forced one woman to go into sepsis before inducing labor, repeatedly sent another home in agony before treating her, and forced another woman to spend three days in the hospital before she required additional surgery. All of this was because these women’s medical emergencies weren’t yet literally   enough to warrant an ”abortion.” And the problem isn’t isolated to one hospital.    Nor is it just about Catholic hospitals. States that have enacted   abortion bans, like Texas, often refuse medical care to women who only find out at their   ultrasound that something is terribly wrong with their wanted pregnancy. One Texas woman was recently forced to spend four days delivering a stillborn baby instead of having the safe abortion her doctor recommended. 6) We don’t trust pregnant women to decide whether they want or need to stay pregnant            The majority of women who have abortions, about 60 percent, are already mothers. That means they know what it means to bear, give birth to, and raise a child. But lawmakers don’t treat them that way. In order to make sure women have really thought about their decision, they make women wait for 24, 48, even 72 hours (not including weekends, as if women only think on business days) to get an abortion. That means spending unnecessary extra time and money on getting to doctors’ appointments, when the vast majority of women have already made up their minds by the time they get to the clinic. Some states actually make doctors lie to women about the supposed ”risks” of abortion that the medical establishment disagrees are risks at all, like breast cancer or mental illness, in order to try to convince women to change their mind. These are only a few of the hundreds of   laws that have been passed just in the past five years  —   some of which have been specifically designed by   lobbyists to close clinics. Pregnancy is difficult, expensive, painful, and dangerous. For women who want a baby at the end of it all, it’s worth it. But for women who don’t, some people don’t think their opinion matters.

"Trump Week One: The return of the nation-state. The first week of the Trump administration has been a vindication of the American  . Anyone who thought it was a “borderless world,” a category that includes some significant portion of the country’s corporate and intellectual elite, has been disabused of the notion within about the first five days of the Trump years. Trump’s inaugural address was widely panned, but early polling indicates it was popular, which isn’t surprising since the broadly nationalistic sentiments in the speech were bound to strike people as common sense. “At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. ” Who else would it serve? “We are one nation . . . We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. ” What’s the alternative  —   two nations, with two hearts and homes? “From this moment on, it’s going to be America first. ” Why would anything else come first? “We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world  —   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first,” Trump said. Trump’s speech was less poetic, but in one sense more grounded than George W. Bush’s call for universal freedom in 2005 or Barack Obama’s vision of international cooperation leading to a new era of peace in 2009. Trump spoke of “the right of all nations to put their own interests first. ” If Bush was a vindicator of universal freedom, and Obama, in his more soaring moments, a citizen of the world, Trump is a dogged citizen of the United States concerned overwhelmingly with vindicating its interests. His executive order authorizing the building of the wall is an emphatic affirmation of one of the constituent parts of a nation, namely borders. Trump also began the process of going after sanctuary cities as entrepôts of illegal immigration acting in defiance of the nation’s laws. In general, immigration is an important focus for Trump’s nationalism because it involves the question of whether the American people have the sovereign authority to decide who gets to live here; whether the interests of American or foreign workers should be paramount; whether we assimilate the immigrants we already have into a common culture before welcoming more. The Trump phenomenon is pushback against what the late political scientist Samuel Huntington called the “deconstructionist” agenda, whose advocates seek to undermine America’s national identity through mass immigration and hostility to assimilation and opposition to the teaching of US history from a traditional, patriotic perspective, among other things. Huntington argues that until the late 20th century these elites promoted national unity, as one would expect. “Then in the 1960s and 1970s,” he writes, “they began to promote measures consciously designed to weaken America’s cultural and creedal identity and to strengthen racial, ethnic, cultural, and other subnational identities. These efforts by a nation’s leaders to deconstruct the nation they governed were, quite possibly, without precedent in human history. ” Trump is a welcome rebuke to this attitude, though caveats are necessary: A proper US nationalism should express not just an affinity for this country’s people, as Trump did in his address, but for its creed, its institutions and its history. These are absent from Trump’s rhetoric and presumably his worldview, impoverishing both. Trump’s nationalism has the potential to appeal across racial and ethnic lines, so long as he demonstrates that it isn’t just cover for his loyalty to his preferred subnational group. If Bush was overly expansive in his international vision, Trump could be overly pinched. Bush’s   program in Africa was unvarnished humanitarianism  —   and will redound to his credit, and the credit of this nation, for a very long time. Finally, Trump’s trade agenda is also an expression of his nationalism. Trade deals should be able to pass the   test  —   we shouldn’t embrace them for the sake of helping other nations, or out of strict libertarian principle. But protectionism is, historically, a   bonanza that delivers benefits to specific industries only at a disproportionate cost to the rest of the economy. All that said, the   is back, despite all the forecasts of its demise. The lesson is that it’s a mistake to predict the inevitable decline of things that give meaning to people’s lives and involve fundamental human attachments. The nation is one of them, something that Trump, if he gets nothing else, instinctively understands.",1.0
"Rogue One review: this is the first Star Wars movie to acknowledge the whole franchise is about war.  People die in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. A lot of them.    They die horrible deaths in spaceship crashes. They’re cut down by light sabers. They’re obliterated by giant explosions. They die brutally and nastily and quickly. They die, as most of us do, with unfinished business. In one terrible sequence, whole swaths of people are mowed down by an advancing enemy, as they try desperately to accomplish the one thing they need to do to get the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance.      Rating  3. 5        Oh, yes, this is a Star Wars movie  —   the first of Lucasfilm’s new “anthology” entries to the franchise, which will tell stories in and around the established Star Wars universe. Rather than picking up where last year’s The Force Awakens left off, Rogue One tells the story of how the Rebels got the Death Star plans in the first place, the one that set the plot of 1977’s Star Wars in motion and kicked off this entire saga. As such, the movie is caught between the artistic impulses of its director, Gareth Edwards, and its corporate masters. Sometimes, it’s a beautifully constructed antidote to years and years of fake, digitized movie destruction, with precisely crafted frames and genuinely groundbreaking cinematography. At other times, it’s a bumpily edited mess that was   assembled in   from a variety of possible outcomes.    It’s a flawed movie, but a good one, sometimes more interesting as a concept than a story. But, oh, what a concept!     Rogue One is a Star Wars movie with an emphasis on the “war”             The unifying theme of Rogue One is simple: People die in wars. If the Star Wars saga is about a war between freedom and tyranny, then a lot of people are going to die fighting that war. Those on the side of good are going to make questionable decisions. Those on the side of evil are sometimes just doing their jobs but will get their lives snuffed out anyway. Edwards emphasizes this inevitable death throughout. When two starships collide, he’ll intercuts shots of the people inside those starships, toppling over, never having realized that this particular day was the day they would die.     In and of itself, these insert shots of the humans in the midst of destruction are no different from the ones you might see in other   adventures, but Edwards repeats this pattern. He always shows you someone’s body flying backward from an explosion, presumably broken. Two Imperial Stormtroopers shoot the breeze about a   matter before they’re gunned down. Main characters die. Villains die. Faceless extras die. And they all die the same way  —   too soon. Edwards is not a terribly great filmmaker when it comes to telling stories about human beings. His first feature, the microbudgeted indie film Monsters, was essentially a     romance that just happened to have a giant monster movie taking place in the background, and he’s tried to apply that approach to both of his big studio productions; here are some real human moments happening in front of the chaos. I loved the first of those big studio films, 2014’s Godzilla, but even I would admit that its human characters are   at best. Rogue One attempts to craft full character arcs for its most important figures  —   particularly its main duo, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna)  —   but those arcs lurch awkwardly from one plot point to the next. At one point, I thought the film was missing important footage, because so many scenes were being paid off without any real setup.     Edwards has widely been criticized as loving spectacle for its own sake, rather than loving human beings. But I don’t think that’s accurate, because of how good Edwards is at capturing one human emotion in particular: dread. In all three of his films, he’s tremendous at conveying his characters’ certainty that they’re going to die, as they watch the giant monster or the   Walker burst toward them through the haze. Sometimes, they’re saved. But much of the time, Edwards’s films live in a realm of quaking terror, in the idea that you can’t escape a very specific death, but can only await it. He excels at telling stories about what it feels like to be crushed  —   by a monster, by a war machine, by a political system.  Rogue One isn’t a political film. It’s a   film.             That general idea  —   what does it feel like to be crushed?  —   has led to hopes from some that Rogue One will be a rousing call to arms against the global rise of right wing nationalism. And that reading is certainly easy to make. There are lots of rousing speeches, and some poignant dialogue from characters who call out others for not realizing the desperate straits of those the Empire treats as all but chattel. But if the film is politically relevant, it’s only accidentally so, not intentionally. I say that not just because Rogue One was completed long before Donald Trump’s election or even Brexit, but because Edwards uses a kind of scattershot approach to political content in his films  —   he’ll give you just enough of an idea of what he’s going for, but he’s uninterested in pushing any further than that. An early shot in Rogue One features Stormtroopers patrolling the streets of a city rife with tension between various factions, rolling around in a tank. At various moments, it calls to mind the US occupation of Iraq and police militarization of American cities. But it’s not entirely clear whether Edwards has thought about what these similarities might mean in the larger tapestry of Rogue One beyond “Do you get this reference?” It’s political commentary as Family Guy joke. To be clear, I don’t think Edwards needs to have his characters take center stage and say, “Fascism is bad. Also, the tank represented occupying forces!” We can draw these parallels for ourselves. But for political nods to work, they must be driven by some larger idea, and Rogue One is too all over the place, without any larger idea to speak of.     For a while, in the early going, it seems like the movie is going to argue that political divisions don’t really matter for most people who aren’t lucky enough to be protagonists (a. k. a. the intergalactic elite) because they might just as easily be killed by the Rebels as by the Empire. But it quickly backs away from that idea, perhaps realizing that it would be harder to sell Rebel Alliance toys if they were painted as too morally murky.  It also never does anything with an early story thread about the Rebels having an offshoot splinter group  —   led by a character played by the instantly compelling Forest Whitaker  —   which believes in taking brutal retaliatory measures, instead of attempting to pacify the Empire, as the Rebels apparently do. (Indeed, it’s not clear if the events of Rogue One kick off the war from Star Wars or just sort of take place during a lull in hostilities.) There’s something in here about whether capitulating to an enemy in the name of a greater good is still evil, but Rogue One doesn’t know what to do with it. Thus, the politics of the movie are mostly aware they should be present, but also not   enough to be coherent. Which, sadly, is often of a piece with much of the rest of the film.  Rogue One has big script problems, but it also has a good script             Rogue One’s screenplay, from veteran writers Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, is very obviously a patchwork job.  It establishes character backstories and motivations seemingly at random, it introduces major plot points shortly before they are resolved, and it sends Jyn on a journey from “reluctant passenger in the narrative” to “daring leader” seemingly over the course of a single scene. As in Godzilla, I didn’t really know what any of these people wanted beyond their most obvious,   goals. And yet I found myself occasionally moved by it all the same. Weitz and Gilroy have an ear for a line that neatly summarizes a character’s point of view in a few words, and they write good rousing speeches (though perhaps too many of them). It’s as if Rogue One has a bad script and a good script simultaneously.    The movie has severe story problems  —   in that the first and second acts are filled with    momentum that keeps stumbling just when it’s getting going  —   as well as one of the better big action climaxes you’ll see in a theater this year. By the time Jyn and her crew are trying to steal the Death Star plans, everything Rogue One is trying to do comes together in a mostly satisfying way. Do I wish that I cared more about Jyn’s crew as individuals in that third act? Yes. But the actors playing them  —   particularly Donnie Yen as a blind   Jedi and Alan Tudyk’s voice as a sarcastic robot  —   were so good and having so much fun that the characters manage to coast off of that, just a little bit. And the movie is replete with Star Wars Easter eggs  —   so many I’m sure I missed a few. And even when you’re feeling let down by the lurching storytelling, Edwards’s eye for beautiful, almost painterly images carries the day. Rather than offer the sort of bright, poppy frames of most modern blockbusters, Edwards and his director of photography Greig Fraser favor a more diffuse, naturalistic look  —   the better to contrast with the harsher, more mechanical lighting within the Imperial ships. It could feel soft and unfocused. Instead, it only allows the darkness around the edges of the film’s frames to begin creeping in. Don’t get me wrong. This is still Star Wars. It’s not going to offer up a blistering tirade against combat, nor a bromide against the   complex. The good guys are still mostly good. The bad guys are still mostly bad. There’s still a man dressed all in black who can choke you with a hand gesture, and a scrappy band who stands up to all that darkness.  It’s just that where other Star Wars movies focus on the brightness of the stars, Rogue One is a little more comfortable staring at the inky black spaces in between, and wondering what they might hold. I wouldn’t want every Star Wars movie to be like that, but I’m glad this one is. Rogue One opens in theaters on Friday, December 16. Special preview airings will be held Thursday, December 15.

"Trump tells stunned NATO leaders they need to pay up. President Trump scolded stunned NATO members on Thursday, saying they must “pay what they owe” to support the global alliance because “it is not fair to the taxpayers of the United States. ” “In facing our common challenges, we must also ensure that NATO members meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe. Many have not been doing that,” Trump told the assembled leaders at the organization’s new headquarters in Brussels. “If NATO countries made their full and complete contributions, then NATO would be even stronger than it is today​ especially from the threat of terrorism,” he said. ​ During his spirited and pointed remarks, ​​the gathered NATO leaders  —   including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron  —   gave each other sidelong glances and remained standing by in awkward silence. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been critical of Trump’s lectures about NATO in the past, stared straight ahead. Trump, who during the presidential campaign called NATO “obsolete,” urged the countries to pay their own way by increasing their defense spending to 2 percent of their gross domestic product, saying it “is not fair to the taxpayers of the United States. ”   of the 28 members are not paying what they should, he said, and many owe “massive amounts of money from past years. ” “Over ​the ​last ​eight​ years​ the US spent more on ​defense​​ than all other ​NATO cou​ntries combined,” Trump said. “If all NATO members had spent just 2 percent of their GDP on defense last year, we would have had another $119 billion for our collective defense​​​ and for the financing of additional NATO reserves. ” He even took a shot at NATO for its       headquarters. “I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost. I refuse to do that, but it is beautiful​,” he said.​ But the terror bombing in Manchester, England, on Monday evening that killed 22 people was a stark reminder of the continued global threat at the gathering, where a chunk of the Berlin Wall and a twisted piece of metal from the north tower of the World Trade Center were unveiled. ​Many had wanted Trump to use the occasion to show his commitment to Article 5, or mutual assistance, of the NATO alliance, but he only mentioned it in passing in connection to the war in Afghanistan. The principle was only activated once, after  . “That is why a strong NATO is good for Europe and good for North America,” he said. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked why Trump didn’t address the issue specifically, said the president is “fully committed. ” “If you are standing at a ceremony talking about the invocation of Article 5 after   and talking about that, that is a pretty clear indication of the support that exists for it,” Spicer said. After calling for a moment of silence for the victims of the Manchester attack, Trump reiterated his call to drive the terrorists out “and never let them back in. ” “Terrorism must be stopped or   …     the horror you saw in Manchester and so many other places will continue forever,”​ he said.​",1.0

"Trump’s labor secretary pick: “I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis”.    Donald Trump is rumored to be considering fast food CEO Andy Puzder to be his secretary of labor. Like most of Trump’s Cabinet picks so far, Puzder would probably dismantle or oppose key Obama priorities, like expanding overtime pay and raising the minimum wage.    But what makes Puzder a particularly Trumpian pick is his attitude toward women. Like Trump, Puzder is very open about how much he enjoys objectifying women, and how he likes to use that objectification as a business strategy.  Puzder is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which operates Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. For the last decade or so, Carl’s Jr. has been known for running controversial TV ads featuring models eating hamburgers in various gross, oversexed ways.  Like this infamous 2005 ad, where Paris Hilton briefly pauses the porniest car wash ever to chomp on an inexplicably   burger:     Or this one from 2012, where Kate Upton basically uses hamburger juice as lube:  “I like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American,” Puzder told Entrepreneur in 2015. “I used to hear, brands take on the personality of the CEO. And I rarely thought that was true, but I think this one, in this case, it kind of did take on my personality. ” Puzder says the ads are aimed at “young hungry guys”  —   and that if the ads aren’t offending people, he’s doing something wrong. If advocates don’t complain, Puzder said, “I go to the head of marketing and say, ’What’s wrong with our ads?’ Those complaints aren’t necessarily bad for us. What you look at is, you look at sales. And, our sales go up. ”    It’s the same blasé,     “screw political correctness” attitude toward women and gender that Trump has shown for years, both on the campaign trail and throughout his life.   Trump talks about his admiration for “beautiful” women so often, it’s almost a verbal tic. He demonstrated his own fondness for women in bikinis (outside of beach settings) when he bought the Miss Universe pageant  —   and when he, by his own admission, barged into the contestants’ dressing room to ogle them while they were changing.  Trump has also been accused of sexual assault by a total of 15 women over the years, most of whom only came forward recently.     It was revealed Thursday evening that Puzder has been accused of more than just objectifying. Puzder was accused of domestic abuse by his first wife in the 1980s, the Riverfront Times reports, and police were called to their house twice.  In a statement, Puzder’s   Lisa Fierstein (formerly Henning) said: “Andy is one of the finest men I have ever known. Many years ago I impulsively filed for divorce and was counseled to file allegations that I regretted and subsequently withdrew over thirty years ago. Andy is a wonderful father, a great person, and was a good husband. ” Puzder also denied allegations of abuse to both the Riverfront Times and the St. Louis   in 1989.   Decades later, Puzder  —   after five women had newly accused Trump of assault, and while Trump was facing criticism on the campaign trail for bragging on tape about forcing himself on women  —   was one of 100 business leaders to sign a letter supporting Trump and urging Americans to focus on his economic policies instead.   Powerful men often stick up for other powerful men who are accused of sexual impropriety. Indeed, Trump has often sought advice from other men who have been accused of abusing women  —   notably his friend Roger Ailes (who resigned as CEO of Fox News over multiple charges of sexual harassment) and Trump’s incoming chief adviser Steve Bannon (who was accused of domestic violence against his  ).    Update: This post has been updated with a statement from Lisa Fierstein.  ",-1.0
"Early voting looks good for Clinton — but the race is still tightening.  Two things appear to be true: Early voting results are looking good for Hillary Clinton, and the polls are tightening. Clinton is now only polling about 2 points above Donald Trump nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, a difference that has narrowed drastically from what was a   lead just over a week ago.    At the same time, new early voting numbers out of Nevada and Ohio this week were a good sign for the Democratic candidate, as turnout seems to be bouncing back to 2012 levels. In Nevada, Clark County (home to Las Vegas) is proving to be a promising firewall for Clinton. And in Ohio, similarly,   counties are beginning to pick up the pace. Currently, early voting is at 60 percent of 2012  —   in other words, 40 percent of votes cast in 2012 are still ”out there.” This discrepancy can be confusing; why are these two metrics are seemingly pointing in opposite directions? But according to early voting experts, there is a simple explanation: On a national scale, there is not that much of a discrepancy at all, and moreover, results from    early voting and national polling simply can’t be compared. Brian Hamel, a researcher with the Early Voting Information Center, said early vote numbers are also tightening up at this point: Nationwide, about 7. 4 million Democrats have voted and 6. 4 million Republicans have voted, CNN reported. “That suggests a relatively close national race,” Hamel, a political science PhD student at Universisty of California, Los Angeles, said.     This doesn’t discount Clinton’s gains in early voting, however. On that level, early voting numbers and polling are essentially apples and oranges. “We should not be concerned if polls do not match up to early voting metrics, given that they measure fundamentally different things,” Hamel said.    Early voting and polling measure different things Early voting and polling are two different metrics. The primary difference is that early voting results capture trends in actual votes over several weeks, whereas polls are a snapshot in time.     It’s an important distinction to take into account, as voters tendencies, as reflected in the polls, may be more influenced by the news events  —   whether that’s the sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump or the FBI reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Those shifts in opinion may not reflect overall voting habits, and they don’t necessarily capture the nature of an early voter. Early voting is usually a good measure of two things: enthusiasm and a campaign’s ability to mobilize its electorate. Lots of early voters means lots of decided voters, not voters that are easily swayed by news events. And while there doesn’t seem to be much enthusiasm for either candidate this year, there is some speculation that people voting against the opposing candidate rather than affirmatively voting for their candidate might bring people to the polls.    When the early voting periods were about to open, Michael McDonald, an early voting expert with University of Florida, told CNBC he was watching the Hispanic and rural white vote. ”There is speculation that Trump’s rhetoric could entice Hispanics to vote against him, and there is some evidence in polls that Hispanic voting enthusiasm is running higher than normal,” he told CNBC. The same theory can be applied to black voters, Paul Gronke, director of the Early Voting Information Center, said. ”Trump continues to make statements that alienate   voters, and he struggles to get beyond 2 percent in some state polls. Under that circumstance, and faced with a   Democratic [   ] machine, why would   voters wait?” Gronke told me in September, noting that Trump also doesn’t seem to have much of an early voter   operation. Just as national polling doesn’t predict    Electoral College results, early voting doesn’t predict the Election Day results It’s also important to note that early voting results are not a good indication of actual election results. There are a lot of limitations: States reporting early voting totals don’t always include all counties; some states require party registration, like North Carolina, while others, like Wisconsin, don’t; and numbers derived from party registration are fallible  —   nothing is obligating registered Republicans or Democrats to vote for their party’s nominee, for instance.  Making comparisons across state lines is also difficult. Some states have weeks of early voting and many early voting locations, while others have limited opportunities to cast a ballot early. University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket crunched the numbers for FiveThirtyEight on how well early voting numbers predicted the final tally in past elections. He simply concluded, “The relationship is positive, but it’s pretty noisy. In other words, knowing how a party is doing in early voting doesn’t tell you much about how it will do once all the votes are counted. ” In fact, he found that looking at early voting numbers in 2012 would give you “wildly misleading” results: Democrats maintained substantial leads among early voters in North Carolina, Louisiana and West Virginia, and were trailing by a relatively narrow margin in Oklahoma, but still lost those states when all the votes were counted. Republicans won early voters in Pennsylvania and Colorado but lost the final tallies there. Maryland was a safely Democratic state in 2012, but the 75 percent of the early vote that went the Democrats’ way was a far cry from the 63 percent of the total vote they won once voting was finished.    Rather, “early voting might be best interpreted as an indication of how campaigns are going to use their resources in the final weeks,” Hamel said  —   it’s a good measure of how campaigns need to mobilize their voters for Election Day. This comes into play in states like Ohio, where “lower overall turnout and lower Democratic turnout in Cuyahoga [County, home to Cleveland] suggests that Election Day     in Ohio is going be huge for the Clinton campaign. ” As Gronke explains, early votes have been “banked,” just as you bank your money  —   “it protects you against   fluctuations in the electoral market,” he said.  Polling is not “banked. ”     ",-1.0
"Can Paul Ryan and Donald Trump coexist within the Republican Party?.  House Speaker Paul D. Ryan attempted to lift the horizons of his party with a speech last week in which he called for a competition of ideas rather than insults and constructive political debate rather than the politics of demonization. Ryan’s speech was aimed at pulling the Republican Party away from Donald Trump’s embrace  —   though he never actually mentioned Trump by name. Events quickly showed what he is up against. The speaker was quickly drowned out by a snarling argument between Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas over their wives that almost eclipsed the terrorist attacks in Brussels in the U. S. media. By week’s end, the Republican race had gone down into the gutter over tabloid charges of infidelity, which the senator vehemently denied and for which he blamed the New York billionaire, who called it unfounded. A race that seemed already at the bottom managed to find another low. Ryan’s speech was a relatively   moment in the middle of this mud fight of a Republican nominating contest. His effort to rescue the party from a coming crisis is laudable, but the root causes of the condition go far beyond Trump.  [Ryan seeks a more positive tone to political debate]    Donald and Melania Trump and Heidi and Ted Cruz. (FROM LEFT TO RIGHT: AP   OsorioJim    Images)  The   for the nomination of the Republican Party is as much a reflection of the condition as a cause, a reality that Ryan touched on only lightly in calling for a more positive and uplifting approach to politics by all sides. Which means stopping Trump alone won’t necessarily solve all of the party’s problems. Four years ago, scholars Thomas Mann, then with the Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein, then and now with the American Enterprise Institute, published a book examining the breakdown in American politics. It was titled, “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks. ” The authors took aim at the gridlocked and dysfunctional politics of Washington and the broader issue of political polarization that has become endemic in recent years. They were unsparing but not   in their critique. They were ahead of others in describing the underlying causes of polarization as asymmetrical, with the Republican Party  —   in particular its most   faction  —   as deserving of far more of the blame for the breakdown in governing. Mann and Ornstein are back again with a second and updated paperback edition, called “It’s Even Worse Than It Was. ” The paperback arrives in the middle of the most raucous presidential campaign in memory, one that has exposed even more the fissures, fractures and divisions within the Republican Party coalition. What played out primarily in the party’s congressional wing has now come to consume the presidential nominating contest. In their own ways, Trump and Cruz have brought up to the surface the economic and cultural anger among many of those in the party’s base as well as the distrust of the party leadership  —   the same motivating forces behind the Freedom Caucus rebels in the House Republican conference.  [Cruz, Trump trade more charges in heated GOP argument]  The current campaign only adds fuel to the   thesis of a Republican Party at war with itself in ways that have helped cripple the governing process. Trump and Cruz reflect the yearning within the Republican base for   outsiders to topple the insiders in Washington.   Donald Trump, the Republican   denies rival Ted Cruz’s allegation that he planted a story about the senator having extramarital affairs. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third remaining candidate for the nomination, is a dissenting voice, calling for cooperation and compromise. At this point, he is not just a dissenting voice; he is a minority voice in the presidential competition unless he can start winning more primaries. Trump and Ryan ( .) represent bookends in a political debate that has considerable consequences for the Republican Party and for the country. Trump’s position as GOP   not only highlights the degree to which the party is being taken over by   forces but also foreshadows the possibility of a significant defeat in November, if as the GOP nominee Trump is unable to reverse his standing among women, Hispanics, African Americans and other voting groups. Ryan represents something far different, politics grounded in ideas and policies and an attitude of good will toward the opposition that he inherited from his mentor, Jack Kemp, the former House member from Buffalo who prodded his party to be more open and inclusive. Yet Ryan’s speech left unanswered key questions about his capacity to change the behavior of his party’s conference in the House and in particular the degree to which he is willing to find a governing coalition apart from the   in the Freedom Caucus. As the country’s   Republican elected official, Ryan symbolizes the establishment’s backlash to Trump’s candidacy, a backlash that has so far failed to stop the New York businessman’s march to the nomination. The resistance might yet succeed. Whether it does or doesn’t, it raises the question of whether this presidential campaign ultimately will produce a true course change for the party or merely end up intensifying the forces that have brought it to this moment. I put that question to Ornstein in an email exchange Friday: “This really is, I believe, an existential crisis for the Republican Party,” he wrote. “Will it be a   conservative,   party, or will it be either a   authoritarian, nativist and protectionist party, or a   radical antigovernment party content with blowing things up as they now stand? Or, just as possible, will the party break apart, with no clue as to what will replace it or how the pieces will fit into the broader political system?”  [Transcript of Trump’s interview with Post editorial board]  The prospects for a crackup are real, given what Trump’s candidacy has revealed about the party’s fractured coalition. Trump’s views on issues, outlined on the campaign trail and in a recent interview with the Washington Post editorial board, represent a fundamental break with many of the conservative ideas that have been at the party’s core for years. Trump’s constituency finds his support for protecting rather than transforming Social Security and Medicare appealing. His words of praise for the work of Planned Parenthood, apart from performing abortions, are anathema to many religious conservatives. His views on trade run counter to the   philosophy of the GOP elites. His comments about reevaluating the U. S. role in NATO shocked many in the Republican foreign policy establishment. That’s the threat Ryan and others in the party see as they watch the nominating contest move into the next rounds of primaries. But it isn’t clear that what the speaker advocated in his speech would be enough to put the Republican Party in a better place, even absent Trump. House Republicans are still an unruly group and, with some exceptions, the GOP still prefers to try to do business with itself. The Republican Party remains a party of protest. It continues to struggle to demonstrate that, on the national level, it can be a true governing party. ",-0.5
"The paradox at the heart of Obama’s Central American refugee policy.  How dangerous does the United States government think El Salvador really is?    Depending on how you look at it, the government’s answer to that question is either nuanced or dangerously inconsistent. In January, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the US will be devoting particular attention to finding and processing refugees in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to bring to the United States. But the administration is simultaneously continuing the nationwide raids it started in the first days of 2016 to find and deport families who had failed to get asylum and been ordered to leave the country. In other words, at the same time that the US is promising to bring people out of Central America to the US, it’s fighting very hard to send some Central Americans back.      Related The nationwide raids targeting Central American families, explained; Hondurans fled to the US because their lives were in danger. The US sent them back.  To advocates, immigration judges, and Central American diplomats, it’s a dangerous paradox. There appear to be serious concerns that the same people the US wants to save from danger in Central America are the ones it’s deporting.    ”The administration continues to support refugee processing programs while ignoring those already in the United States,” says Jose   of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. The problem, he says, is ”the broader theme in the administration’s foreign policy: Individuals fleeing persecution and violence are ’undocumented immigrants’ if they are from Central America and ’refugees’ if they are from anywhere else.”             The government wants to provide a ”safe, legal” path to the US  —   but it might take years The US doesn’t set firm caps on refugees from particular countries  —   instead, it sets targets by region, based on where it’s allocating resources to process refugee applications to begin with.    In recent years, the government simply hasn’t put a lot of effort into taking refugees from Central America. Now it’s promising to change that. For those advocating for refugees, the   scenario is that in a few years, the US will be letting in as many refugees from Central America as it currently does from the Democratic Republic of Congo: a few thousand a year. ”I don’t think it’s going to be a massive protection mechanism,” says Wendy Young, the director of Kids In Need of Defense and a leading refugee advocate. ”At least not initially.” And she cautions that ”it’s going to take a while to set up.” People fleeing imminent danger don’t have that kind of time. This is one of the biggest problems with refugee admissions.    Young and other advocates have expressed hope that the US and United Nations will figure out some way to protect the people being processed  —   maybe by bringing them to a third country while their applications go through. But that’s a big question mark. International law requires countries not to send anyone back to a place they might be in mortal danger. And in some cases, when the US has been concerned enough about security in a given country to expand refugee operations there, it’s also been concerned enough to protect people living in the US from getting sent back to that country  —   by granting them something called temporary protected status (TPS). That’s what  ’s group is arguing the administration should do now for Central Americans.   points out that this is what happened with Syria: The US granted TPS to Syrians in the US in 2012, ”to complement the United States’ broader efforts to admit Syrian refugees.” But he and other advocates allege that when Central Americans flee to the US without papers, the administration is more interested in treating them as unauthorized immigrants than as refugees. The administration believes not everyone fleeing Central America is equally in danger As far as the law is concerned, there’s no such thing as illegal immigration for asylum seekers: If you’re coming to the US to seek asylum, it doesn’t matter whether you have papers or not. But as far as the Obama administration is concerned, thousands of people coming to the US without papers is a bad look. The administration paints this as a humanitarian concern. When Secretary Kerry announced that the government would expand refugee processing in Central America, he said he wanted to ”offer [refugees] a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey that many are tempted to begin, making them at that instant easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits.” But it’s also a matter of enforcement. The government thinks simply coming from Central America doesn’t necessarily mean that someone is in mortal peril, and they want to be able to distinguish the legitimate refugees from everyone else. ”While we recognize the serious underlying conditions that cause some people to flee their home countries,” a senior administration official told Vox, ”we cannot allow our borders to be open to illegal migration.”    So some people  —   those who come to the US, seek asylum, and have their cases rejected  —   are getting sent home. Essentially, the US is saying that Central America is dangerous, but not for them.            This doesn’t violate the legal principle against sending someone back to danger  —   as long as, as Vanessa Allyn of the advocacy group Human Rights First points out, there’s a ”   assessment.” And the federal government has maintained, since starting the raids and deportations at the beginning of 2016, that it is only targeting families who have, as the senior administration official put it, ”exhausted appropriate legal remedies.” But if the US is sending some people back to El Salvador or Honduras, while recognizing that other people are in too much danger to return, it had better be damn sure that it’s getting it right. How sure is the government that it’s not sending people back to their deaths? The advocates are worried that the US’s desire to deter people from making ”the dangerous journey” is making it less likely to give a full and fair assessment to people who seek asylum here. ”They’re finally recognizing in the region that Central Americans in fact are refugees,” Young says, ”and yet we’re still treating them as undocumented, unlawful arrivals when they arrive at the US border.” Yet Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world of any country that isn’t at war. So it could be likely that those going back face a grim demise.    It’s not like the US has a great track record with asylum seekers in the recent past. One man deported to Honduras in 2014 told Human Rights Watch that ”I asked for asylum, the officer told me don’t apply.” He and the other deportees interviewed in the report said they were in grave danger in their home countries  —   afraid to see their kids or even tell their families they were back. And some deportees have, in fact, been killed after their return. ”The people fleeing who make it to the US are really the exact same people that we’ll be processing in the region,” says Young.             Young is worried about a revival of the Haitian crisis of the early 1990s. The US government opened up ” ” refugee processing for Haitians, but used it as an excuse to start interdicting boats of Haitians trying to flee to the US. ”They were really trying to circumvent Haitians’ arrival in the US, and keep them offshore and manage it that way,” she says. The administration doesn’t put it that way. But it does acknowledge that its strategy is, in part, to deter people from using smugglers to get to the US while the government works to provide the ”safe and legal alternative.” ”We cannot encourage folks to take that dangerous journey,” said the senior administration official. The courts and Central American countries are worried the US is moving too fast Advocates complain that asylum cases are being heard on a ”rocket docket” that doesn’t give immigrants a fair hearing in court. And it seems that the nation’s highest immigration court shares their concerns  —   and doesn’t agree with the administration that the people it’s trying to deport have ”exhausted all their options.” Soon after the first round of raids, lawyers asked the Board of Immigration Appeals to issue emergency rulings to halt the deportations of six of the Central American families. Within hours, the board granted those rulings in five cases.    Advocates were stunned. ”The board never acts so fast,” Wendy Feliz of the American Immigration Council told the Houston Chronicle. ”This is totally unusual.” And the stays kept coming. More than 20 of the first 121 immigrants arrested in the January raids have gotten stays  —   almost all of those who had lawyers fighting their cases. The reasoning for the stays isn’t provided. But advocates and Hill Democrats have taken the court rulings as evidence that judges share their concerns  —   that the government hasn’t proved it will be safe for these people to return, after all. ”The fact that several of these families were subsequently granted emergency stays of removal indicates that the system has failed these refugees,” wrote 142 House Democrats in a   letter to the administration. ”We are gravely concerned that DHS may have already removed mothers and children from the United States and returned them to violent and dangerous situations in their home countries.”            In an even more extraordinary development, the government of El Salvador stepped in to stop 22 people from getting deported back to its country. In 2014, Central American governments cooperated with deportations and endorsed the US’s strategy; this time, a Salvadoran official told the press, ”No compatriot detained in the raids will be deported until all legal measures have been exhausted.” Three Salvadoran families were literally pulled off the plane that was supposed to take them back. This certainly doesn’t indicate confidence in the Obama administration’s claims that it’s only deporting people after ensuring they won’t be in danger. According to the senior administration official, applying for refugee status in Central America is the ”vastly preferred alternative” to coming to the US and requesting asylum. But as Young points out, they’re the ”exact same people.” The administration is struggling to balance the humanitarian need to make the right decisions against the deterrent need to deport people quickly and efficiently.    The stakes are literally life and death. ",-1.0

"Republicans should be relieved Mueller will serve as special prosecutor.    As the Trump presidency enters its fourth month, conservatives are eager for more legislative successes, more nominations and confirmations of judges, the rapid confirmation of a new FBI director and other achievements. Given the charges of collusion and obstruction that have dogged Donald Trump and his administration from before he took his oath of office as president, the appointment of former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III as a special prosecutor to oversee the Justice Department’s inquiry into those charges is a greatly encouraging development. In Mueller, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein has made an excellent choice that will allow Republicans to again concentrate on turning the country around. It’s true that I have opposed a special prosecutor in the past. I did so for two reasons. First, if the allegations of the politicization of the IRS during Barack Obama’s presidency didn’t warrant a special prosecutor, then one certainly isn’t necessary now. Second, I feared that the individual chosen as special prosecutor would not be another Jacob Stein  —   the independent counsel who efficiently investigated charges against Attorney   Edwin Meese when Meese was nominated for that job, clearing Meese within months. Instead, the appointee would be another Lawrence Walsh  who, for a variety of reasons, let his investigations into the   affair linger and metastasize over years and years. Walsh was appointed in December of 1986. He submitted his final report on Aug. 4, 1993. I don’t want to relitigate  ; I merely point out that a    investigation into any scandal is not what either special prosecutors (appointed by the attorney general or, in this case, his deputy) or the old independent counsels (appointed by a panel of judges under a statute now expired) were thought to be about.  The bar is lower for Republicans, of course, and so the media joined in the clamor for a special counsel here whereas the IRS scandal didn’t ignite such demands. But set that aside. With the right professional in the job, it is, as a practical matter of politics and government, better to go this route than to prolong the media frenzy about whether such a professional is needed.   Mueller is not just a seasoned investigator and prosecutor, a decorated combat veteran of the Marines, a widely respected former head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U. S. attorney and of course director of the FBI. He also represents the potential for a decisive end to the Russian probe. He brings such credibility that if and when he says “there is no ‘there’ there,” responsible media will accept it. Those, such as me, who think all of the signs point to that conclusion regarding the president and the White House staff, will welcome that closure. The partisan left may not go along, but the public will. There is no telling where Mueller’s investigation will go or how long it will take, but I have confidence that if it can be concluded quickly because the charges of collusion are baseless, he will follow that path, indifferent to critics of his conclusions or his timeline. He’s a serious and experienced person who has helped lead the battle against terrorism and knows that serious threats and crimes merit close inspection and indeed prosecution but political disputes robed in baseless charges do not.  If the president and his team in the White House did nothing wrong  —   and there is only innuendo, no hard evidence that they did  —   Mueller will reach that conclusion quickly. If former national security adviser Michael Flynn and others are innocent of the many charges leveled at them, they too should be happy that a straight shooter such as Mueller is in charge of saying so. Someone was going to have to make the final call, and Democrats (not all, certainly, but the responsible ones) will accept Mueller’s conclusions. In the interim, the president and Congress can refocus on saving the   system from its ongoing collapse, rebuilding the military, reforming the tax system and staffing up the judiciary. They will be able to do so because Rosenstein found the right person and the right person was willing to serve.

"Tourist who put a baby bison in SUV: ‘I thought it was going to be a happy ending’.      The Yellowstone National Park tourists who loaded a baby bison into the back of an SUV last month say they thought the calf was already abandoned and believed they were doing a “nice thing” for the animal, which was later euthanized. “It was the way it was presented (in news coverage) it was like we didn’t know what we were doing,” one of the men, Shamash Kassam, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” in an interview that aired Friday. The media, Kassam said, reported that “we picked up the bison because it was shivering  —   that was not the reason why. We picked up the bison because it was abandoned by the herd. ” He also noted: “We thought we were doing a nice thing by taking it to the rangers. ” A photo of the calf in the back of the SUV sparked widespread outrage in the wake of the   incident, with the actions of Shamash Kassam and his son, Shakeel, widely criticized. In a news release, the park cautioned that “interference by people” can cause mothers to reject their young. The park also said that the calf the Kassams had picked up had to be killed. “In this case, park rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the newborn bison calf with the herd,” a Yellowstone statement said. “These efforts failed. The bison calf was later euthanized because it was abandoned and causing a dangerous situation by continually approaching people and cars along the roadway. ” ABC News reported that the father and son thought the calf would have died if they hadn’t stepped in.   [Previously: Baby bison dies after Yellowstone tourists put it in their car because it looked cold]   “We didn’t have the heart to, kind of, just leave it there and let it suffer, you know, as the darkness descended,” Shakeel Kassam told ABC News. He said he and his father had “no idea it was going to turn out so bad like that. ” “I thought it was going to be a happy ending, and the calf was going to be integrated with another herd, and everything was going to be fine,” he said. Shakeel Kassam told ABC News that when they spotted the bison in the park, they initially decided to leave it alone. But his father later changed his mind, according to “Good Morning America. ” “I told him, let’s go see what is happening, because that thing is going to be eaten alive,” Shamash Kassam said in the interview. The Kassams didn’t have cellphone service, ABC reported, so they loaded up the calf and connected with a park ranger, who gave them a “good scolding,” Shakeel Kassam said.   [Seriously, people, stay away from the bison]   ABC reported: They followed the ranger to try to return the calf to where they first encountered it, but the animal resisted. “I did my best. I lifted it up. It started kicking. Put it down. I tried to push it. And it did not want to go,” Shakeel Kassam said. Finally, they took the bison toward the herd and left it there. “And then the ranger told us, ‘You go away because he wants to follow you.’ So once we went away, he was able to join with the other herd   …     So that was the end of it,” said Shamash Kassam, a Quebec resident. Shamash Kassam was fined after pleading guilty to a wildlife disturbance citation, according to the CBC. As part of his probation, he was also told that he “shall not pick up any more bison,” CBC reports. As The Post’s Karin Brulliard has previously reported, bison calves typically nurse for at least seven months. A Yellowstone spokeswoman told The Post that she did not know how old the deceased calf was, but she said it was “certainly dependent on mother’s milk. ” Park officials did not consider feeding the calf until it was able to feed on grass, spokeswoman Charissa Reid said, in part because it’s not terribly unusual that calves separated from their mothers starve to death or are killed by predators. “In Yellowstone, it’s not a zoo,” Reid said. “We don’t manage for individuals; we manage for ecosystems. ” About 4, 900 bison, which recently became America’s national mammal, live in Yellowstone. Park regulations require visitors to stay at least 25 yards, or 75 feet, away from all wildlife, including bison, and 100 yards from wolves and bears. Read More: Where did wolves become dogs?

"A judge rejected Obama’s plan to give overtime rights to workers making less than $47,000.  A federal judge has blocked a new Department of Labor regulation that would have made millions of   workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule was scheduled to take effect on December 1 and it was expected to be a key part of President Barack Obama’s economic legacy.    The law gives workers making less than $47, 476 a right to     overtime pay. The old rule had applied only to workers making less than $23, 660 per year. But Amos Mazzant, a federal judge in Texas who was appointed by President Obama just two years ago, has called the rule’s future into question. It’s just a preliminary ruling, but Mazzant’s opinion strongly suggested that he would ultimately hold that the Labor Department’s new rule was illegal. Labor rights groups blasted the ruling. “Workers will continue to work longer hours for less pay thanks to this obstructionist litigation,” said Christine Owens of the National Employment Law Project in an emailed statement.    Because the ruling overturns a regulation that was generally seen as giving workers more rights, it has been cheered by business groups. But ruling could lead to an outcome that’s not great for anyone. If nothing else, Obama’s rule  —   that everyone making less than $47, 476 was entitled to overtime pay  —   had the virtue of simplicity. Employers would have grumbled, but at least it would have been crystal clear who was affected.    But now it looks like the Labor Department could be forced to adopt a more complicated rule that focuses on the specific details of each worker’s job. That’s going to force employers to spend more money on lawyers to figure out who is eligible for overtime. At the same time, it will make it harder for employees to figure out when their bosses are breaking the law. A judge says the law doesn’t allow a   rule Modern labor law dates back to 1938, when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act. A key requirement of that law was that workers receive     pay any time they’re asked to work more than 40 hours per week.    Still, lawmakers understood that this requirement didn’t necessarily make sense for people in management, administrative, and professional positions who typically enjoy high levels of autonomy on the job. Managers and professionals are typically   and have a fair amount of bargaining power, so there was less reason to worry about them being exploited on the job. And they typically don’t punch a time clock. So Congress said that the overtime rule would not apply to “any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity. ” And it put the Labor Department in charge of defining who qualified as an exempt employee under these rules. Early versions combined salary thresholds with tests that focused on a worker’s specific job duties. In 2004, the Labor Department simplified the rule and placed a greater emphasis on the salary requirement. Workers making an annual salary higher than $23, 660 could generally be considered exempt from the overtime requirement, while workers making less than that had to be paid overtime.    The Obama administration wanted to double that threshold so that anyone making less than $47, 476 will be guaranteed overtime pay. But Mazzant ruled that the Labor Department’s entire approach is a misreading of the law. “Congress intended the exemption to apply to employees doing actual executive, administrative, and professional duties,” he wrote. Instead, the Labor Department effectively defined the rule to apply to an anyone paid more than $47, 476. “The [Labor] Department has admitted that it cannot create an evaluation based on salary alone,” Mazzant wrote. “But this significant increase to the salary level creates essentially a de facto   test. ” “The Department estimates 4. 2 million workers currently ineligible for overtime will automatically become eligible without a change to their duties,” Mazzant noted. “Congress did not intend salary to categorically exclude an employee with executive, administrative, and professional duties from the exemption. ” The ruling represents a significant change in how employment law has traditionally been interpreted. While earlier versions of the law did include criteria beyond salary, salary has long been treated as the primary criteria for deciding whether a worker could be exempted from overtime requirements. Mazzant’s ruling not only calls the new $47, 476 figure into question  —   it could force the Labor Department to reconsider the whole concept of using a salary threshold to determine who is entitled to overtime. And whatever its flaws, the salary threshold has at least one big advantage: It’s clear and objective. It’s easy to tell whether or not a particular worker is being paid more than $47, 476. In contrast, a rule that determined a worker’s status based on details of his or her job duties could make things more complicated for everyone. Employers would need more legal advice, and workers would face greater uncertainty about whether employers were breaking the law by classifying them as executive or professional workers.    Obama’s overtime rule was probably doomed anyway Even before Mazzant’s ruling, there was reason to doubt that the new overtime rule would survive the Trump administration. Republican members of Congress have been criticizing the rule all year, and those same lawmakers quickly praised Tuesday’s ruling.   Good news for #Arizona businesses that have been forced to comply   onerous fed’l reg: ”Judge blocks overtime rule” https:  .  —   John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) November 23, 2016    If Hillary Clinton had won the White House, she would have likely appointed a Labor Secretary who would have looked for a way to revive Obama’s overtime rule. In contrast, whoever Donald Trump chooses as secretary of labor is unlikely to have much interest in expanding overtime protections. So if Judge Mazzant’s ruling is upheld on appeal, the Trump administration is likely to quietly adopt a rule that gives employers broad discretion to classify its employees as exempt  —   and therefore ineligible for overtime. And even if appeals courts reject Judge Mazzant’s reading of the law, the Trump administration can still roll back Obama’s rules.

(Bill O’  Washington Post)  President Obama and the first lady reported a combined income of $436, 065 on their 2015 tax returns, nearly a 10 percent dip from the previous year and the lowest amount since the president took office. The Obamas paid $81, 472 in taxes, for a federal tax rate of 18. 7 percent, the White House reported Friday in its annual disclosure. The federal income tax filing deadline is Monday. The first familymade about $41, 000 more in 2014, but the Obamas’ income has fallen since peaking early in his tenure at $5. 5 million, buoyed by earnings from his two books, ”Dreams From My Father” and ”Audacity of Hope.” This year, the Obamas reported donating $64, 066 to 34 charities, including the largest gift of $9, 066 to the Fisher House Foundation, which offers   housing to military families during illness, disease or injury. Vice President Biden and his wife, Jill, reported a combined income of $392, 233, and paid $91, 546 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 23. 3 percent, the White House said.       ",-0.5
"Britain, E.U. are at odds over timing of exit.   BERLIN  —   British Prime Minister David Cameron came under intense pressure Saturday from stunned continental diplomats to begin the painful process of extracting his nation from the European Union, as political aftershocks rocked both sides of the English Channel following Britain’s historic vote to leave. After a tumultuous Friday that saw world financial markets plummet and Cameron announce his intention to resign, British voters and their European peers began on Saturday to digest the full and enormous consequences of the isles’ historic decision to break with Europe. In Berlin, foreign ministers from the six original members of the E. U. spoke with one voice, effectively telling the British that now that they have decided, there should be no delay to the exit door.  [The latest developments on Brexit]  Cameron has sought a looser timetable to give his Conservative Party a chance to choose his successor, whose task it would be to fashion a withdrawal deal over the course of two years. But technically, negotiations can’t even start until Britain triggers the bloc’s Article 50  —   the    mechanism to leave it. Cameron has given no indication of pulling that lever fast. But for European officials stung by the vote, patience was wearing thin.      “We start now,” French Foreign Minister   Ayrault told reporters in Berlin. “We must be clear. The British people have decided after an initiative that was taken by Mr. Cameron. That was, is his responsibly. ” At the same time, deep intrigue reminiscent of ancient European power plays using knights and swords instead of the ballot box swirled over the future of Scotland. Scottish voters, unlike the English or Welsh, voted on Thursday to remain in the E. U.  —   and Scotland’s cabinet met in Edinburgh to consider its next steps. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, confirmed that the party would begin efforts to seek a new vote on independence, a move that eventually could bring another wrenching change to an island nation that is now operating without a clear road map. The “cabinet agreed that we will seek to enter into immediate discussions with the E. U. institutions and with other E. U. member states to explore all possible options to protect Scotland’s place in the E. U.,” Sturgeon said Saturday.  [Who could be next?]  During Scotland’s referendum for independence from Britain in 2014  —   which failed  —   E. U. officials were circumspect, saying at the time that Scotland would have to get in line with the likes of Serbia and others who also wanted to join their club. If that position changes swiftly into an opportunistically strong pledge of membership now, it could drive an even deeper wedge between England and the continent. Yet already, some E. U. politicians said that if Scotland extends a hand, the E. U. should take it  —   suggesting the potential tug of war ahead for Scottish loyalties between London and Continental Europe.     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit View Graphic     Meet the European leaders hoping to cause the next Brexit  “If Scotland wants to be a member of the European Union as an independent country, then they are welcome,” said Manfred Weber, the chair of the European Parliament’s   European People’s Party and an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “But that’s up for them to decide. That shows that there are positive signals. Some people do want to be members of the European Union. ” Britain could undergo even further dismantling if the Nationalists in Northern Ireland, which also voted to remain in the E. U. press ahead with their calls for a vote on Irish reunification. Already, signs at the main post office in Belfast warned all who entered that it had already run out of applications for passports from Ireland. In the tumult, Jonathan Hill, Britain’s European commissioner, announced his resignation Saturday, citing his disappointment at the outcome of the referendum vote on Thursday. His departure as Britain’s most senior official in Brussels was expected, but nonetheless was another reminder of how the vote Thursday is quickly shrinking the country’s role in European affairs. Britain’s leaders have sought to offer reassurances that the Thursday vote, which carried by 52 percent to 48 percent, would be dealt with in a calm, orderly fashion. But behind the scenes in Britain on Saturday, there was a flurry of crazed political activity. As Britons fretted over the consequences of their decision, a petition for a second referendum  —   considered a long shot for myriad reasons  —   garnered more than 2 million signatures. Leading Conservative Party politicians began maneuvering to replace Cameron. Boris Johnson, the flamboyant former mayor of London and a leader of the “leave” campaign, is considered the favorite, but likely will face serious opposition. Since the vote, Johnson too has urged a   approach to negotiations to withdraw from the E. U.  —   a marked change from his stark  . U. rhetoric during the campaign and perhaps a sign that those who had championed breaking with Europe were chastened by what now lies ahead. The referendum has also roiled the opposition Labour Party, with its leader Jeremy Corbyn confronting an open revolt from those who say he failed to campaign hard enough to stay. Senior party members have filed a motion of no confidence, threatening to make him one more victim of the Brexit fallout. But Corbyn signaled Saturday that he would not go without a fight. Asked by a reporter during a central London event whether he would run again for party leader if there were new elections, he replied: “Yes, I’m here. Thank you. ” Cameron, in announcing his resignation, said he would stay through the transition to a new government but did not think he should lead Britain as it charted its new course independent of the E. U. leaving that to the next prime minister, hopefully chosen by October. However, pushing back against such a leisurely timeline were the top diplomats from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, issuing a joint statement Saturday that called for a start of exit talks “as soon as possible. ” Their fast meeting underscored the continental effort taking shape to prevent further disintegration of European unity in the wake of the British decision. German Foreign Minister   Steinmeier echoed calls for quick talks, warning of the risks of a   quagmire. “We understand and respect the result and understand that Great Britain now concentrates on Great Britain,” Steinmeier said. But, he added, “this process should begin as soon as possible, so that we don’t end up in a long stalemate but are able to concentrate on the future of Europe and work on it. ”  [European power suddenly shrinks]  Two camps appeared to be lining up, however. Some European diplomats were eager to hold Britain’s feet to the fire for leaving  —   seeking a tough deal that would dissuade other member states from seeking similar referendums to leave the bloc. But Steinmeier, as well as Merkel, who will be instrumental in the exit talks, were, at least publicly, staking out a position that made Germany the adult in the room. Earlier Saturday, Steinmeier told Germany’s ZDF television that Europe should “not go looking for revenge. ” Speaking in Potsdam, Germany, Merkel sounded resolute but patient. “To be honest, it shouldn’t take forever,” she said of Britain’s exit. “But I wouldn’t fight over a short period of time. ” She added, “Great Britain has to say what kind of relations to the European Union it’s envisioning in the future, and then we, the 27 member states, need to decide to what extent we can fulfill these expectations and what is in our interest. ” The rounds of diplomacy were laying the groundwork for an E. U. leaders summit on Tuesday, when the heads of the   bloc will convene to begin discussing what could be a highly messy, even ugly, British exit. The next day, the 27 national leaders excluding Cameron are scheduled to huddle among themselves. Yet many leaders, including the key foreign ministers meeting Saturday, have also conceded that to some extent, the E. U. also needs to offer a mea culpa. The union needs, they said, to respond to widespread public criticism and antipathy among European voters beyond Britain who think it has become too remote and has failed to deliver on key issues including migration, security and job growth. For Europe, Steinmeier described the British vote as a   call. “It is apparent that Europe needs to deliver solutions the people are asking for,” he said.

"HBO Takes A Radical Leap Forward With 'Random Acts of Flyness'. What would a more liberated vision of TV look like? Atlanta, Pose, and Killing Eve have certainly helped inch us toward an equitable television democracy, one that doesn’t so easily submit to the status quo. They’re visionary experiments that reject the neat parameters of yore—narratively, thematically, representationally. But there’s still a sizable amount of ground to cover before boundaries aren’t just pushed, but broken. One novel addition helping to expedite this artistic re-centering is HBO’s Random Acts of Flyness, a variety series developed by Dallas-born creative polyglot Terence Nance (he writes, directs, and acts in the six-episode series) that explores race, politics, and the dimensions of selfhood with a critical and curious eye. In the lead up to the show’s release last week, the New York Times wondered “Is America Ready for the Mind of Terence Nance?”; via Twitter, the show responded: “We think not.” Whether or not America is ready is irrelevant; historically, Hollywood’s embrace of the black avant-garde has registered with marginal strides at best. Regardless, Random Acts is here, having landed with a jolt of wonder and relief, and now joins a spate of projects—Sorry to Bother You, Get Out, Black Panther—that attempt to situate, and wrestle with, black futurity. Per the show’s tagline, it aims to “shift consciousness.” But just what is Nance trying to teach us? https://twitter.com/RandomActsHBO/status/1026574079799828482 The series is not so much a dive into the mind of black identity as much as it is an exodus out of the mind, deciphering what Nance describes in the show’s introduction as the “beauty and ugliness of contemporary American life.” ",0.0

"Sadistic students busted for ‘pure evil’ animal-killing contest. Sadistic British college students were kicked off campus for butchering a fox, a badger and cat in a sick contest to kill the largest animal, according to a report Friday. A “pure evil” video shows students at Hartpury College in Gloucestershire slashing a baby fox’s throat and stomping its scull in the cruel game,  “Got the f —  ker,” a female student brags in the Snapchat footage. A helpless pet cat and a wild badger were also butchered in the disturbing competition  —   which students at the agricultural school bragged about on social media, according to the site. The feline, which belonged to two college employees, was found dead in a hedge and police are investigating, according to the Telegraph. Some students were outraged, slamming the school for not punishing students earlier. “This case could have been prevented if action was taken and it had not been brushed under the carpet,” the student raged. “Totally unacceptable. You have been given details of this sick game that the students are playing by both staff and students and have not supported any of your witnesses,” the student said. She added, “Really ashamed to have been associated with this college. ” Another student claimed the initiation ritual has been going on at the school for at least a year and a half. “There’s a sick game going on between students. Dares. Initiations,” the student said. “Animals were killed when I went there years ago, nothing was done. The college is not  strict enough. ” One student was expelled in connection to the cat’s death and others were suspended, a school official said. A spokesman for the college called the fox video “distressing and unacceptable. ” “There have been suggestions that this incident is related to an earlier incident involving the death of a cat,” the spokesman said. “We can confirm that the student involved in the earlier incident has been expelled from the college. ” But the school has not found “evidence to suggest the incidents are related,” he said. He added, “These incidents do not, in any way, reflect the behaviors and beliefs of the college, our students, staff and graduates. ” Hartpury College teaches animal care, dog grooming and equine studies.",1.0
"Donald Trump’s bogus claim that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.      “In addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ”  —     Donald Trump, in a tweet, Nov. 27 Angered by demands for a recount in the three states that gave him an electoral college victory,   Donald Trump made a bold but unsubstantiated assertion in a tweet  —   that “millions of people” voted illegally in the presidential election. He suggested they voted for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who now leads in the popular vote by 2. 2 million votes, and thus he actually also won the popular vote.

But losing the popular vote by such a substantial margin apparently gnaws at Trump. Is there any basis for his claim? The Facts The simple answer is no. This is a bogus claim with no documented proof. Our colleagues at Snopes. com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the   blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U. S. president.

One article described Phillips as being affiliated with VoterFraud. org but in reality he says he is the founder of VoteStand. com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the “biggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world” because it provided opportunities for voter registration. In any case, Phillips made this claim  —   and then has declined to provide any evidence to back it up, even though reporters have asked:   @tynanwrites @TrueTheVote  No. We will release it in open form to the American people.

Among other things, he falsely asserted that illegal immigrants were tipping the results in elections, based on a misinterpretation of disputed data. Even the researcher who produced the data said Trump was taking his findings out of context: “Our results suggest that almost all elections in the U. S. are not determined by   participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions. ” A representative of the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for evidence of Trump’s claim.

"3 reasons liberals will be frustrated if Clinton’s pick for vice president is Tim Kaine.      Sen. Timothy M. Kaine ( .) is one of a few people that Hillary Clinton is considering as a potential   candidate. On the one hand, Kaine is the kind of moderate Democrat who would make a sensible, prudent choice for a presidential candidate looking for a running mate in a hotly contested general election. On the other hand, the Democratic Party has shifted to the left in recent years, putting Kaine’s centrist positions on several major issues out of line with the direction of the party. Here’s a look at where Kaine stands on three of those questions. Trade Kaine supports President Obama’s international trade deal, known as the   Partnership, and voted to give the president special authority to negotiate the agreement. ”I see much in it to like. I think it’s an upgrade of labor standards. I think it’s an upgrade of environmental standards. I think it’s an upgrade in intellectual property protections,” the former governor of Virginia told The Intercept this week, adding that he has concerns about other aspects of the accord, specifically regarding how disputes between companies and foreign governments would be resolved.    Sen. Tim Kaine ( .) is Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential candidate. Here’s what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass, Osman   Washington Post)   Clinton supervised the negotiations of the   Partnership as Obama’s secretary of state and supported the deal at the time. Recently, though, she has said she opposes the final version of the agreement. ”I did say, when I was secretary of state three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard,” Clinton said last year. ”In looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards, my standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans.” Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s unsuccessful rival in the Democratic primary, also opposes the deal, as does Donald Trump, her GOP opponent. Banking Kaine says he supports the   Act, the comprehensive and complex financial reform that Congress passed in 2010. At the same time, Kaine has argued for less stringent regulations on some aspects of banks’ operations, and he subscribes to one of the chief conservative critiques of the reform. Specifically, Kaine agrees with many opponents of the   Act that the rules are placing undue burdens on local and regional banks. ”It’s important you don’t treat every financial institution the same,” Kaine told The Washington Post. “It wasn’t credit unions that tanked the economy. It wasn’t local community banks that tanked the economy.” On Monday, Kaine signed a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, calling on the agency to ”tailor” regulations to focus on larger institutions. The senator also signed a second letter to Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, and other officials asking them to allow banks to report their liquidity once a month instead of every day. Liquidity is a measure of a financial institution’s ability to pay its debts in the short term. When investors and depositors lose confidence in a bank’s ability to make good on its obligations, the result can be a run on the bank. From the perspective of liberal reformers, regular reporting is crucial to ensuring the stability of the financial system, since a run can develop in just a few days. Abortion Kaine’s position on abortion is complicated. Like Vice President Biden, Kaine describes himself as a Catholic who opposes abortion on account of his faith. He has supported the Hyde Amendment, which bars Medicaid patients from using federal funds to pay for abortions. He has also supported requiring parental consent for mothers seeking abortions, and as governor of Virginia, he allowed drivers to put license plates with the words ”Choose Life” on their cars. At the same time, Kaine has voted against bills to defund Planned Parenthood, and he supports the Supreme Court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade. ”I have a traditional Catholic personal position, but I am very strongly supportive that women should make these decisions and government shouldn’t intrude,” Kaine told CNN last week.

"With the first two states in danger, Clinton goes on the attack against Sanders.   AMES, Iowa  —   A newly aggressive Hillary Clinton emerged here this week and her campaign took on fresh urgency as polls suddenly showed the Democratic presidential   in real danger of losing the first two primary contests to insurgent rival Bernie Sanders. Here in Ames, Clinton launched her sharpest attacks yet by ripping into Sanders on issues such as health care and gun control. She portrayed the senator from Vermont as naive and his proposals as unrealistic  —   and, seeking to undermine the central argument of his candidacy, alleged that he could not be trusted to take on entrenched interests. “If you’re going to go around saying you’ll stand up to special interests, well, stand up to the most powerful special interest  —   stand up to that gun lobby,” Clinton said, citing Sanders’s 2005 vote to grant immunity to gun manufacturers. “Don’t talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers,” she added. “I’ve got the scars to show for it, and I’m proud of every single one of them. ” Later Tuesday, the campaign released a new ad in which Clinton doesn’t mention Sanders by name but implicitly criticizes him by saying “it’s time to pick a side”  —   with or against the gun lobby. “I’m with him,” Clinton says of Obama, suggesting that Sanders is not.    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addresses cheering supporters at a rally at the Des Moines Area Community College in Ankeny, Iowa, on Sunday. (Scott  )  Although Clinton and Sanders have been tweaking each other since the fall, the Democratic contest has been a sleepy affair compared with the rollicking Republican race. But it is coming to life ahead of a debate Sunday, the last before the Feb. 1 caucuses here. Clinton has seemed this week to relish playing the aggressor in what she has dubbed the “let’s get real” period of the race. Sanders has been drawing contrasts, too, ticking off differences with Clinton on Social Security, energy and other policies at his rallies. Clinton’s combative approach is part of a broader effort by her campaign and her allies to blunt Sanders’s apparent momentum. Her campaign has begun flooding Iowa and New Hampshire with a wave of surrogates that includes her husband, former president Bill Clinton; their daughter, Chelsea; Lena Dunham, the star of the HBO series “Girls”; and a troupe of female senators.  [Clinton is vulnerable in Iowa. But she may be invincible in the end.]  Clinton has also rolled out major endorsements this week designed to highlight her differences with Sanders on gun safety: Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who survived a 2011 assassination attempt in Arizona, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The former secretary of state has tried to highlight her perceived electability, her ability to withstand Republican attacks in the general election and her readiness to occupy the Oval Office. She recalled at length in Ames her time in the White House Situation Room during the Osama bin Laden raid  —   “one of the most tense days of my life,” she said. Campaign officials said they long expected the race to be close, and her organization is designed for a protracted battle well past the Super Tuesday contests in March. In Iowa specifically, the Clinton team is confident that its organizational muscle and   strategy will prevail.   Stump speeches by GOP presidential candidates reveal that they’re planning for a race against Hillary Clinton in the general election. (Peter   Washington Post)   “Since the campaign started, we have said this race will be a competitive, tough race that would tighten and we’d have to earn the nomination,” spokesman Jesse Ferguson said. “We have built a tremendous   organization in Iowa fueled by enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton and her record that is set to compete and win. ” In New Hampshire, Sanders enjoys a   advantage as a neighboring senator and has been tied or leading in the polls for months. But he is showing new strength in Iowa, where Clinton’s lead appears to have vanished, and is also catching up in national surveys. A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday showed Clinton trailing Sanders here, 49 percent to 44 percent.  Despite Clinton’s frequent visits, army of   organizers and early investment in TV advertisements, she does not appear to have captured people’s imaginations the way Sanders has.  The crowds at his town hall meetings have swelled even beyond his campaign’s expectations. In high school gyms and community centers across the state, Sanders has been feverishly embraced by a mix of young and older voters in recent days. People wave   signs handed out by the campaign promising “A Future to Believe In,” and many leave saying they are excited about caucusing on his behalf.  [Hillary Clinton could win Iowa but still lose the battle of expectations]  Danniella Vajgrt, 33, said she had been leaning in Clinton’s direction but decided Sunday to caucus for Sanders after hearing him speak in Marshalltown. “I’m seeing all these things broken in this nation, and these are the things he wants to fix,” said Vajgrt, who works with   children and adults. Not everyone who attended the Sanders event at a roadside Best Western was ready to commit to him, however. Elly Mack, 62, a nurse, said she was moving his way, in part because of his sincerity, but she doubts he can win the nomination. “I’m pretty sure Hillary is going to be the candidate,” Mack said. “I like her experience, but I’m just not quite there. ” Even before Christmas, some top Clinton supporters here were growing nervous, both because of Iowa’s history of volatility in the closing weeks before the caucuses and because they saw Sanders as primed for a late surge. There have been hints of those qualms in recent fundraising appeals from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. “I’m not trying to be dramatic about this (I swear! I’m really not!) but there’s a situation developing in Iowa and New Hampshire that could change the course of this election,” he wrote last week. Clinton remains the favorite to secure the nomination, in part because of Sanders’s inability so far to make inroads with minority voters. But if she were to fall short in Iowa and New Hampshire, she would have to brace for a costly slog  —   and, should she prevail, risk entering the general election as damaged goods. “This is going to be a long nomination process,” said Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver. “There’s no knockout blow by either candidate at the beginning of this race. ” In some quarters of the Democratic firmament this week, there have been fresh signs of uneasiness with Clinton’s candidacy. Vice President Biden, who decided against a campaign of his own last fall, praised Sanders in a CNN interview Monday and said that while “no one questions Bernie’s authenticity” on income inequality, the subject was “relatively new for Hillary to talk about. ” “I never thought she was a prohibitive favorite,” the vice president said, adding, “Everything’s sort of coming down to Earth. ” The fluid state of play in Iowa brought uncomfortable flashbacks for Clinton, who finished in a crippling third place in the 2008 caucuses. In her Ames speech, she mused about how difficult it is for a president to implement his or her ideas in Washington, however wonderful they may sound on the campaign trail. It was an implicit dig at Sanders.  [Clinton and Sanders try to erode each other’s strengths in tightening race]  “I wish we could have a Democratic president who could wave a magic wand and say, ‘We shall do this, and we shall do that,’ ” she said. “That ain’t the real world we’re living in!” Clinton used a similar “magic wand” line in 2008 to go after  . Barack Obama, saying he was naive for thinking he could unite Washington. She is responding to the Sanders threat by trying to tap into the goodwill Democrats here still feel toward Obama, casting herself as his rightful heir and the dependable protector of his legacy. One of Obama’s Cabinet members, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, jetted to Waterloo on Monday to endorse Clinton. There, and again the next day in Ames, Clinton said Sanders’s   “Medicare for all”   proposal would jeopardize Obama’s Affordable Care Act by shifting   decisions to the states, many of which have Republican governors. Addressing a few hundred Democrats on the frozen campus of Iowa State University, Clinton mocked Sanders’s mantra of a “political revolution” and said, “If that’s the kind of ‘revolution’ he’s talking about, I’m worried, folks. ” Chelsea Clinton echoed her mother at a campaign stop Tuesday in New Hampshire, saying that “Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare” and “strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance. ” Sanders spokeswoman Arianna Jones said these attacks are “wrong. ” Though Sanders has not released the specifics of his   plan, Jones said it would provide health care to every man, woman and child, and save   families $5, 000 a year. At the Brown and Black Presidential Forum on Monday in Des Moines,   Jorge Ramos, a Univision news anchor, asked Sanders if he had noticed Clinton becoming more aggressive. “Yessssss,” the senator said, drawing out the word. “It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable today. ”   Wagner reported from Marshalltown, Iowa.

"How Trump can drain the federal swamp. Donald Trump has pledged to “drain the swamp,” but I wonder if he knows just how deep down the muck goes. Yes, he plans to close the revolving door between his administration and the lobbying firms of K Street, and that’s a good start. If you don’t do that, a top federal official is going to be paying way too much attention to the lobbying firm he expects will hire him after he leaves government, and that’s a legalized form of bribery. President Obama made a similar pledge, and as quickly backed away from it. He said that no administration official could leave government to take up a job as a lobbyist, but exemptions were given and end runs permitted until there was little left of the pledge. Trump proposes to up the ante, by extending the ban from Obama’s two years to five years. He’d also close some of the loopholes that permitted Obama officials to work in lobbying firms without registering as lobbyists. We need to go further, however, and extend the ban to congressmen and their staffers. About a third of the current former congressmen and senior staffers work in corporate government relations departments or as registered lobbyists, where they trade their government contacts in return for huge salary increases. The muck goes deeper, however, as I discovered in my own little battle with the bicycle mob of Alexandria, Va. The federal government offers states and local governments about $900 million a year for bicycle and pedestrian improvements, and a fair chunk of this goes for bicycle lanes and subventions for the Capital Bikeshare program, with its rental stations of red bicycles. With the feds providing as much as 90 percent of the money for some programs, it’s hard for a city to turn this down. In my case, the bicycle lanes were going to run down a very steep highway that saw 14, 000 cars and large trucks pass by each day. As safe alternate routes were available, it seemed the height of craziness, but what it had going for it was an energized   lobby group that had the ear of the city government. When not actually bicycling, members of the group seemed to live for meetings at city hall that ran for six or more hours, often past midnight. They had their votes, their hatred of cars  —   and more importantly, they had federal money on their side. The federal grant to the bicyclists had done three things. Through the bicyclists’ message (from “Cabaret”) that “tomorrow belongs to us,” it might have gotten some people on bikes for the first time. Second, by taking away   streets for bike lanes and parking spots for bicycle stations, it had done its bit to ban fossil fuels and save the planet. Third, it had created a local, progressive interest group and given them an in with city hall. And for the federal regulators who designed the programs, that was perhaps the most important thing of all. The bike program isn’t a big deal in itself. But littered throughout the federal government are scores of similar programs, aimed at empowering the community organizer, the village radical, the smarmy city councilman. And that’s what the new administration has to take on. You’ll see it in Education Department mandates, Energy Department programs and Transportation Department directives. You’ll see it in the   dollars Planned Parenthood receives in government funds, which makes it easier for it to shift money in political contributions to Democrats. What’s going to be needed are Trump appointees who are informed enough to know which programs are boondoggles for Democrats and who, moreover, are tough enough to zero them out. Right now all the   opportunists, the   lawyers, the mild young men in the Republican Party are sending in their resumes to the administration. Will people so skilled at the art of pleasing have the requisite grit?",1.0

"After police shot a black cop, the police chief made an alarming comment about racial bias.  On Sunday, a black undercover police officer came upon and engaged in a gun battle in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Soon after, he was killed  —   not by one of the assailants who started the gunfight, but by a fellow police officer, Lynh Bui reported for the Washington Post.    The terrible tragedy immediately brought up worries of racial bias: Did a police officer shoot the undercover, plainclothes cop during the tense gun battle because he was black? But Prince George’s County Police Chief Henry Stawinski suggested it’s not possible, the Post reported:  Stawinski said he was ”uncomfortable with the notion that” bias would be ”introduced to the conversation.” He later clarified his response to the question about whether there was any suggestion of racial bias in the exchange of gunfire. ”In those split seconds when lives are in danger and officers are engaging a deadly threat, there simply isn’t time to bring any biases into it,” Stawinski said. ”Hindsight is a luxury that no officer has in the midst of an ambush.”     The comments are alarming, because they get subconscious racial bias  —   a widely studied phenomenon also known as implicit bias  —   completely wrong. During   decisions, racial bias may in fact be the only factor that comes to mind: As a police officer reaches for his gun, aims for a target, and fires within seconds, the color of someone’s skin is one of the quickest references that a racially biased cop may draw on to decide whether to shoot.    This is not an unfounded concern: There is plenty of research to support these worries about implicit bias. Most people are at least a little racist, even if they don’t know it            As part of a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious ”dehumanization bias” against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes. Researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones with a history of using force on black children in custody.    In the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children ages 10 and older as ”significantly less innocent” than their white counterparts. ”Children in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,” Phillip Goff, a UCLA researcher and author of the study, said in a statement. ”Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.” Other research suggests there can be superhumanization bias at work, as well, with white people more likely to associate paranormal or magical powers with black people than with other white people. And the more they associate magical powers with black people, the less likely they are to believe black people feel pain.    Another study found people tend to associate what the authors call ”  names,” like DeShawn and Jamal, with larger, more violent people than they do ”  names,” like Connor and Garrett. ”I’ve never been so disgusted by my own data,” Colin Holbrook, the lead author of the study, said in a statement. ”The amount that our study participants assumed based only on a name was remarkable. A character with a   name was assumed to be physically larger, more prone to aggression, and lower in status than a character with a   name.” Implicit bias likely influences police shootings    Implicit bias can also contribute to greater use of force by police. Studies show, for example, that officers are quicker to shoot black suspects in video game simulations. Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor who conducted the research, said it’s possible the bias could lead to even more skewed outcomes in the field. ”In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,” he said, ”we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.”            Implicit bias helps explain one of the troubling disparities in America’s criminal justice system: Black people are much more likely to be shot and killed by police. An analysis of the available FBI data by Vox’s Dara Lind found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. Although the data is incomplete because it’s based on voluntary reports from police agencies around the country, it highlights the vast disparities in how police use force. To end these kinds of racial disparities, researchers say that people and police officers need to be aware they exist. Once they know of their own biases, after all, it could become easier to keep them in check. (Indeed, Prince George’s County previously told the Post that it planned to start an implicit bias program.) So the fact that Prince George’s County’s police chief was apparently unaware of how implicit bias works isn’t just alarming because it shows he’s potentially uninformed; it also could make it much harder to address and fix such biases in the future.

"Don't Cliff Jump Like a Dummy—Use Physics. I like to spend time outside when possible. On a recent adventure I took a couple of the kids to check out some trails near my mother's house. This particular place was pretty nice. It had a lake with some cliffs you could walk along. Note: Do not jump off the cliffs into the water—there is a $500 fine for that (at least that's what the sign said). As we were standing near the edge of one of these cliffs, my daughter said that it wouldn't be too bad to jump off—it's not that high. I was pretty sure it was higher than she thought it is. But I don't have to just guess; we can measure the height with just a rock, my phone, and physics. ",0.0

"Amazon’s “democratic” TV development process may have a sexist loophole.  On paper, it seems pretty reasonable that Amazon Studios asked Gilmore Girls creator Amy   to produce a pilot episode of her new show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, before handing over a   order. Pilots are a standard part of the TV development process, and Amazon loves to emphasize how it’s the only network in the business that asks for public feedback on the shows it’s considering before it goes ahead and produces a whole season of TV.     But Amazon has also handed plenty of series to established Hollywood names  —   including Woody Allen and Mad Men creator Matt Weiner  —   without ever seeing a second of footage. It’s also done so for men who’ve never really worked in TV before, such as Allen, Drive’s Nicolas Winding Refn, and The Hunger Games   Billy Ray.  With that context, asking   to make a pilot for Mrs. Maisel starts to feel a little less routine and a little more sexist.    is a seasoned showrunner with a distinctive style and a   fan base. Why wouldn’t Amazon try to lock her in as part of its team of talented creators, when the company has done the same for men who didn’t even have a pitch?     Amazon requires most of its showrunners to go through a typical pilot process  —   but not all of them             Amazon develops many of its TV shows via its Pilot Season program: Twice a year, the company produces several pilots and makes them available for public viewing. Then it decides which ones to pick up based in part on viewer feedback (though the final call will always come from the top, and some critics have suggested the process is more for show than anything else). Since its launch in 2013, the program has produced some popular   critically acclaimed shows, including The Man in the High Castle (2015) Diablo Cody’s One Mississippi, and Jill Soloway’s   Transparent (2013, via Amazon’s first iteration of the Pilot Season program).    But Amazon has also allowed select series creators  —   from Allen and Weiner to Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell and Ally McBeal creator David E. Kelley  —   to skip the pilot season process altogether, ordering series from them sight unseen. This kind of “  ” order is relatively rare in the TV industry, but sometimes a person’s past works and recognizable name are all a network needs to say, “We trust you  —   no pilot presentation necessary. ”  What’s weird in this case is that, like Weiner and Kelley,   is an experienced TV creator with a distinctive style and devoted fans  —   and unlike Allen and Russell, who had never created TV shows before Amazon hired them, she’s launched a hugely successful series in the past.    Gilmore Girls  —   a   show about a mother and daughter who live in a small New England town  —   ran for seven seasons from 2000 to 2007 and developed a rabid fan following. It remains so beloved that Netflix ordered a   revival of the series nearly a decade after it ended, and the project was one of the most highly anticipated TV series of 2016. Just this week, reports that there could be another round of Gilmore Girls sparked a whole news cycle of speculation and debates about the show and who Rory should end up with (#TeamJess).   As is true for most showrunners, not every series   has worked on became a hit. Her first show after Gilmore Girls, the 2008 comedy The Return of Jezebel James, was quickly canceled. And her 2012   dance dramedy Bunheads  —   while warmly received by former Gilmore Girls fans  —   wasn’t a huge ratings hit for ABC Family and only lasted one season. But it’s hard to fathom that Amazon wouldn’t want to work with   based on her recent Gilmore Girls momentum alone. The network has often awarded shows to men whose followings only occasionally reach the dedicated fever pitch of Gilmore Girls fanatics (not to mention that their fans skew more male than  ’s) and whose résumés contain plenty of dull or failed projects among the hits.     In fact, when the studio ordered a series from Allen in 2015, he didn’t even have a concept yet. “I don’t know how I got into this,” he said at the time. “I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin. ” That much became especially obvious once Amazon released Allen’s scattershot series Crisis in Six Scenes last September. But it’s also a pretty stark example of just how little Amazon cared about whether Allen was any good at making TV. (Amazon has not responded to Vox’s request for comment.) Amazon’s spotty record with women creators makes more sense within the context of Hollywood’s spotty record with women creators in general  Looking at this disparity between  ’s experience and those of her male colleagues, there are a couple of    moving parts to consider. First, there’s the reported    drama that unfolded in December when Amazon abruptly canceled its freshman drama Good Girls Revolt. Created by Dana Calvo, the perfectly decent 1960s period piece about women journalists trying to achieve equal pay was canceled only five weeks after its first season dropped on Amazon. There could be many reasons the show was canceled, but according to Calvo, there were no women involved in the decision.  And if you look at Amazon’s programming slate, the presence of female show creators such as Soloway and Cody are an exception rather than the rule. (Don’t be fooled by Sharon Horgan’s Catastrophe or Phoebe  ’s Fleabag; both shows are British comedies that Amazon imported rather than produced itself.) Even after achieving so much with Transparent, Soloway had to put her new show I Love Dick through Amazon’s pilot season. So despite the appearance that Soloway’s fiery “topple the patriarchy” speeches at the 2016 Emmys might signify, Amazon isn’t exactly brimming with women at its highest   levels. (Amazon’s major players in series decisions are studio head Roy Price and head of   and drama series development Joe Lewis.)     Then there’s the broader problem of women directors and writers having to prove themselves over and over again no matter how successful their past projects might have been. There’s even a term for it: Former LA Times writer Rebecca Keegan coined the phrase “Ishtar effect” in 2015 to describe this phenomenon after comedy writer Elaine May directed the notorious 1987 flop Ishtar and never directed again. Her   Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman  —   who had a say in the final cut of Ishtar along with May  —   continued on their merry ways to lengthy careers in producing and acting alike.  It’s an unavoidable fact that women who helm even a single lackluster project are far more often dismissed than men who do, no matter what the rest of their track record looks like. So while   created a TV show that became a bona fide phenomenon, the relative failures of Jezebel James and Bunheads may have negated her success in executives’ minds. It’s plenty likely that Amazon just wanted to get a closer look at The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a potentially ambitious comedy about a 1950s New York housewife learning how to do standup comedy. But the fact that   has to prove her worth when male showrunners with similarly spotty records  —   or no TV records at all  —   get free passes to do whatever the hell they want is, at the very least, worthy of a skeptical eyebrow raise.

"Pence once called Trump’s Muslim ban ‘unconstitutional.’ He now applauds a ban on refugees..          Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis stood directly behind their boss Friday, one man on each side, as President Trump announced an order that will ban half the world’s Shiite Muslims from entering the country for months. “I’m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States,” Trump said from his podium at the Pentagon. “We don’t want ’em here. ” Pence nodded along to the words. It was just over a year earlier when he had called Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States “offensive and unconstitutional. ” That was before Trump picked him as his running mate and won the election.   Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U. S. are offensive and unconstitutional.  —   Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015   Trump sat down after his speech, signed the executive order and handed it to Mattis  —   a retired general who six months earlier had said the mere suggestion of a ban on Muslims caused “great damage” to world order. Now, Mattis was defense secretary. He took the order and grinned while Pence started clapping. Like other Republicans, the two men’s condemnations of Trump’s words had evaporated as he drew closer to power  —   and as his original call for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” morphed into a nearly   order that does not mention Islam but temporarily bar visitors from seven   countries.   [12 Nobel laureates, thousands of academics sign protest of Trump immigration order]   One of those countries, Syria, had attracted Pence’s scrutiny even before a young Trump campaign waded into the issue in late 2015. He was one of more than two dozen governors who called for a suspension of Syrian refugees that year  —   as a civil war there fueled fears that terrorists would slip into the United States amid the wave of evacuees. But when Trump upped the ante in December  —   calling for a border ban on all Muslims “until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on”  —   Pence joined the immediate Republican backlash. Trump’s words may have been ”offensive” to Pence, but they were popular with others. After winning contest after contest in the spring primaries and turning his sights on the general election, Trump blasted Democrat Hillary Clinton for border policies that would “let the Muslims flow in. ”   Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and   let the Muslims flow in. No way!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016   A few months later, a taciturn retired general who had overseen all U. S. military operations in the Middle East felt compelled to speak out against Trump. The call for a Muslim ban was causing American allies to think “we have lost faith in reason,” Mattis told Politico last July. “They think we’ve completely lost it,” he said. “It’s sending shock waves through this international system. ” He and Pence were joined in displeasure by Republicans across the spectrum. By former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who said banning a religion “goes against everything we stand for,” and who echoes language by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and many others. Even Trump’s campaign eventually distanced itself from his rhetoric. “Donald Trump’s Contract with the American Voter,” released last October, mentions no Muslim ban, but rather “extreme vetting” and a halt on immigration “from   regions. ”   [What is an executive order? And how do President Trump’s stack up?]   And by late 2016, with prospects for White House jobs in the wind, some of Trump’s former critics went mum on the issue. A CNN host confronted Pence about his silence in October, long after he’d left the Indiana governor’s office to campaign as Trump’s running mate. “What he has said about women, about Mexicans, about Muslims matters,” the host said. “Now you are tacitly accepting those positions because you won’t speak out. ” “It’s not Donald Trump’s position now,” Pence said of the ban, according to CNN. He fell back on the campaign’s   language about   countries rather than Muslims. Trump’s secretary of state designate backed the president up at his confirmation hearing this month. “He does not support a   rejection of any particular group of people,” Rex Tillerson promised Congress. Sure enough, Friday’s executive order makes no mention of Islam. It bans any visitors from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States for any reason for three months, with broader restrictions on the refugee program.   [As Trump bars Syrian refugees, life in their camps is getting harder]   None of those seven countries make up more than a few percentage points of the global Muslim population, according to a 2009 Pew study, although together they contain the majority of world’s Shiite Muslim minority. And just before signing the order, Trump suggested to the Christian Broadcasting Network that religion was not far from his mind. Once he restarts the refugee program, Trump told the outlet, Christians fleeing war and terror in the Middle East would get priority over others. “They were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he said of Syria  —   failing to mention that far more Muslims have been killed or displaced in that civil war. Neither Pence nor Mattis have commented in public about the executive order after applauding its signing on Friday. But another compatriot from their days as Trump critics has offered his take. Ryan, who once called any Muslim ban   said in a statement Friday that “President Trump is right. ” “We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it’s time to reevaluate and strengthen the   process,” Ryan said. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said Trump handed the pen he used to sign the order to Mattis. He handed Mattis the order itself.

"Inside the bloody, painful wounds of war, with an enthusiastic guide.    Caitlin Flanagan is the author of “To Hell With All That” and “Girl Land. ” She is a contributing editor at the Atlantic.    In 2003, journalist Chris Hedges published a   book with a simple title and fathomless moral implications: “What Every Person Should Know About War. ” To begin reading the book  —   arranged as a series of simply stated questions and their spare, emotionally unweighted answers  —   was to be implicated by it. Among the questions asked and forthrightly answered: “What does it feel like to get shot?” “Will I be able to withstand torture?” “What will happen to my body if I die?”  Mary Roach  —   a reporter, humorist and   author of books that bring specialized scientific discovery to a popular audience  —   has, however unwittingly, produced a work that should sit beside Hedges’s on the shelf. Called “Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War,” it is the latest in an oeuvre that includes titles such as “Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal,” “Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void” and “Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. ” It brings the breezy, jokey, boosterish approach that fans have come to expect of her work to a dark new subject: how military scientists try to anticipate, prevent or mitigate the ravages of war  —   from debilitating injuries to violent death  —   on its combatants.  The tone is jarring, but the reporting is sound. At Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, she interviews a young man  —   a 2011 graduate of West Point  —   whose penis was blown off when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan. Like other forms of amputation, this kind of wound is increasingly common, as advances in battlefield medicine have made many previously fatal injuries survivable. (This type of injury may also be on the rise because enemy snipers have begun aiming for the crotch, with the intention of delivering a devastating physical and psychic wound.)  In the moments after the explosion, the young officer  —   who also lost a leg  —   desperately tried to get off the ground to check on his men; when he learned that they were all safe, he told a medic, “If my dick is gone, just leave me here. ” But they brought him home, and Roach meets him as he is awaiting surgery to reconstruct his urethra. She asks a therapist at the hospital about the divorce rate after this kind of injury, and the woman replies: “Divorce rate? How about suicide rate. ”  At a training facility for future corpsmen, located near Camp Pendleton, Calif. Roach slips and slides on the fake blood that pours out of fake wounds. Trainees desperately try to remember how to treat various types of trauma, while the combat soundtrack from “Saving Private Ryan” blares from speakers and a sergeant yells: “Who’s dying, people? Who’s most likely to die?” At one point, a corpsman confronted with a man whose fresh stump is spewing blood “like champagne in the locker room after a big win” blurts out to the man, “Are you okay?” Roach, who takes part in the exercises, undergoes a procedure called a “blood sweep,” in which a corpsman runs his hands down her back as she is lying on a gurney to make sure she is not bleeding from a wound he’s missed. “If you don’t happen to be wounded,” she tells us cheerfully, “blood sweeps feel lovely. ”  Roach’s dominant attitude toward what she discovers is enthusiasm  —   particularly for the macho and often handsome military men she encounters. She’s aflutter at a “virile, omnipotent Special Ops man”; at a “droll and adorable” public affairs officer; at a naval officer with buzzed hair and a tattooed wedding band who looks fabulously “hydraulic” in his wetsuit; even at the “glorious pectorals” of a serviceman’s corpse. She wants us to see her as a fun gal gamely poking around the big, exciting war machine and trying not to get in anybody’s way. When a Navy SEAL in Iraq tells her she ought also to visit troops in Somalia, she invites the reader to chuckle along with her at the thought: “Let’s picture it  —     American in her   comfort sandals and wheelie bag wandering the desert redoubts of the local   Affiliate. Yoo hoo! I’m looking for the Navy SEAL safe house?”  It’s hard to trust a reporter who “adores” military PR men and who writes a “grasping fan letter” to a source. Yet her descriptions of trauma injuries, and of the military’s evolving response to battlefield danger and wounds, are compelling and  . Midway through this odd book, with its crushes and cork sandals, its gaping horrors and bloodless military euphemisms, you begin to wonder: Is this what 15 years of war have done to us? Are we willing to look at our strange, ruined and ongoing enterprise only if we have a chipper tour guide and enough depth charges of gore to keep us entertained?  The final chapter recounts Roach’s visit to the morgue of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, a place she bizarrely finds less depressing than the    Wendy’s, Dover Liquor Warehouse and McDonald’s she had to drive past to get to it. Every military person killed in action is autopsied, the bodies arriving in the States with any lifesaving equipment  —   tourniquets or breathing tubes or IVs  —   still attached. For this is the service member’s final duty to the state: offering his or her body for a process called “Feedback to the Field. ” During an international video conference call, 80 people look at photographs of the warrior’s naked body  —   black bars appearing across the groin and eyes  —   to talk about what went wrong and what might be improved upon the next time corpsmen and surgeons confront such an injury. Only then, when the military is fully and completely done with him, is his body wheeled out of the morgue, through the locked doors that lead to the mortuary and his waiting family. “They don’t look real,” says a statistician who has a stack of photographs of the corpses; “they’re like dolls. ”  The chief pathologist is tired of answering reporters’ questions about the psychic toll of his job. “We’re doctors,” he tells Roach with perfect military logic, “and these are our patients. ”   Grunt The Curious Science of Humans at War By Mary Roach Norton. 285 pp. $26. 95 ",-0.5

It’s not uncommon for the party in the White House to have some disagreements with its own members in Congress. But if you take Trump’s campaign promises at his word, Republicans have fundamental disagreements with their incoming president on his proposals to spend billions on infrastructure, deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally and institute more protectionist trade policies. And the cracks on those issues are starting to show. Here are six areas where Republicans have given Trump’s agenda a lukewarm response. 1. Deportation      ”60 Minutes” aired the first extensive interview with   Donald Trump Nov. 14. Trump said up to 3 million people who are ”criminal” and undocumented could be deported or incarcerated. (CBS 60 Minutes)   Trump: ”What we are going to do is get the people that are criminals and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, a lot of these people, probably 2 million. It could even be 3 million,” he told CBS’s Lesley Stahl in a ”60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday. ”After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that you’re talking about, who are terrific people.” Ryan: ”We are not planning on erecting a deportation force,” he told Jake Tapper on Sunday’s CNN ”State of the Union.” ”Donald Trump is not planning on that.” (To that,   news site Breitbart. com  —   whose former chief will be a top strategist to Trump  —   blasted out an article declaring: ”Paul Ryan: No Deportations”)     Newt Gingrich: ”There are going to be substantial deportations. They’re called criminals,” the former House speaker and Trump ally told John Dickerson on Sunday on CBS’s ”Face the Nation.” ”I mean, 2 million people would be a lot of people to deport.”        Trump’s campaign surrogate Newt Gingrich, said Sunday, Nov. 13, that there will likely be ”substantial deportations” of undocumented aliens under the administration of   Donald Trump. (Reuters)   Kevin McCarthy: ”Well, I think it’s difficult to do,” the House majority leader ( .) said Sunday in response to a question by Fox News’s Chris Wallace on whether he’d get behind Trump’s proposal for mass deportations. 2. A border wall Trump: ”Yes.” (In response to a question by Stahl: ”Are you really going to build a wall? ”) Trump did say he’d accept some proposals circulating in Congress for some fencing: ”For certain areas, I would. But certain areas, a wall is more appropriate.” McCarthy: ”You have to put a wall, it could be all virtual with the UAV airplanes as well, but I think that is doable and one of the first things that needs to be done. The terrain is different, so you can’t always build in just a specific place, but you can protect it.” 3. Trade Trump: Has repeatedly said he’d like to renegotiate or rip up trade deals. And he has promised to establish tariffs in his first 100 days. Ryan: ”Well, I think there’s a better way of dealing with that particular issue,” Ryan said on CNN in response to a question about Trump’s tariffs plan. ”We think there are better ways of dealing with making American products and workers more competitive, and really it’s fixing our tax code.” 4. Term limits for members of Congress      During a rally in Colorado, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to introduce a constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on members of Congress. (The Washington Post)   Trump:  ”We’re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren’t happy about, but we’re putting on term limits,” he said on ”60 Minutes.”  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( . ): ”I say we have term limits now. They’re called elections. It will not be on the agenda in the Senate,” McConnell told reporters the day after the election. 5. Infrastructure spending Trump: ”We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none,” Trump said on ”60 Minutes.” During the campaign, Trump pitched a   $500 billion infrastructure plan. ”And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” Ryan: In September, Ryan indicated such a plan as proposed by Trump would be too expensive. ”We passed the biggest highway bill, the   highway bill, for the first time since the 1990s just a few months ago. That’s already in place at 10 percent above baseline spending on mass transit and highways.” McCarthy: McCarthy said on Fox News that ”there is a place we could find common ground with Republicans and Democrats” on infrastructure. But he seemed unable to explain how Trump’s infrastructure spending plan differs from President Obama’s 2009 stimulus. ”Obama never had infrastructure in his stimulus,” he said. (Infrastructure spending was a major part of Obama’s stimulus.) 6. Whether Republicans have a mandate Ryan: ”He just earned a mandate, and we now just have a unified Republican government. The opportunity is to go big, to go bold and to get things done,” he said in a news conference Wednesday. McConnell: ” I think it’s always a mistake to misread your mandate, and frequently new majorities think it’s going to be forever,” he told reporters Wednesday. ”Nothing is forever in this country.” Where Trump and Republicans are in agreement There are a handful of areas that Trump and Republicans seem genuinely in agreement on. They are: Obamacare: Trump wants to repeal it; Republicans want to repeal it. Trump wants to keep the parts of the law that allow people under the age of 26 to stay on their parents’   plans and that require insurance companies to insure people with preexisting conditions. It looks like Republicans do, too. Ryan on CNN said: ”We need to have a solution for people with preexisting conditions. In our plan is allowing younger people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents’ plan.” Secure the border: Republicans and Trump agree this is a priority, perhaps even before deporting immigrants in the country illegally. Trump on 60 Minutes: ”But before we make that determination, Lesley, it’s very important  —   we want to secure our border.” Ryan on CNN: ”We think that’s first and foremost. Before we get into any other immigration issue, we have got to know who’s coming and going in the country. We have got to secure the border.” Tax reform: Ryan’s top policy priority appears to be one of Trump’s as well. ”We’re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes,” Trump said. Steve Bannon: Trump tapped the controversial Breitbart chief Sunday to make him his chief strategist. On Sunday, Ryan said: ”I don’t know Steve Bannon, so I have no concerns. I trust Donald’s judgment.” On Monday in an interview with MSNBC, Trump’s incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Bannon is ”a force for good.” But on this key appointment, there is the potential for division between Republicans and Trump. Hill Republicans were effusive in their praise and congratulations Sunday for Priebus  —   currently the head of the Republican National Committee and a buddy of Ryan’s  —   getting the top job. But they were nearly silent on Bannon’s appointment.",-0.5
"Comey’s actions don’t show any Trump ‘obstruction’. The leaks about the Trump White House took a dramatic new turn with   about a conversation between the president and former FBI Director James Comey about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. Flynn was fired for failing to provide an accurate account of his Dec. 30 phone conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Thereafter the FBI began to look at Flynn’s ties to Russia. A few days after Flynn was fired,  . According to a memo Comey reportedly wrote shortly afterward, Trump suggested that the investigation be dropped. “I hope you can let this go,” the president told Comey. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. ” At first glance this brings back memories of Richard Nixon and the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox. After that happened, it was simply a matter of time before Nixon was forced to resign. Is that where we are, then? Not so fast. The White House immediately issued a denial. “The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey. ” That’s not a denial that a conversation about Flynn took place. It’s a denial that Trump asked Comey to end the investigation, which is how the headline writers have treated the story. Go back to Comey’s account of the conversation, and you’ll see that it’s at least as plausible to imagine a different sort of conversation, one much more benign. Something like, “I know you have to do your duty, Comey, but when you finish I hope you’ll find there’s nothing there. ” That’s consistent with Comey’s account of what Comey said next. “I agree [Flynn’s] a good guy. ” The best evidence that that’s what Trump meant and how Comey understood it is what happened next: Nothing. Comey didn’t say anything about shutting down the investigation. And he didn’t resign. If Comey had been ordered to stand down, I expect he would’ve quit. He didn’t  —   which suggests he didn’t think he had to abandon the investigation. Nor did he, it seems. Testifying before the Senate last week, acting FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe, a Comey loyalist and Democrat, said, “There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date. ” Before we rush to judgment, therefore, recall that false rumors have been squelched before. For example, based on anonymous sources, The New York Times has reported that Trump held up funding for the Russian investigation. However, this was debunked by McCabe. McCabe also rejected the idea that a special prosecutor was needed, as the FBI hadn’t been interfered with and would carry out the investigation scrupulously and thoroughly. So when you add it all up, what’s the most plausible takeaway? Clearly, Trump talked to Comey about Flynn. And Trump probably felt bad about having had to fire Flynn just a few days before. Their friendship goes back a ways, and Flynn was on the   to be Trump’s vice president. And just how serious were Flynn’s offenses? There was nothing wrong with him talking to the Russian ambassador, or with the new administration’s announced desire for a thaw in relations with Russia. The transcript apparently revealed that, at the end of the conversation, the ambassador asked about lifting sanctions against Russia. Flynn said that didn’t happen, then said he had forgotten about it. It wasn’t nearly as big a deal as Trump haters made it out to be. What’s frustrating about all this is the  ’ irrebuttable presumption Trump is a lying scoundrel. When that’s how you begin, you don’t need much by way of evidence to prove what you’ve assumed all along. The intemperate attacks on the president, the willingness to credit any rumor however fantastic, does nothing to make us want to believe Trump’s critics. There may be more to the story; I’ve gotten used to shoes dropping all over the place. But I have confidence that, should more facts emerge, they’ll not change things overmuch. In particular, I think that the FBI and all of the investigative tools Congress possess will give us the rest of the story  —   if there is more to it.",1.0
"The Largest Scientific Structure Ever Powers Up in Africa. This dish antenna rises seven stories above an ancient seabed in the Karoo, a remote semidesert in South Africa. Later this year it will start scanning the universe for radio waves emanating from charged particles billions of light-years away, probing some of science's deepest questions: Was Einstein right about gravity? What are the origins of magnetism? Are we humans alone? The 50-foot-wide dish, though, will have friends. It's among the first of up to 3,000 dishes that will eventually spread from South Africa into eight additional African countries. That spiraling array of mid-frequency dishes will join up to 1 million much smaller low-frequency antennas planned for Australia. Combined, they'll form a single observatory called the Square Kilometre Array, the largest scientific structure on the planet, to gather 10.8 million square feet of radio waves. Unlike visible light, radio waves can reveal phenomena like hydrogen ionized in the early days of the universe, pulsars orbiting black holes, and maybe even alien signals. But detecting those long, frail frequencies requires a monstrous instrument, and dish antennas top out around 1,600 feet in diameter. So engineers build sprawling arrays to simulate much bigger telescopes. When complete, SKA will be 1,800 miles wide, and it'll see 50 times as much detail as the Hubble Space Telescope and record electromagnetic radiation up to a quadrillion times weaker than what your cell phone emits. SKA was dreamed up over beers at a conference in 1990. Some 1,500 engineers have worked on it since. But it took until 2011 to form the 13-country consortium that'll fund the project and share its data. Collaboration, says director-general Philip Diamond, is SKA's biggest challenge. “I sometimes spend more time being a diplomat and firefighter than a scientist.” The first phase of construction, expected to end in 2027 and cost nearly $1 billion, will erect 133 dishes. On each, incoming waves will bounce off the reflector to a 16-foot subreflector that focuses them onto receivers. Each second, 8.8 terabytes of data will fly down fiber-optic lines to a main supercomputer. The timeline for phase 2? “It's something for my successor to pursue,” Diamond says.

"The mess surrounding Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and reporter Michelle Fields, explained.  Donald Trump’s campaign manager will not be prosecuted, after Florida police charged him with battery for grabbing a reporter at a campaign event last month.    While Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields still has the option to press defamation charges, a Florida judge has decided Corey Lewandowski’s case will not be pursued further, Politico reported. Trump’s campaign manager Lewandowski was served with a notice to appear from the Jupiter, Florida, Police Department last month after Fields filed a criminal report that he ”manhandled” her at a campaign rally in early March. Trump has stood by his campaign manager despite Fields’s claims, a surveillance video corroborates her story, and a police report that had charged Lewandowski with battery.    ”The easiest thing: ’Corey, you’re fired!’ I can’t do that,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Wisconsin Tuesday. ”I can’t destroy a man for that.”    In fact, Trump supported Lewandowski since the accusations first surfaced. First he denied it ever happened. Then he denied the video footage existed. Then he said the video footage showed nothing. And then argued that Fields prompted the whole thing by first grabbing Trump while holding a pen (which Trump says Secret Service could have easily mistaken for a tiny bomb). Jupiter police also released the video they reviewed before charging Lewandowski, published by Talking Points Memo:       Lewandowski has come under a lot of scrutiny since the incident and is undoubtedly happy it reached this conclusion. (You can read more about him and the scandals surrounding him here.) ”Corey Lewandowski is gratified by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge and appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and his staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump’s loyalty and the support of his colleagues and family during this time. The matter is now concluded,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement in light of the news. But how Trump responded to the whole thing was an example of a campaign tactic he has used all along: Even in the face of overwhelming evidence contradicting contradicting his statements, he does not back down and he definitely does not apologize.    And while politicians are notorious for ducking the truth and skirting apologies, Trump’s campaign has taken it to another level  —   where photographic evidence and violence is not enough to change his tune. Trump’s case for Lewandowski so blatantly denied evidence that it was hard to argue against The Trump campaign was ”completely confident [Lewandowski] will be exonerated,” according to a statement released to Politico reporter Hadas Gold:   Trump Camp statement on Corey Lewandowksi charges pic. twitter.   —   Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) March 29, 2016    This statement was only the start. Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson pledged full support for the campaign manager adding, without hesitation, that Lewandowski would stay on with the campaign even if convicted. Then Trump began tweeting his take on the evidence: that ”nothing” questionable happened.  Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at   there!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016     The ”nothing” quickly transformed into what will undoubtedly be part of Lewandowski’s defense of the incident, when Trump tweeted that Fields prompted the campaign manager’s aggressive response by grabbing him to ”shout questions” at him.     Victory press conference was over. Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? pic. twitter.   —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2016     Trump pushed this story home throughout his campaign rallies in Wisconsin and during his town hall with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, where he said by Field’s account he might press charges as well. What is this whole thing all about? This all started at a Trump rally in Florida, where Fields stepped forward to ask Trump a question as he was trying to leave. According to Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, who was there and witnessed the incident, Lewandowski grabbed Fields and yanked her out of the candidate’s way. According to Terris, Lewandowski nearly knocked Fields over. Terris spoke with Fields immediately after the incident. She appeared shaken. ”I’m just a little spooked,” she told Terris. ”No one has grabbed me like that before.”    She took [Terris’s] arm and squeezed it hard. ”I don’t even want to do it as hard as he did,” she said, ”because it would hurt.” Fields recounted the incident in a post on Breitbart in her own words:  I wasn’t called upon to ask a question during the televised press conference, but afterwards Trump wandered around, stopping at every reporter to take their questions. When he approached me, I asked him about his view on an aspect of affirmative action. Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken. [. ..] I hope this article answers those questions and I can get back to reporting the news, not being a part of it.  She also sent a tweet that appears to show her arm was bruised:  I guess these just magically appeared on me @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump. So weird. pic. twitter.   —   Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 10, 2016     Politico obtained an audio recording of the incident, which reflected Terris’s account.    Breitbart became a chaotic mess Breitbart, the organization for which Fields worked at the time and has had a very   editorial policy, also published a story in which it openly disagreed with Fields’s characterization of the incident. Citing an extensive review of video footage, Breitbart said it appeared ”unlikely” that Lewandowski was responsible for roughing up Fields. Fields was suspended from her post at Breitbart and later resigned. Breitbart’s story was immediately questioned by skeptical journalists who accused the publication of trying to shore up its relationship with the Republican frontrunner. Breitbart CEO Larry Solov released a statement using skeptical language about the incident:  It’s obviously unacceptable that someone crossed a line and made physical contact with our reporter. What Michelle has told us directly is that someone ”grabbed her arm” and while she did not see who it was, Ben Terris of the Washington Post told her that it was Corey Lewandowski. If that’s the case, Corey owes Michelle an immediate apology.  However, Solov responded to the Trump campaign’s statement with more resolve, expressing disappointment for ”in particular their effort to demean Michelle’s previous reporting.”     . @BreitbartNews statement defending @MichelleFields & calling on @CLewandowski_ to apologize for grabbing her. pic. twitter.   —   Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) March 10, 2016  Breitbart’s newsroom spiraled into chaos after the allegations, resulting in not only Fields’s resignation but also the departure of other top editors. But the conservative media outlet was not wrong to be wary about what it says to the Trump campaign. After Solov named Terris as a source in his original statement, Terris, who said he had interviews scheduled with Lewandowski and the Trump team in his account of the incident, had his meetings canceled. Trump’s strategy is to go personal The campaign released statements suggesting that Fields’s motives in filing the report might be suspect. Campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said Fields has a history of ”becoming part of the news story.” Lewandowski jumped on board with the personal attacks, tweeting that Fields had previously ”accused” former US Congress member Allen West of groping her  —   citing a story run by Charles C. Johnson, whom Gawker once called ”the web’s worst journalist”:  Michelle Fields is an attention seeker who once claimed Allen West groped her but later went silent.  https:  .   —   Corey Lewandowski (@CLewandowski_) March 10, 2016  As Johnson himself says, Fields ”repeatedly and emphatically refused comment on the record” for his piece.    This is not the first time Trump and his campaign have gone after a perceived adversary on personal grounds.  The New York Times documented recently how the campaign has gone on the offense repeatedly through the campaign, using personal attacks to go after opponents, particularly using Twitter, as was the case against Fields:  With his enormous online platform, Mr. Trump has badgered and humiliated those who have dared to cross him during the presidential race. He has latched onto their vulnerabilities, mocking their physical characteristics, personality quirks and, sometimes, their professional setbacks.  The media has been a big target for Trump, who has been known to mock publications and networks during his rallies throughout the campaign. And he has made headlines for holding grudges against journalists, regardless of their publication’s partisan leanings (remember the Megyn   News feud that spanned several months). And this incident ate up much of the political news cycle in March. Read the full police report                     (via Mashable)  Donald Trump’s ideology of violence    ",-1.0
"Hair stylist to Marla Maples: No free services in exchange for Inauguration Day ‘exposure’.      Though Donald Trump and his family project an image of boundless wealth, a   hairstylist says the  ’s second wife tried to get out of paying her to style her tresses and those of her    daughter, Tiffany Trump, for Inauguration Day. Freelance stylist Tricia Kelly says she was contacted by a longtime client with ties to the Trumps about a job coifing Marla Maples and the younger Trump daughter for the big event. Kelly expressed her interest and she explained her rates  —   a $150 fee to travel in addition to the cost of her services  —   but Maples, through her assistant, balked. “I was told they had a $300 budget for both of them for hair and makeup,” Kelly says. After some back and forth, Kelly agreed to be paid $200 total and a makeup artist $150 to get the women  . That’s when Maples’s assistant came up with another proposal: Would Kelly and the makeup artist be willing to provide their services for free? In exchange, they would get “exposure,” and Maples would mention them on her   feeds, the assistant told her. Kelly declined. “I was stunned,” she said. “I told them . . . I work for a fee, not for free. ” For starters, she typically shuns such exposure of her work with political types, so as not to appear partisan, since her clients include prominent Republicans and Democrats. And Kelly, who says she typically prides herself on her discretion, was reluctant to speak out about the booking gone south. But in the end, disgusted at what she called “entitled” behavior, she decided to share her story publicly. “There are people who make far less than they do who pay full price,” she said. “People on staff  —   the incoming White House and the outgoing one  —   pay full price. It seemed like they were trying to see how much they could get for free based on their names. ” Accepting freebies isn’t illegal for Maples and Trump, ethics experts say. The president must report any “gifts” over $300 to him, his spouse and his minor children. But neither Maples nor Tiffany Trump is bound by those rules, says Jan Baran, an attorney who served on George H. W. Bush’s ethics commission. And it’s typical for Hollywood stars to accept loaned gowns and jewelry and even gifts and free services by people eager to be associated with celebrities (and seen by their millions of Instagram followers). But in official Washington, where lawmakers and other government officials are banned from accepting most giveaways, such arrangements are relatively rare. A spokeswoman for Maples declined to comment on this story. But after The Washington Post contacted the PR representative, Kelly received ominous messages from her client, who had first put her in touch with Maples’s camp. “You are messing with the president of the United States,” the Maples contact wrote her, adding that Maples was worried about her financial situation with Tiffany out of college, ending   payments from the  . “She is used to a certain lifestyle and you don’t understand that. ”      Donald Trump’s   child Tiffany is a    recent college grad.

"The NYT’s new columnist defends his views on Arabs, Black Lives Matter, campus rape.  On April 12, the New York Times’s vaunted editorial page got a new addition. Bret Stephens, formerly a columnist at the Wall Street Journal, will join Ross Douthat and David Brooks among the stable of   conservatives at the Gray Lady.    It’s a decision that infuriated many of the paper’s liberal readers. Stephens may be a vocal critic of Donald Trump, but his views are firmly  . In an interview on Sunday, his first since joining the Times, Stephens defended his view that fears of climate change are overblown, his argument that the campus rape epidemic is an “imaginary enemy,” and his belief that Black Lives Matter is sending the wrong message.  “Look, at the risk of being incredibly politically incorrect, but I guess that’s my job  —   I think that all lives matter,” Stephens said. “Not least black lives. ” The Times’s editorial page is a bit like the Supreme Court: Its opinions set the framework for the national debate, and its members tend to stay there for decades. So Stephens’s beliefs are about to have a big impact on the national discourse  —   even as his new employer sells newspapers by marketing itself as a leading vanguard of the   resistance.    A transcript of my interview with Stephens, edited only for length and clarity, follows. We spoke on Sunday after he delivered an address to the Jewish National Fund at a synagogue in Bethesda, Maryland.    Why Stephens is skeptical of the “college rape epidemic”            Jeff Stein You wrote one column for the Wall Street Journal about the imaginary enemies of the liberal mind, and one of the ones you named was the “campus rape epidemic”  —   Bret Stephens Focus on the word “epidemic. ” Jeff Stein You wrote, “If modern campuses were really zones of mass predation  —   Congo on the quad  —   why would intelligent young women even think of attending a coeducational school?”    My question to you is: Isn’t it necessary for women to attend these coeducational schools for their economic and educational advancement? Isn’t it possible that’s why they’d be there even if there’s a higher risk of sexual assault? Bret Stephens Of course it is.  But if sexual assault rates in, let’s say, east Congo were about 20 percent, most people wouldn’t travel to those places. Because that is in fact  —   or, that would be, in fact, the risk of being violently sexually assaulted. I am not for one second denying the reality of campus rape, or sexual assault, or behavior of the sort you saw from that swimmer at Stanford  —   that’s inexcusable and should be punished.    I’m taking issue with the claim that there is an epidemic based on statistics that, when looked at carefully, seem to have a very slim basis in reality. So what you’re transforming is horrendous, deplorable incidents into an epidemic  —   and that’s not altogether supported by reliable data. That’s the point I was making. I write my columns pretty carefully. I wrote about 550 columns for the Wall Street Journal, so I don’t know if I can stand behind every last jot and tittle of what I wrote.  Another example I took issue with is the idea that one in seven Americans are hungry. That’s not true. It’s not. It’s a problem because it’s not true. Does this mean there aren’t hungry Americans? No. Does this mean we shouldn’t care about hunger in America? No. But when you have a campaign you see on subway billboards and elsewhere saying one in seven Americans is hungry, that’s false. Jeff Stein That seems a little removed from the question I had, which was: Aren’t women’s incentives to go to college not predicated only the risk of sexual assault, and that to suggest otherwise —   Bret Stephens Right, they should go to institutions of higher learning. But I guess my point is this: The statistic that one in five women is sexually assaulted on college campuses is a highly dubious statistic.     If it were a true statistic, it would probably create a very different environment. My sister went to Mount Holyoke. I don’t think   education has been thriving in recent years, but there would be more of a movement to   education if in fact this epidemic were as epidemic as that statistic suggests. Jeff Stein You spoke in your speech this morning about Israel. Don’t Jews continue to live in Israel  —   despite the daily danger of a violent terrorist attack  —   precisely because of higher ideals and aspirations that call them there? Bret Stephens Yes, but what I would say is, first of all, that one in five Jews isn’t being murdered. One in, I don’t know, let’s say  000 Israelis actually runs a real risk of being a victim [of a terrorist attack]. I’m not making an argument against taking every single measure to prevent sexual assault on campus. What I am saying is that there [is] a collection of statistics which are essentially alarmist and statistically not   in facts. That’s my point. It’s not to say you shouldn’t go to campus. . .. I think there’s a dishonesty in these statistics, because you’re picking a misleading figure  —   you’re choosing, for instance, to characterize all unwanted touching as sexual assault, which clearly it isn’t. There are a variety of gradations between an unwanted kiss and a rape. You say, “This is the statistic: One in five women face sexual assault on college campuses,” and it gains currency. If that were true, I’d suspect intelligent women would say, “I’m not going to put myself in anything like this risk. ”    Stephens: I am not a climate denier            Jeff Stein This seems to be similar to what you’ve said on climate change  —   that there’s a set of what you think are dubious statistics leading to “alarmist rhetoric. ” Bret Stephens A guy I know just had a baby and he’s a big global warming, climate change activist. If he thinks in 20 years we’ll be heading toward unsustainable climates and there will be tens of millions of people being displaced, presumably including himself, at the most apocalyptic level, then presumably he wouldn’t be having children. It contradicts the belief that we are heading ineluctably for an apocalyptic environmental future. Since 1880  —   and I’d have to look it up  —   but according to the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] we’ve had about 1. 7 degrees of rising temperatures. The best scientific evidence suggests temperatures are rising, and the best scientific evidence suggests   anthropogenic carbon emissions have some substantial thing to do with that. However, does that mean the trend will continue forever? We don’t know. Does this mean we will reach the upper bounds of what climate scientists fear? We aren’t sure. There are uncertainties in all of this. If I say, “Hey, there are uncertainties about forecasting the future,” that ought to be  —   in any other context  —   a statement of common sense. But now if you say there are uncertainties, you are akin to what’s called “a denier. ”    I think that term is incredibly ugly, because it almost explicitly connects doubts about the severity of climate change  —   not the reality of it  —   to doubts about the existence of the Holocaust.    Jeff Stein If that’s your starting premise, does that mean you think there’s a great danger in overreacting to the danger it poses?  Bret Stephens Well, yes. The best argument made on behalf of climate mitigation strategies is even if there’s a small chance your house catches fire, you take out insurance. That’s perfectly sensible. And you can make a perfectly sensible argument that even if we’re not 100 percent sure we’re facing a catastrophic climate future, we should take out a host of insurance policies to mitigate carbon emissions. But then the intelligent question is: “How much are you paying for insurance?” Jeff Stein Are you saying we’re currently paying too much? Bret Stephens I’m saying that’s a question we ought to be raising. By the way, there are a whole host of environmental problems. We have limited resources. I am simply making statements of fact.  One environmental problem is malnutrition due to lack of micronutrients in the developing world. We have to devote some sets of resources to that. But if you’re going to say our pot as the wealthy world for dealing with environmental crises is $1 trillion a year, how much should go to climate mitigation strategies as opposed to providing micronutrients or dealing with malaria or  ?    And then you have to start making choices. You can’t just say, “Everything is connected to the climate; therefore the only way of dealing with it is devoting all of our resources to it. ” Jeff Stein So let’s get away from the hypotheticals. Within the American government as it currently exists, are we spending enough on climate mitigation? I don’t think anyone in the environmental movement would argue that the entire federal bureaucracy should be devoted exclusively to this problem. Sounds like a straw man. Bret Stephens But here, I guess, is a question: When you have a dire prognosis about what might happen, you then take steps that you then come to regret. My wife is German, so I know something about German energy policy. About 15 years ago, Germany opted to have an energy revolution where 30 percent of their energy needs would be met by wind and solar  —   most climate scientists would say, “That’s a great policy; they’re really leading the way. ” But it turned out that, in Germany, the sun doesn’t shine all the time. And, even in Germany, the wind doesn’t blow all the time. However, you need power all of the time; because you’re spending tremendous amounts on wind and solar subsidies, you need an alternative  . I’m just giving you an example. What is their solution to having a base supply? Coal. So now Germany is dirtier in terms of carbon emissions than it was at the beginning of this. I feel like some of the statements that have been made about the comments I have made are almost willful misreading things I have written. God forbid I should ever suggest rape and sexual assault are not serious subjects. I grew up in Mexico City; I know what it’s like to grow up in a filthy, polluted air space.    I’m saying let’s be careful with our terms, and genuinely truthful, and not necessarily alarmist. When we offer misleading statements in service of what appears to be a higher virtue, or higher goal, we run the risk of making very bad policy choices.  “The disease of the Arab mind”            Jeff Stein The column of yours that’s gotten the most attention since you were hired [at the Times] was one in which you wrote about “the disease of the Arab mind,” by which you meant  .  Bret Stephens That’s what the column said. The column was about the refusal of an Egyptian judoka during last summer’s Olympics to shake the hand of an Israeli athlete. Jeff Stein Couldn’t that have been due to his   animus rather than  ? Bret Stephens I used it as an occasion to talk about   in the Arab world. By any measure, the Arab world is the most   part in the world. If you want to talk about denialism, the failure of many people  —   including, I’m afraid, many of those in my profession  —   to point out the ubiquity of   in Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, you name it, both   and private, is a real form of denialism.  You’ve had a history of relentless    —   which I call a disease because the peoples it has hurt the most aren’t the victims of   but the perpetrators of  .    The Arab world expelled about 900, 000 Jews after 1948. I would argue the countries that suffered the most from that expulsion were Egypt, Algeria, Libya, and so on  —   not only because they were deprived of a valuable human resource, but [because] they were deprived of the very idea of diversity, ethnic and religious. Jeff Stein Max Fisher, a new colleague of yours at the New York Times [and former Vox editor] wrote to you on Twitter, “I guess we’ll have to disagree as to whether it’s acceptable or correct to call an entire racial group ‘pathologically diseased. ’”   @declanwalsh @BretStephensNYT I guess we just all have to agree to disagree as to whether it is acceptable or correct to call racial groups pathologically ”diseased.” —   Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) April 16, 2017    Bret Stephens If I said “the pathologies of the German mind in the 1930s,” would that mean I meant to indict every single German? No. It just struck me as a very tendentious reading of the column. I am by not any means indicting a whole race. The word mind itself   —   do you know that you don’t have a mind? It is a figure of speech, right? So I was using it as a figure of speech  —   which, by the way, I can find Arab authors talking about “the pathologies of the Arab mind. ” The whole thing struck me as a   controversy, which in an attempt to indict me as a racist  —   which I most certainly am not  —   wound up eliding and evading the rather important subject I was trying to address, which is the extraordinarily prevalent   throughout the Arab world. That’s a pity. If I could have gone back and said some other word, maybe  —   but I don’t think, unless you are actively and willfully trying to twist what I said into something I didn’t mean, that you can read that as in any sense a racist comment or not a fair comment to appear in a major publication.    Nine out of 10 of the most   countries in the world, according to various surveys, are Arab countries. That’s a problem. How often have I read this story in major news media? Or heard, as you suggested, that it’s not   but  ? Or some other excuse for it? If you had the levels of racism present today in Maryland as you have   prevalent today in, shall we say, Jordan, you certainly as a young journalist would be mindful of it. Jeff Stein Well, to that point, you’ve also said the arguments of Black Lives Matter are part of the liberal imagination. Bret Stephens I think Black Lives Matter has some really thuggish elements in it. Look  —   at the risk of being incredibly politically incorrect, but I guess that’s my job  —   I think that all lives matter. Not least black lives. I think there is a bullying quality present in, for instance, efforts to kick speakers off of campuses at Middlebury and Claremont McKenna. I think there are instances of problematic policing. But I would agree with [Manhattan Institute scholar] Heather Mac Donald that the police are vital to the preservation of black lives, and I agree with FBI Director James Comey that there’s been something of a “Ferguson effect”  —   in which the dramatic increase in murders is connected with a culture of [resistance to police].    Jeff Stein Do you think there’s a persistent problem with systemic racial policing of black communities in American police departments?  Bret Stephens Let’s think about what we mean by “systemic. ” Do I think police chiefs, many of which are   or Hispanic, wake up and say, “Let’s systemically oppress   communities?” No, I don’t. Are there instances in which that happens? I’m sure there are.  But anecdote is not data. And that’s an issue. And you also have an issue where a lot of criminality tragically occurs in   communities. And police go to where criminality occurs.  ",-1.0

"How Jets are trying to right Geno Smith mistake with Bryce Petty. Geno Smith became the latest quarterback drafted by the Jets to get added to the team’s QB graveyard this week when a torn ACL ended his season and  . Smith is just another log on the fire that is the Jets’ terrible quarterback history since Joe Namath left town in 1976. Smith’s name will go alongside Richard Todd, Browning Nagle, Mark Sanchez and all the rest as failed quarterbacks taken in the draft. The Jets messed up with Smith from the start. They were gushing over him at the 2013 rookie minicamp the week after he was drafted in the second round and desperately wanted him to beat out Sanchez in training camp. The point became moot when Rex Ryan put Sanchez into the fourth quarter of a preseason game against the Giants and Sanchez’s shoulder got wrecked. Smith was the Day 1 starter despite being far from ready. That brings us to Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg. There is an understandable clamoring among fans to see Petty play right now. With Smith out, turning back to Ryan Fitzpatrick feels like watching a movie you did not particularly like the first time. Petty’s play in the preseason and just the allure of the unknown has fans anxious to see what the   player from Baylor can do. There seems to be more patience with Hackenberg, but we’ll see how long that lasts. The Petty fan club should slow down. Maybe the Jets are finally getting this right  instead of throwing him into the fire too soon. Both Smith and Sanchez were Day 1 starters with the Jets and both had massive struggles. The Jets have not exhibited patience with a quarterback since Chad Pennington. Petty was allowed to sit and watch last season in a “redshirt” year. This summer, he had some good moments in the preseason, but he was far from perfect. The Jets would have loved for Petty to have beaten out Smith for the No. 2 job. They gave Petty extended looks, hoping he would do that. But even before he suffered a shoulder injury in the final preseason game with the Eagles, the Jets brass was not convinced he was ready to be the No. 2. After the injury, he missed practice for six weeks, returning just two weeks ago. It is going to take several weeks for him to regain his timing and feel comfortable again against a defense. The Jets are doing the right thing by waiting. If the season goes further south with Fitzpatrick at the helm, Petty can play in December. To me, the earliest Petty plays, barring an injury to Fitzpatrick, is Dec. 5 against the Colts. One of the biggest debates in the NFL is whether to play a quarterback right away or have him sit and watch. Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz are the latest examples for those who want guys to play right away, but both are playing in systems that are similar to what they played in college. The Jets don’t want Hackenberg to play this season, wanting to bring him along slowly. You can argue a   pick should not be a project, but that is a discussion for another day. In many ways, the Jets are handling Petty how they should have handled Smith. Like Petty, Smith came from a gimmicky offense in college that did not translate to the NFL. Teammates were amazed by how much he struggled just getting the plays out in the huddle during that first year. Smith had some good moments that rookie season, but you wonder if his career would have gone differently if he were permitted to learn without the pressure of playing. Instead, he is the latest Jets quarterback to be cast aside. The Jets have drafted eight quarterbacks since 2006, more than any other team in the NFL, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Six of them have not panned out. Petty and Hackenberg will get the next chances at ending the   search for a franchise quarterback. Right now, those chances need to wait. The Jets have to beat the Browns, right? They couldn’t lose to an   Cleveland team that looks destined for no better than a   season, right? Well, a look back at Jets history shows there is reason to think this is no sure thing. Four times the Jets have been a team’s only win. The 1968 Bills, 1972 Oilers, 1980 Saints and 1991 Colts all won one game  —   against the Jets. That history likely means nothing, but it is a dubious distinction for Gang Green. The first instance is the most famous. The 1968 Jets were   when they went to War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo. Joe Namath threw five interceptions, three that the Bills returned for touchdowns, and the Jets lost  . The Jets would lose only twice more that season on their way to their only Super Bowl title. The Bills finished    including a loss in the rematch with the Jets that year. The 1972 Jets were nowhere near as good as the ’68 team, but they again were   when a trip to the Astrodome went bad. They took a   lead on a Bobby Howfield field goal, but four turnovers led to a   loss. The Oilers finished  . Eight years later, Archie Manning led an   Saints team into Shea Stadium, where it knocked off a terrible Jets team   thanks to three turnovers, two of those Richard Todd interceptions. The last time it happened was in 1991, Bruce Coslet’s second season as Jets coach. The Jets would finish   and go to the playoffs, but Jeff George and the dismal Colts won   at Giants Stadium. Maybe all of this means nothing when it comes to Sunday. The Browns could be starting rookie Kevin Hogan at quarterback. Their defense is abysmal, and the Jets looked like they figured a few things out last week. Or it could be another chapter in one of the sorriest sections in Jets history.",1.0

"Donald Trump and the expanding power of the presidency.  Donald Trump has promised not only to be the voice of the American people but also to take decisive, immediate action. As president, he has said he would move fast to destroy the Islamic State, scrap bad trade deals, build that wall, “stop the gangs and the violence,” and “stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. ” He would “immediately suspend immigration” from countries where terrorism is rampant. He might even defy treaty obligations and decline to aid NATO allies. The Republican nominee has led some to conclude that he intends a sweeping expansion of presidential authority. His rhetoric implies a muscular, almost unitary, presidency that would be at least as expansive as what historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. famously dubbed the “imperial presidency”  —   his critique of Richard Nixon’s abuse of power in the era of Watergate and Vietnam. But scholars of the presidency say that Barack Obama, George W. Bush and their predecessors have added so many powers to the White House toolbox that a President Trump could fulfill many of his promises legally  —    and virtually unchecked by a  Congress that has proven incapable of mustering much pushback  for decades  .    “Every president expands the power of the presidency,” said Neal Devins, a law professor at the College of William & Mary. “This is a constant pattern. They never shrink the presidency. A President Trump could say, ‘I’m going to use the Obama playbook’ and go pretty far. The difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is not going to be one of lawlessness but of the policies they pursue. ” Plenty of politicians have pledged wholesale,   shifts in policy, but Trump’s hot rhetoric stands out because his promises are rarely accompanied by details on how he might implement his initiatives. He doesn’t say how he might punish companies that ship jobs overseas, or how he would get Mexico to pay for a border wall, or how he would impose a ban on Muslims entering the country. He says he will make it happen  —   “believe me. ”             Caption   The Republican presidential candidate is out on the trail ahead of the general election in November.

"The myth of Teflon Trump.  Hillary Clinton’s political operation is clearly somewhat undecided about what line of attack to take against Donald Trump, and no Democratic Party presidential campaign would be complete without a small army of backseat drivers ready to second guess the candidate. So I don’t doubt that the substance of what Amy Chozick, Alexander Burns, and Jonathan Martin report in their article ”Hillary Clinton Struggles to Find Footing in Unusual Race” is true.    But a key piece of their framing buys into one of the oddest myths of the 2016 campaign  —   the entirely false legend of ”Teflon Trump,” who shrugs off problems that would sink a conventional candidate. They write that ”key Democrats say they are growing worried that her campaign has not determined how to combat her unpredictable, often wily Republican rival, to whom criticism seldom sticks and rules of decorum seem not to apply.” Criticism really has stuck to Donald Trump The reality is that Donald Trump is currently viewed unfavorably by 58 percent of the population, with fewer than 40 percent saying they have a positive impression of him. That is the conventional rules of politics at work. Trump gets criticized, and much of the criticism sticks  —   driving the public to a deeply negative view of him.    You see the same thing at the elite level. Most elected Republicans are supporting the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. But some are not, including Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, a number of other elected officials are taking the odd position that they support Trump but aren’t endorsing him.    This stuff all takes perhaps less of a toll on Trump than one might like. But the toll is very real. The result of   media coverage of Trump is that he is very   and very unpopular. The criticism sticks. Hillary Clinton is winning the election What’s bothering Democrats is that they think Trump should be losing in a landslide, which does not currently seem to be the case.    That said, at the moment the HuffPost Pollster polling average has Trump losing by a   margin, which, though not enormous, would equal Barack Obama’s win over Mitt Romney in 2012. What’s more, Clinton is currently going through a uniquely unfavorable stretch of the calendar while Trump has secured the GOP nomination and is enjoying a wave of new endorsements from former opponents  —   and all the while she is fending off the last throes of Bernie Sanders’s insurgency. There’s no guarantee of what is going to happen in November, but if the election were held tomorrow, she would win. And her lead is more likely to grow than to shrink over the course of June as she wins endorsements from Sanders, Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Cenk Uygur, and Robert Reich and adds voters on the left.    Parties have historically struggled to capture a third straight term in the White House, and 2016 does not have the makings of an economic boom year. Nonetheless, Clinton seems more likely than not to win  —   which is more or less what you want from a candidate. Clinton’s problems have nothing to do with Trump If Democrats want an explanation for why the election isn’t a blowout, the thing they should be remarking on is not Trump’s fake immunity to criticism  —   it’s the unpopularity of their own nominee. Clinton’s unfavorable rating is higher than that of any other major party presidential nominee in history, with the sole exception of Trump. Fortunately for her, the   gap is actually rather large. And in her defense, there appears to be a structural rise in nominee unpopularity linked to growing political polarization. Still, the fact remains that Democratic Party elites deliberately cleared the field in favor of a    nominee whose limitations as a stump speaker and poor relationship with the press were   and widely understood at the time. The thinking was that a divisive primary would have hurt the party, but they ended up getting a divisive primary anyway. Clinton can reasonably hope that when the primary ends, her numbers will improve, though it’s far from guaranteed that this is the case. The point, however, is that whatever challenges Clinton is facing in the general election, they have nothing to do with difficulty attacking Trump. He has been criticized from an unusually wide range of figures, and those criticisms have stuck. He is unpopular, and he is currently losing the election.  Watch: Men shouldn’t fear women. Trump should.    ",-1.0
"Late sleepers are tired of being discriminated against. And science has their back..  We live in a world that worships the early riser. Think of everything we’re told on the virtues of waking up early.     ”The early bird catches the worm.” ”   early to rise, makes a man. .. ” (Ben Franklin’s most famous saying) ”Nice of you to join us today” (snarky dictum of teachers and bosses everywhere)  The message is clear: Starting early is the way to get ahead; lateness is ugly as sin. A couple of weeks ago, I reported on the science of chronobiology, which finds we all have an internal clock that keeps us on a consistent sleep and wake cycle. But the key finding is that everyone’s clock is not the same. Most people fall in the middle, preferring to sleep around 11 pm to 7 am. But many  —   perhaps 40 percent of the population  —   don’t naturally fit in this schedule.      Related Chronotypes, explained: Why being out of sync with society is bad for health    There are night owls among us  —   whose whole circadian schedules are shifted later  —   and morning larks, who are shifted earlier. (If you’re curious, you can assess your chronotype with this quiz here.) These traits are determined by genetics and are extremely hard to change. What’s more, the research is finding that if we fight our chronotypes, our health may suffer.    But most striking to me wasn’t the health implications of messing with your clock. It was the stigma late sleepers feel in a society ruled by early risers. Simply put: These late sleepers are tired of being judged for a behavior they cannot easily control. If they can’t change their sleep patterns, maybe society should become more accepting of them. Late sleepers are made to feel like losers I spoke to several people with delayed sleep phase, a condition that puts people on the extreme end of the   chronotype. These people have a hard time falling asleep before 2 or 3 am, and prefer to sleep until around noon. There’s nothing wrong with their sleep other than that their schedules for it are shifted.    We tend to assume that late wakers are the partiers, the deadbeats, the ones who are so irresponsible they can’t keep a basic schedule. The people I spoke to found these assumptions to be personally damaging. ”I felt like such a loser because I wasn’t able to do it [wake up early],” Kat Park, a    health care administrator who lives in Overland Park, Kansas, told me. Growing up in a strict, traditional Korean household, Park says she had a hard time living up to her parents’ expectations. ”They just thought I was a lazy ” she says. During college, she   with a mix of stimulants in the morning and alcohol at night  —   not to party but just to function on society’s schedule. ”The stimulants would make me edgy and then they wouldn’t wear off at night,” she says. ”It was bad.” At one point, she was fired from a job for sleeping in too often.    Night owl Cassidy Solokis, a    junior at Northern Arizona University, says she’s also suffered a lot: ”People have mocked me for it, saying how lazy I am, that I’m not trying hard enough, and that really bothers me, because it’s not my fault. I’m really, really trying, and it’s just not working.” Solokis says that even the first doctor she saw about the condition didn’t believe her. ”He told me to stop drinking coffee and I’d be fine,” she says. ”And when it didn’t work, he assumed I was lying.” So she sought the care of another specialist. If doctors don’t believe in the condition, peers are even less likely to empathize. ”It’s really frustrating; when you try to explain it to another person, they don’t get it,” she says. Andreas, a delayed sleeper who I chatted with over email, also worries that the condition is very difficult to explain: ”My first reaction when I heard about the condition was, ’Oh, no, this is one of those conditions that no one will take seriously. I better keep it to myself. ’” The late sleepers I spoke to also lamented how struggling to fit in hurt their performance in daily life. ”There’s a lot of emotional baggage tied up into going to work,” Amy, a    Seattle resident with delayed sleep phase, told me. ”You’re arriving later, you feel like you’re not actually present, when people ask you questions you give stupid answers.”       Should late sleepers change their habits, or should society become more accepting of them? Delayed sleep phase is extreme. Less than 1 percent of the population has it. But in talking with people who have the disorder, I wondered if their experiences are mirrored in people with less extreme chronotypes. What happens if you naturally like to sleep until 9 am but are forced to go in for an 8 am meeting? Or what happens to teens  —   who have delayed sleep phase in much higher numbers  —   who need to wake up for early morning classes? Camilla Kring is the founder of the   an international advocacy group calling for increased acceptance of the  . ”I actually think we have a lot of discrimination in our society against late chronotypes,” she told me. Meetings at the beginning of workdays favor early risers (whose mental sharpness peaks earlier as well). In a world where an internet connection makes working whenever, wherever possible, she argues, companies ought to allow workers to set more flexible schedules around their ideal sleep time. According to Kring, small changes could make a huge impact. ”Just by changing your schedule by an hour or two, it can result in having more sleep, higher productivity,” she says. In this view, workplaces ought to be more accommodating of chronotypes. The research generally backs this idea up. ”Although we should avoid a simplistic shortcut of associating ET [evening types] to some negative aspects, the data point to the idea that an [evening type] pattern is a risk factor for some disorders, whereas [morning type] is a protection factor,” a 2012 review of hundreds of papers in the academic literature concludes. But it also just makes common sense: We should be working when we feel most alert and productive. Whether disparities can be fixed by altering schedules to better suit chronotypes hasn’t undergone rigorous  scientific testing. To me, it seems harmless enough to try.     ",-1.0
"Everyone seems to hate online reader comments. Here’s why I treasure them..  When NPR announced last month that it would no longer feature comments from readers on its website, general rejoicing followed.  “Good riddance  —   and everybody else should do the same” was the tone of the response I saw on Twitter. USA Today columnist Rem Rieder, noting that other news organizations are moving away from comments as well, wrote, “Their disappearance is welcome. ” And even NPR’s ombudswoman, Elizabeth Jensen, wrote that the move made sense to her, since such a small slice of the audience was participating. I disagree. I find value in reader comments that can’t be adequately reproduced elsewhere. The argument that the conversation has migrated to Facebook and Twitter is flawed. Those are good places for discussion, but they are no substitute for having discussion take place where the story itself lives. I’m convinced that many smart readers with something to contribute will not follow a story onto social media to talk about it. News organizations should fix online comments rather than ditch them. They need fixing, for sure. Too often, they are a place where trolls congregate, ready to offer their   opinions. Too often, comments are racist, misogynistic, abusive and even libelous. They can also hurt newsgathering, sometimes criticizing reporters’ sources and making them more reluctant to talk to reporters next time. In 2010, when I was the editor of the Buffalo News, managing editor Brian Connolly and I were disturbed enough by the   destructive comments to try an experiment. It was weird enough to get us some national attention, though that wasn’t our goal: We took away the anonymity of reader comments, requiring readers to use their names and tell us their locations, in much the same way as traditional letters to the editor. It was inconvenient and   for us, and it reduced the number of comments substantially  —   but it made a world of difference in terms of civility. It’s amazing what happens when you have to put your name behind what you say. (The paper no longer does it that way, Connolly tells me, but has since experimented with a few different methods for readers to sign in.) At the New York Times, where I was public editor until last spring, I found the reader comments an irreplaceable guide to my constituency. Of course, I also got response on Twitter and Facebook, and in an endless flow of emails, but commenters provided some of the most thoughtful feedback and discussion. When the commentariat occasionally blasted me, I took it seriously and made course adjustments. And the appreciation expressed there softened that tough job. (The Times employs a dozen or so moderators who approve most comments before they are posted; that’s expensive and, for most news organizations, unrealistic.) Here at The Post, I read comments on my columns and on many articles with interest. They can be pretty snarky as well as  . When I wrote recently about how Donald Trump might be considering a new TV venture as a fallback should his presidential bid fail, there was, for example, this comment from one Humahumahummus1: “Oh honey, that was the end game all along. You need to be quicker than that. The rest of us could see it coming a mile away. ” I’ve also been called every nickname for Margaret  —   and I’ve been called a few other choice names, too. But I find the feedback worth having. It’s far different  —   certainly more varied  —   than response on Twitter, where many journalists congregate to talk shop, or on Facebook, which can become an echo chamber of   friends reinforcing one another’s beliefs. “These platforms are clearly providing us greater access to new audiences, but they’ve also made it easier than ever to insulate ourselves from ideas that differ from our own,” said Amanda Zamora, chief audience officer for the Texas Tribune, who spoke last week at a Poynter Institute confab on 10 years of participatory journalism. She took it further: “By abandoning comments, news organizations are not only giving up an important role in shaping public discourse  —   they are giving up a key avenue toward having direct, sustainable relationships with their audiences. ” An organization called the Coral Project is working on it. Funded by the Knight Foundation and involving The Post, the Times and the tech developer Mozilla Foundation, it’s an effort to find the best ways for news organizations to engage with their audiences  —   on their own sites. That includes a renewed commitment to reader comments, done right. Through   tools, it hopes to give even the smallest newsrooms a way to filter and manage response from readers. For example, a tool called Trust, through elegant and precise filtering, would “highlight the good as much as punish the bad,” allowing the best commenters to be identified and fostered, the project’s director, Andrew Losowsky, told Columbia Journalism Review. It’s tempting to say that comments are more trouble than they’re worth. But at a time when many news organizations are struggling to survive, improving comments is worthwhile work. They can help build community, right on our own sites, and finally get past the idea of readers as passive audiences who have to take what we dish out.  For more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.

"Could you trade in your political beliefs for their exact opposite? These six people did..      EXIT RIGHT: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century By Daniel Oppenheimer Simon & Schuster. 403 pp. $28. Daniel Oppenheimer’s “Exit Right” is a flawed book, but it is flawed in the particular way that only great books can be. It fails to fully answer the impossibly ambitious questions it lays out, but its insights are so absorbing that it doesn’t matter. Its stories only partially fit Oppenheimer’s underlying argument, but the prose is so perfect you barely realize it. And just when you think you understand what propels and paralyzes one of his characters, the author moves to another. This book proves so satisfying precisely because it leaves you wanting much more. “Why is it that each of us holds the beliefs that we do?” Oppenheimer asks, posing his central question in his opening paragraph. “Why do we follow this set of politics, vote for this party, and associate with these people?” For answers, he excavates the lives and writings of six   intellectuals, politicians and journalists  —   Whittaker Chambers, James Burnham, Ronald Reagan, Norman Podhoretz, David Horowitz and Christopher Hitchens  —   who experienced political or ideological conversions, starting left, veering right.    Simon & Schuster  Together, they are a history of the American left during the American century, how it responded to the Great Depression and deep depressions, to world wars and Iraq wars, and some readers may experience the book through that lens. Please don’t be one of them. The individuals are the real story here. Drawing from memoirs, biographies, essays, interviews, and an exhaustive reading of   literature and news accounts, Oppenheimer fashions a chapter for each, showing in every instance that “political identity is always a negotiation, between what it demands and who we are. ” He starts with Chambers, whose childhood alienation and fantasies of saving the world led him from the   literary ferment of 1920s Columbia University to the Communist Party, to writing for the Daily Worker and New Masses, to going underground and committing espionage for the Soviet Union. What would pry this dedicated man away from his cause, to the point that Chambers would later testify against his close friend, the spy Alger Hiss? “To leave the party wouldn’t simply entail a change of political ideas and loyalties; it would render meaningless all the sacrifices he’s made in communism’s name,” Oppenheimer writes. “And it would, if he proved unable to replace communism with a new and equally substantial belief system, leave him bereft of purpose in the world. ” [Book review: How to Catch a Russian Spy: The True Story of an American Civilian Turned Double Agent” by Naveed Jamali] Chambers’s transformation features many of the forces that turn the book’s other protagonists: shifting realities, new books, mystical moments. Chambers grew disappointed in the party and its imperial  ; Stalin’s Great Purge horrified him. He embraced books such as Vladi mir Tchernavin’s “I Speak for the Silent,” which unmasked Soviet corruption and ma nipu la tion. And he discovered prayer, later even recalling a mysterious voice urging him to fight for freedom. “Chambers still felt the calling to fight for the redemption of humanity,” Oppenheimer explains. But the means had changed. “Unable to live without high purpose, addicted to politics, he would fight communism with all his heart and soul. ” “Exit Right” dwells on these moments of metamorphosis. “It’s during the period of political transition, when the bones of one’s belief system are broken and poking out through the skin, that the contingency and complexity of belief become most visible,” Oppenheimer writes. And belief is what he hopes to understand. Not all the case studies in “Exit Right” are as compelling as Chambers’s; Oppenheimer certainly leads with his best punch. By contrast, Burnham, the brilliant critic and Marxist philosopher, is dazzling as a thinker but flat as a person  —   better to read him, I suspect, than read about him  —   while Podhoretz offers the saddest, smallest tale of all, that of a writer obsessed with his value in “the stock market report on reputations” of New York intellectual life. For Burnham, a   with Leon Trotsky (their letters to one another are remarkable in their mix of erudition and pettiness) and a realization that the New Deal might really be as far left as America needed to go would nudge him away from the left and the American Workers Party. As one comrade put it, for Burnham the work of the party was “not a vocation but an avocation. ” Podhoretz, a gifted magazine editor at the journal Commentary, was devastated after his grating 1967 memoir, “Making It,” received brutal reviews, including by friends on the left such as Norman Mailer. He had yearned for the recognition that comes with writing something transcendent. Instead, he realized that “he wasn’t great,” Oppenheimer writes. “He wasn’t even good. . . . And he was wrecked by it. ” In that wreckage, Podhoretz remade his politics, leaving secular   for a conservatism steeped in tradition, religion, duty, Israel and America. He also reinterpreted his memoir as a political battle rather than a literary project  —   and in that battle, those traitors on the left were the enemy. “It was as though he’d been replaced by a version of himself from an adjacent timeline,” Oppenheimer writes. [How the American left fell in and out of love with Fidel Castro] It’s comforting to believe that our political convictions emanate from a deep consideration of principles and paradigms, a careful weighing of alternative belief systems, rather than, say, stubborn opposition to our parents, passive acceptance of regional customs or getting mugged. But as Oppenheimer warns, “the grounds of our beliefs are more contingent than we could possibly ever account for. ” For   writers such as Horowitz and Hitchens, the impulses to move right sprang from contingencies far more tragic than negative book reviews  —   the murder of a former colleague for one, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, for the other. Horowitz’s identity was wrapped in the American left: from meeting the Communist Party friends of his parents, to Berkeley and Europe, to the   magazine Ramparts, to his friendship with the Black Panther leader Huey Newton. But it was the murder of his former colleague Betty Van Patter in the 1970s (at the hands of the Panthers, he soon suspected) that led him to question everything about the left and himself. This process unfolded through a series of essays, notably “Left Illusions” in the Nation in 1979 and “Requiem for a Radical” in New West magazine in 1981, as well as Horowitz’s own epiphany moment  —   almost all these guys point to one  —  in a Berkeley bookstore, where he realized that his writings on Marxism were lost in the multiplicity of ideas and could easily prove inconsequential or simply false. Suddenly he’s voting for Reagan. With Hitchens, “a perpetually disappointed idealist,” Oppenheimer plays shrink to explain how, after   the   socialist and prolific correspondent became the scourge of the American left and a relentless supporter of the war in Iraq. Ever mocking of lefties turned rightward, Hitchens became one himself, regarding the war as “a chance to see force deployed on the side of the downtrodden after so many years of writing furiously about force being applied against them. ” It was also, Oppenheimer argues, a chance for this son of a British naval officer to see the new and old colonial empires atone. “Hitchens, born to Britain and adopted by America, felt doubly responsible, and saw in Iraq the opportunity to redeem both of his nations and their sins. ” I’m a sucker for   intellectual histories, such as Robert Heilbroner’s bracing “The Worldly Philosophers,” on the world’s great economists, or Paul Elie’s “The Life You Save May Be Your Own,” about four American Catholic writers of the 20th century. (Louis Menand’s “The Metaphysical Club” peers from my bookshelf, still unread, quietly judging me.) So I’m entirely predisposed to love “Exit Right,” and I do. I wish, however, that Oppenheimer had better fleshed out links among his subjects. The tangencies barely graze, or Oppenheimer chooses to share little of them. He recalls Reagan’s obsession with Chambers’s autobiography, “Witness,” details how Hitchens eviscerated Podhoretz as an intellectual “ ” and reminds us that a lot of these guys’ lives revolved around the “intellectual eroticism” pulsating at Columbia University. (Aspiring thought leaders, take heed: If you wish to become a fashionable intellectual who suffers a midlife crisis of conviction, attend Columbia.) [Review of “Political Animals: How Our   Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics” by Rick Shenkman] And while the exit from   politics is clear, the embrace of the right is less so. Horowitz’s transformation is straightforward; so is Hitchens’s, if you accept Oppenheimer’s psychoanalysis. But why do Chambers, Burnham or Podhoretz necessarily embrace conservatism after leaving the left? What was in the water? This brings us back to Reagan, whose presence in this volume initially perplexes. The mainstream liberalism of his younger days was a modest inheritance from his father, one he quickly spent. “Not for Reagan a descent into utopian delusion, followed by a long dark night of the soul, culminating in a baptismal emergence into the light of God, truth, and conservatism,” Oppenheimer admits. “In Reagan’s conversion story there was no conversion at all. ” An outlier in this tale, Reagan gradually takes up conservatism and remakes his belief system, informed by Hollywood labor disputes and   promotional work for General Electric during the 1950s and 1960s. In Oppenheimer’s telling, Reagan’s path, easier and less   is mirrored by the country he would lead. “For Reagan, and for tens of millions of Americans who would travel with him to the Right, political transformation wasn’t marked by catharsis and epiphany,” he writes. “It rarely even revealed itself as a transformation. It was life, lived year to year, decade to decade,” with a deceptive sense of permanence “that gave more comfort and was less anxious to bear than a story of discontinuity and change would have been. ” After all, few of us have the luxury of working out our political and ideological angst in the pages of glossy magazines and learned journals. But those are the pages on which Oppenheimer lingers, and his reading is perceptive. “There’s a certain kind of political writing and thinking that can be done only by someone who is in tension,” Oppenheimer concludes in a brilliant and almost unpardonably late postscript. “It’s by putting ourselves  —   our highest ideals, our most atavistic impulses, our deepest loyalties  —   in conversation with the world, with vulnerability and conviction, that new possibilities open up. That’s how we discover ourselves as intellectuals and artists. It’s also how social movements are born, how societies evolve, how culture is enriched and our collective imagination is expanded. ” Oppenheimer began with a book about the origins of political beliefs and ended with one about the literary force of political misgivings.

"U.S. Navy sends strike group toward Korean peninsula.   SEOUL  —   A U. S. Navy strike group led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier was making its way toward the Korean Peninsula on Sunday “to maintain readiness” as Kim Jong Un’s regime in North Korea prepared to mark key anniversaries in the coming weeks. North Korea is expected to hold a huge military parade Saturday to celebrate the 105th birthday of its founding president, Kim Il Sung, and to mark with similar fanfare the 85th anniversary of the creation of the Korean People’s Army on April 25.  Analysts expect the recent barrage of missile launches  to continue, and activities around the country’s known nuclear test site have raised concerns that Pyongyang may be preparing for a sixth nuclear test. Over the weekend, North Korea said that it was not afraid of military strikes like those the United States launched on Syria last week, saying it could defend itself with its “tremendous military muscle with a nuclear force. ”  In this atmosphere, the Carl Vinson strike group, which includes a carrier air wing and two   destroyers, was ordered to travel to the “Western Pacific. ” When the group left Singapore on Saturday, it was bound for Australia before receiving the new orders.  [ Will North Korea fire a missile capable of hitting the U. S. mainland? Probably.  ]  “The U. S. Pacific Command ordered the Carl Vinson Strike Group north as a prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence in the Western Pacific,” said Dave Benham, a spokesman for the Pacific Command.  “The number one threat in the region continues to North Korea, due to its reckless, irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability,” he said, according to the Agence   news agency.   The Vinson group participated in joint drills with the South Korean military last month to prepare for a sudden change on the peninsula  —   including the collapse of the North Korean regime or an invasion.  North Korea has been testing   missiles over recent months, and Kim said in January that North Korea had “entered the final stage of preparation for a   of an intercontinental ballistic missile” capable of hitting the mainland United States. In response, President Trump tweeted: “It won’t happen!”  In a   phone call Saturday, Trump told South Korea’s acting president, Hwang   that he had “  discussions about North Korea’s serious nuclear problems and how to respond to them” during his summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, according to the South Korean leader’s office.   [  As North Korea’s arsenal grows, experts see heightened risk of ‘miscalculation’  ]       (Reuters)   Trump’s vow to act alone if China does not rein in North Korea combined with the U. S. president’s sudden decision to launch airstrikes on Syria have some analysts speculating that North Korea could be next. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a visit to Seoul last month that “all options are on the table,” including military options. U. S. administrations have long ruled out even pinprick strikes on North Korean nuclear sites or missile targets because of the potential for catastrophic damage in South Korea. The North has conventional artillery massed on its side of the demilitarized zone that bisects the Korean Peninsula, giving it the capacity to inflict serious damage on Greater Seoul, a metropolitan area of 20 million people just 30 miles south of the DMZ.  A statement from North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, published Sunday, said that the attack on Syria was “absolutely unpardonable as it was an undisguised act of aggression against a sovereign state. ” North Korea will not be “frightened” by the U. S. strike on Syria, according to a statement published by the   Korean Central News Agency. The strikes showed why North Korea needed nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, the statement said. “We will bolster up in every way our capability for   to cope with the U. S. evermore reckless moves for a war and defend ourselves with our own force,” it said.

"Christie’s office kept ‘naughty or nice’ list of Jersey politicians. He’s Christie Kringle  —   and every present he doles out gets jotted on a meticulous    list. Jurors in the Bridgegate trial of two top aides to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie saw firsthand Friday how, since 2011, the governor’s office kept a detailed spreadsheet recording the perks and pork he left under the trees of important state Democrats. Alongside each pol’s name and list of gifts on the spreadsheet was a    ranking of the likelihood that the pol would, in return, endorse Christie for  . Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich’s ranking of “4” was just within the naughty range. But when Sokolich withheld his endorsement  —   despite getting what the spreadsheet lists as a “personal WTC tour,” a “breakfast mtg with Governor” and other gifts  —   Christie’s closest elves blocked the town’s access to the George Washington Bridge, federal prosecutors argue. During questioning Friday, Assistant US Attorney Lee Cortes asked star witness David Wildstein what determined who received tours of Ground Zero or other perks “Was the potential for endorsement a factor?” Cortes asked. “Yes, it was,” answered Wildstein, who was Christie’s  “The goal,” Wildstein said, “was to secure endorsements of Gov. Chris Christie from individuals or organizations that would not typically support a Republican governor. ” The prosecutors are trying to show jurors the      mindset that gripped Christie’s closest advisers as the governor was attempting to portray himself as a White   leader beloved on both sides of the aisle. It’s that mindset, they argue, that would lead the trial’s two conspiracy defendants  —   Bill Baroni, the PA’s former deputy director, and Bridget Anne Kelly, the head of Christie’s Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs  —   to collude with Wildstein in the retaliatory,     lane closings. Defense lawyers counter that Baroni and Kelly were simply Wildstein’s pawns and that Wildstein was controlled by Christie. Wildstein is expected to testify as early as Monday that he and Baroni “bragged” to Christie about the lane closing on its third day, at the   anniversary memorial in 2013, refuting the governor’s claims of knowing nothing about it. In an bizarre coincidence, a   crash caused another massive traffic jam on the bridge just as Wildstein took the stand in the trial in Newark federal court. Meanwhile, NBC4 reported Friday that key members of the New Jersey Assembly were   given the trial accusations that the governor lied about knowing about the lane closures. Brian Murray, Christie’s press secretary, told The Post in an   that the report was “ridiculous. ”",1.0

"Oklahoma lawmaker: pregnant women’s bodies aren’t their own, because they are “hosts”.  An Oklahoma state legislator, Rep. Justin Humphrey, is pushing a bill that would require a woman to get written permission from her sexual partner if she wants to have an abortion. The Supreme Court already struck down a very similar bill two decades ago, which means Humphrey’s bill would have almost no chance of holding up in court if it ever became law.      So why is Humphrey trying to pass it anyway? He explained his reasoning rather bluntly to Jordan Smith of the Intercept: Once a woman decides to be “irresponsible” by having sex, he said, her body is no longer entirely her own  —   because she will always be a potential “host” to a pregnancy:  Ultimately, [Humphrey] said, his intent was to let men have a say. “I believe one of the breakdowns in our society is that we have excluded the man out of all of these types of decisions,” he said. “I understand that they feel like that is their body,” he said of women. “I feel like it is a separate  —   what I call them is, is you’re a ‘host.’ And you know when you enter into a relationship you’re going to be that host and so, you know, if you   that then take all precautions and don’t get pregnant,” he explained. “So that’s where I’m at. I’m like, hey, your body is your body and be responsible with it. But after you’re irresponsible then don’t claim, well, I can just go and do this with another body, when you’re the host and you invited that in. ”  Humphrey told Smith that his original intent was to force fathers to pay child support from the moment of conception. That specific language was excised from the bill, he said.     But what remained was the disturbing extension of that logic: If a man and a woman have equal rights and responsibilities over the contents of the woman’s womb, then her womb  —   her body  —   is quite literally no longer her own.    When reproductive rights advocates talk about “bodily autonomy,” this is what they mean. The central question is: Does a woman have full rights to determine what happens to her body while she is pregnant, or only partial rights? If she is pregnant and does not want to be, can someone else  —   whether it’s the government or her sexual partner  —   force her to continue using her body to incubate a fetus, and then force her to use her body to birth it?  For many Americans, the question of when life begins and the morality of abortion is deeply complicated. But legally, the question is simple: Once a woman becomes pregnant, must she always be compelled to take on the extra medical risk of carrying that pregnancy to term?     For Humphrey, the answer is a clear “yes. ” But the modern   movement, which tends to insist on compassion for pregnant women, rarely puts it in such stark terms. Passing likely unconstitutional abortion bans is par for the course in Oklahoma, and many other states            Last year, Oklahoma’s legislature passed a bill that would have made performing abortion a felony for doctors. Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed it  —   not because she disagreed with its premise, but because she thought it would likely be found unconstitutional and waste the state’s time and money in court. However, that logic didn’t stop Fallin from signing a total ban on the safest, most common method of   abortion. That ban was, predictably, blocked in court for violating Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s 1973 decision that legalized abortion until a fetus is viable.     Humphrey’s bill is one of two   bills the Oklahoma legislature is considering that will probably be found unconstitutional in court, Smith explains. The other bill prohibits “discrimination” against fetuses with abnormalities, a measure that has already been blocked in other states like Indiana.   Oklahoma lawmakers are clearly willing to pass extreme   laws despite Roe. But Oklahoma is hardly unique in this regard. It’s very common for   state legislatures to pass extreme abortion bans. Sometimes it’s a statement of principle; sometimes it’s a hope that the bill might force a court challenge that will later overturn Roe. But in the end, it’s almost always expensive and futile.

For those who have no idea what we're talking about, strap in: Here's what you missed in the last seven days on this world wide web of ours. https://twitter.com/paul\_lander/status/735968550607716352 https://twitter.com/SugarGretel/status/735968986400194560 https://twitter.com/sunkisseeddd/status/735969071896748032 https://twitter.com/elielandau/status/735969109800824832 https://twitter.com/JasonSpellman/status/735969252998422528 https://twitter.com/daniusrap/status/735969372473331718 https://twitter.com/DanielAshley13/status/735969374113267712 https://twitter.com/Benjamin\_G\_Lund/status/735969467767754752 https://twitter.com/RimmyBuffett/status/735969593596993536 https://twitter.com/roeu812/status/735969762442895360 https://twitter.com/paul\_lander/status/735970608081555456 https://twitter.com/Sillifunnihappi/status/735972604171849728 https://twitter.com/Dreamweasel/status/735976567642456064 https://twitter.com/Roybq/status/735976733963227136 https://twitter.com/jjbhashtag/status/735977023483596800 https://twitter.com/Dreamweasel/status/735977879297765377 https://twitter.com/Dreamweasel/status/735978089759559681 https://twitter.com/cubs2win47/status/735978121850060802 https://twitter.com/oh2tweet/status/735981563028987904 https://twitter.com/KaivanShroff/status/735986217557327872 https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior/status/735989262441537537 https://twitter.com/GrnEyedMandy/status/735989576204947456 https://twitter.com/Inti003/status/735978542836518912 https://twitter.com/seokmvn/status/734952209486647298 https://twitter.com/jedisoldier/status/734955514078105600 https://twitter.com/buckchalla/status/734958905390817280 https://twitter.com/fathercevans/status/734959649108070402 https://twitter.com/sebskywaIker/status/734960454586499072 https://twitter.com/THEWNTRSOLDlER/status/734962115929341953 https://twitter.com/vanillaiceseb/status/734969538211504128 https://twitter.com/PAULROVlAS/status/735003331945500672 https://twitter.com/dylanohollands/status/735027501974597635 https://twitter.com/aestheticasston/status/735050937048399872 https://twitter.com/thorlokid/status/735067163766194176 https://twitter.com/mishaIeckiss/status/735096439198646272 https://twitter.com/ConfusedCap/status/735096613014642690 https://twitter.com/MarkHamiIl/status/735455555658125312 https://twitter.com/civilstan/status/735456308883787776 https://twitter.com/a\_anne99/status/735464073995948033 https://twitter.com/ronangaywaren/status/735474145828429825 https://twitter.com/VinylJew/status/735559527345463296 https://twitter.com/IKNOWTHATROAD/status/735503666656907266 https://twitter.com/dastridly/status/735513660068495360 https://twitter.com/shxrlocked/status/735698147247149060 https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/735696011172012033 https://twitter.com/BRIANMBENDIS/status/735952384057212928 https://twitter.com/brubaker/status/735969722001301506 https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/735601538920534016 https://twitter.com/chrisarrant/status/735557426888347649 https://twitter.com/brentschoonover/status/735843297256562700 https://twitter.com/CaptainPlanet/status/735614090601627648 https://twitter.com/ArchieComics/status/735621772591124480 https://twitter.com/nickspencer/status/735818449755066368 https://twitter.com/nickspencer/status/735819058034003969 https://twitter.com/nickspencer/status/735819374477467651 https://twitter.com/ghostwritingcow/status/735483457292374016 https://twitter.com/kubrickphile/status/735869937328267264 https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/735901648812281856 https://twitter.com/JarrodAlonge/status/735863972386197504 https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/735872574928916480 https://twitter.com/dominicholden/status/735893688270921728 https://twitter.com/kadhimshubber/status/736094005964898305 https://twitter.com/widermargins/status/736153867545673737 https://twitter.com/AmeliaHammy/status/734048661970292736 https://twitter.com/wupton/status/734049646528450560 https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/734050220334559232 https://twitter.com/IrishBarrister/status/734049742121009152 https://twitter.com/jfeckstein/status/734916446527074305 https://twitter.com/dlandoncole/status/734064463687602176 https://twitter.com/KristinaRibali/status/734090965791559680 https://twitter.com/IanDouglas/status/734141326665633793 https://twitter.com/nordicmonte/status/734571630605697024 https://twitter.com/ryanpitts/status/734050440615059457 https://twitter.com/JamieKrock/status/734051409771909120 ",0.0
"U.S. will spend $2.6 trillion less on health care than expected before Obamacare, study projects.      A new study predicts that the federal forecast of national health care spending under President Obama’s signature health law was a big overestimate  —   by $2. 6 trillion over a   period. Expanding health insurance coverage to millions of Americans was bound to increase overall spending. After the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the actuaries for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that, as the economy recovered, the historically low growth in health spending would return to higher levels, reaching $4. 6 trillion by 2019. But in the intervening years, the annual expenditure increases have been more modest than expected, and the new estimate from the Urban Institute suggests national health spending is on to track reach $4 trillion by 2019. ”When CMS originally made those projections, they really thought the slowdown in   spending [growth] was mostly due to the recession, and afterward we’d see a return to the higher rates of spending growth  —   and that didn’t really happen,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded the new study by the Urban Institute.   [The sobering thing doctors do when they die]   Looking forward, the study’s authors also point to recent evidence that a 2014 uptick in health spending that had seemed to signal a return to higher growth may have been temporary. If slower growth persists, they argue that it will become harder to argue that it is just the economy and not the cost containment policies enabled by the Affordable Care Act that are tempering spending.     Hempstead said it’s becoming increasingly plausible that the federal policies included in the Affordable Care Act  —   and its ripple effects as programs implemented within Medicare influence the private market  —   are having a tempering effect. It’s incredibly tricky to dissociate the cause of any particular policy on the effect of   spending. In addition to the Great Recession, reimbursement cuts because of sequestration would have had an effect on spending and the Supreme Court decision to make the expansion of Medicaid optional also reduced spending compared with the original projection. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis from 2013 found that about   of the slowdown could be traced to the sluggish economy, and attributed the rest of it to various other factors. ”The hangover from the Great Recession has had significant effects on consumer spending in general, and health spending specifically,” Larry Levitt, a vice president at Kaiser, said in an email. But, he added, the Affordable Care Act ”has clearly had a large and direct effect on slowing down health spending in Medicare. Its effect on the rest of the health system is somewhat more speculative, but I believe it’s real.”   [The big way Obamacare helps the poor isn’t really about their health]   Hempstead thinks that some of the policies that came with health reform have contributed. For example, she pointed to a policy that was intended to cut hospital readmissions by introducing financial penalties for hospitals with excessive readmissions. Being readmitted to the hospital isn’t good for patients or for payers  —   a report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that 3. 3 million adult hospital readmissions racked up $41. 3 billion in hospital costs in 2011. Hospital readmission rates fell after the Affordable Care Act was implemented, both for conditions targeted by policy and those that weren’t.    NEJM  But another factor that Levitt and Hempstead pointed to was the increase in deductibles. Research has shown that patients with   health plans simply avoid the use of health care altogether while they are on the hook for their health care costs. If that’s what’s happening, it could look good for reining in spending in the short term, but may not save money in the long run  —   or be good for people’s health.    Speaking during an appearance at SXSW, President Obama discussed the many problems that occurred during the rollout of the Affordable Care Act’s website, HealthCare. gov.

"IKEA partners with NASA to make space a little more cozy. Setting up IKEA furniture may be difficult, but it’s not rocket science   …     or is it? Thanks to a new collaboration between NASA and the Swedish furniture store, the two challenges  after all. IKEA is now “looking into how a Mars habitat can become more like home,” so that one day, if we do leave this planet, we’ll be able to set up cheap,   furniture on new horizons, too. In order to determine how best to create a   home, an IKEA team is spending three days at MDRS Habitat in Utah, which the company describes as “a confined   environment that simulates the experience of outer space. ” It’s no joke  —   NASA’s own astronauts spend up to three years in this habitat in order to ready themselves for space travel. “It’s a crazy, fun experience,” IKEA creative leader Michael Nikolic said of the experience. ”We’re basically completely isolated for three days to get a taste of what astronauts go through for three years. It’s almost like that misery you feel when you’re out camping. ” But the hope is that it doesn’t always have to be so miserable. It’s unclear exactly what will come out of this collaboration, but IKEA says it’s “curious to find out how this newfound space knowledge might be relevant to the urban life in mega cities, where   living, air and water pollution is the norm. ” So it may not even be that IKEA is making furniture for us to use on Mars  —   rather, they’re attempting to use lessons gleaned from being an astronaut (or at least living like one) to improve the furniture that we have here on Earth. “I think that the essence of this collection will be about appreciating what we have on Earth: human beings, plants, clean water and air. But also diversity and a sense of belonging  —   things that we take for granted on a daily basis,” Nikolic added. “After this journey, it’ll probably feel pretty awesome to come home to my own bed. ”",1.0
"The real world of Obamacare repeal.  The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, but for governments it’s not that easy. Once something is given  —   say, health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans  —   you take it away at your peril. This is true for any government benefit, but especially for health care. There’s a reason not one Western democracy with some system of national health care has ever abolished it.  The genius of the left is to keep enlarging the entitlement state by creating new giveaways that are politically impossible to repeal. For 20 years, Republicans railed against the New Deal. Yet, when they came back into office in 1953, Eisenhower didn’t just keep Social Security, he expanded it.  People hated Obamacare for its highhandedness, incompetence and cost. At the same time, its crafters took great care to create new beneficiaries and new expectations. Which makes repeal very complicated. The Congressional Budget Office projects that, under House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare replacement bill, 24 million will lose insurance within 10 years, 14 million after the first year. Granted, the number is highly suspect. CBO projects 18 million covered by the Obamacare exchanges in 2018. But the number today is about 10 million. That means the CBO estimate of those losing coverage is already about 8 million too high. Nonetheless, there will be losers. And their stories will be plastered wall to wall across the media as sure as night follows day. That scares GOP moderates. And yet the main resistance to Ryan comes from conservative members complaining that the bill is not ideologically pure enough. They mock it as Obamacare Lite. For example, Ryan wants to ease the pain by phasing out Medicaid expansion through 2020. The conservative Republican Study Committee wants it done next year. This is crazy. For the sake of two years’ savings, why would you risk a political crash landing?  Moreover, the idea that you can eradicate Obamacare root and branch is fanciful. For all its catastrophic flaws, Obamacare changed expectations. Does any Republican propose returning to a time when you can be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition? It’s not just Donald Trump who ran on retaining this new, yes, entitlement. Everyone did. But it’s very problematic. If people know that they can sign up for insurance after they get sick, the very idea of insurance is undermined. People won’t sign up when healthy, and the insurance companies will go broke. So what do you do? Obamacare imposed a monetary fine if you didn’t sign up, for which the Ryan bill substitutes another mechanism, less   but still  . The purists who insist upon entirely escaping the heavy hand of government are dreaming. The best you can hope for is to make it less intrusive and more rational, as in the Ryan plan’s   Medicaid.  Or instituting a more realistic   system. Older patients use six times as much health care as their younger counterparts, yet Obamacare decreed, entirely arbitrarily, that the former could be charged insurance premiums no more than three times that of the latter. The GOP bill changes the ratio from    to   .  Premiums better reflecting risk constitute a major restoration of rationality. (It’s how life insurance works.) Under Obamacare, the young were unwilling to be swindled and refused to sign up. Without their support, the whole system is thus headed into a death spiral of looming insolvency.  Rationality, however, has a price. The CBO has already predicted a massive increase in premiums for   . That’s the headline. There is no free lunch. GOP   must accept that Americans have become accustomed to some new   benefits, just as moderates have to brace themselves for stories about the inevitable losers in any reform. That’s the political price for fulfilling the   promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare. Unless, of course, you go the full Machiavelli and throw it all back on the Democrats. How? Republicans could forget about meeting the arcane requirements of “reconciliation” legislation (which requires only 51 votes in the Senate) and send the Senate a replacement bill loaded up with everything conservative  —   including tort reform and insurance competition across state lines. That would require 60 Senate votes. Let the Democrats filibuster it to death  —   and take the blame when    fails and Obamacare carries on and then collapses under its own weight.

"A revolutionary school ‘turns back the clock’ in Brooklyn. St. Ann’s has “small classrooms, they were cluttered . . . the atmosphere was depressing . . . the kids looked dirty and disheveled. ” That was Uma Thurman’s   complaining in court last week that he didn’t want his    daughter attending the elite Brooklyn prep school, whose tuition starts at $39, 000 for kindergarten and goes up to $43, 000  —   not including all of the fees, donations and other expenses of private school. Well, as they say, have I got a deal for him. The BASIS Independent Brooklyn School in Red Hook is not only large and airy with modern classrooms, a   basketball court, a    art auditorium and   students. It’s only $26, 000 for each grade from  . Best of all, your child will probably learn more than at just about any school in the country. BASIS, a network of two dozen private and charter schools, was started in 1998 and will be opening a new campus in Manhattan in the fall. While America is falling behind globally  —   we were ranked 24th in the world on the most recent Program for International Student Assessment scores  —   BASIS is soaring. In math, reading and science three BASIS schools ranked above Shanghai, Korea, Finland and Singapore. If BASIS schools formed a country it would be ranked top in the world. Even compared to students whose families are in the same income brackets, BASIS is still performing 18 percent better on average. But there’s a catch. If you’re looking for a place that will coddle your kids, you’ve come to the wrong school. As headmaster Hadley Ruggles tells me, “Brooklyn is a progressive place, and it looks like we have rolled back the clock. ” The students are taught grammar. Math in the early grades involves drilling. Students are required to take three years of Latin. Writing is focused on analytical work, not “journaling. ” The school does offer some trendy classes: Elementary school requires several years of engineering and Mandarin. But they’ve also stuck with Advanced Placement classes, even as many schools have dropped them out of fear that kids will burn out from all the tests. Students as young as eighth grade are taking APs and scoring well. Plus,   take biology, chemistry and physics classes three days a week each. The teachers have come from top college and graduate programs, and many have left their own fields to teach. When Mrunali Das, who teaches calculus, applied for a job with BASIS, she taught a class at a BASIS school in Washington, DC. Because she wasn’t going to be able to learn the students’ names during one class period, she assigned them each the name of a famous mathematician. “One student really wanted to be Euclid,” she recalls, laughing. Every grade has homework  —   even kindergartners get 15 minutes per day.   can have up to two hours per night with 30 math questions four nights per week. And students are expected to do this themselves. “We don’t want too much parental intervention,” says Ruggles, who taught at the BASIS school in Scottsdale, Ariz. before coming here. “I like a   human being. ” Who doesn’t? It helps that the school doesn’t do much to emphasize extracurricular activities. Sports teams don’t practice every day and, compared to most of the expensive private schools in New York, the offerings will look paltry. There’s LEGO Robotics, but no football; drama club, but no swimming. But there’s a market for this emphasis on academics. The school already has more applications than it knows what to do with for next fall. It can only accept 100 kids per grade. And even in Brooklyn, it turns out there are families that value this kind of education. Many of them are immigrants. I met a young South Asian   who transferred in January from his public elementary school and an Eastern European   girl who left SAR Academy, an Orthodox Jewish private school in Riverdale, because she and her parents found the curriculum at BASIS to be more rigorous. Ruggles says many immigrant parents recognize that BASIS schools take the best of the pedagogy that other countries use and meld it together. It’s a school for strivers. BASIS offers a couple of scholarships to kids in Red Hook’s public housing as well as a few merit scholarships. But everyone else pays the sticker price. There’s no   financial aid. As Ruggles notes, there are families that struggle mightily to pay that tuition, but they really want their kids at BASIS. And it’s easy to see why.",1.0
"Intel Failed to Fix a Hackable Chip Flaw Despite a Year of Warnings. Over the past two years, attacks like Spectre, Meltdown, and variants on those techniques—all capable of tricking a broad range of processors into coughing up sensitive data—have shown how hard it can be to secure a chip. But it's one thing for a company like Intel to scramble to fix a vulnerability, and a very different one when it fails to act on one of those flaws for more than a year. Today researchers at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, KU Leuven in Belgium, the German Helmholtz Center for Information Security, and the Graz University of Technology in Austria revealed new versions of a hacking technique that takes advantage of a deep-seated vulnerability in Intel chips. They're spins on  something known as ZombieLoad or RIDL, an acronym for Rogue In-Flight Data Load; Intel refers to it instead as as microarchitectural data sampling, or MDS. Like the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities—which some of the same Graz researchers were involved in uncovering in early 2018—the new MDS variants represent flaws that could allow any hacker who manages to run code on a target computer to force its processor to leak sensitive data. The scenarios for that attack could include anything from a website's Javascript running in a victim's browser to a virtual machine running on a cloud server, which could then target a virtual machine on the same physical computer. But in this case, the researchers are pointing to a more serious failing on Intel's part than just another bug. While they warned Intel of these newly revealed MDS variants as early as September 2018, the chip giant has nonetheless neglected to fix the flaws in the nearly 14 months since. And while Intel announced today that it has newly patched dozens of flaws, the researchers say and the company itself admits that those fixes still don't fully protect against the MDS attacks. Intel had initially fixed some of its MDS vulnerabilities in May. But researchers at Vrije Universiteit say they warned Intel at the time that those efforts were incomplete. At Intel's request, they've kept their silence until now, for fear of enabling hackers to take advantage of the unpatched flaw before the company finally fixed it. ""The mitigation they released in May, we knew it could be bypassed. It wasn’t effective,"" says Kaveh Razavi, one of the researchers in Vrije Universiteit's VUSec group. ""They missed completely a variant of our attack—the most dangerous one."" In fact, the VUSec researchers say that in the time since they first disclosed the vulnerability to Intel, they've managed to hone it into a technique capable of stealing sensitive data in seconds rather than the hours or days they previously believed necessary. ""They missed completely a variant of our attack—the most dangerous one."" Kaveh Razavi, VUSec The MDS attacks that VUSec and TU Graz originally published in May—along with a supergroup of other researchers at University of Michigan, the University of Adelaide, KU Leuven in Belgium, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Saarland University in Germany, as well as security firms Cyberus, BitDefender, Qihoo360, and Oracle—take advantage of a strange quirk of Intel's processors to allow users who can run code on a victim processor to potentially steal sensitive data from other parts of the computer that they shouldn't have access to. Intel chips in some cases execute a command or access a part of a computer's memory ""speculatively,"" guessing at what a program will want before it even asks for it as a time-saving measure. But in some cases that speculative execution results in accessing an invalid location in memory—one that would result in the speculative process aborting. When that happens, the processor instead grabs arbitrary data from buffers, parts of the chip that serve as the ""pipes"" between different components, like the processor and its cache. The researchers showed in May that they could both manipulate those buffers to contain sensitive data like cryptographic keys or passwords, and also cause aborted speculative memory accesses. As a result, their MDS attack could leak that sensitive info from the chip's buffers to an attacker. For its fix, Intel opted against stopping its processors from grabbing arbitrary data out of buffers when invalid memory access took place. Instead, it updated the microcode in its chips to prevent the specific situations that allow that data to leak. But in doing so, the researchers say, Intel missed a few variants. One technique, called TSX asynchronous abort, or TAA, tricks a processor into using a feature called TSX that's designed to fall back to a kind of ""savepoint"" in memory if it conflicts with another process. An attacker can then trigger that conflict to force a leak of sensitive data from the chip's buffers, just in the earlier MDS attacks. That TAA variant of the MDS attack turns out to particularly serious. Intel sought to downplay the MDS flaws back in May, in part because it was then thought that a successful attack would take days to execute. But VUSec researcher Jonas Theis found a way to use TAA to trick a target machine into revealing a hash of an administrator's password in as little as 30 seconds, as shown in the video below. A hacker would still have to crack that hash to produce a usable password. But it nonetheless represents a serious oversight by Intel. ""Intel said this class of MDS attacks is very difficult to exploit,"" says VUSec's Cristiano Giuffrida. ""So we thought, OK, let’s use the most effective variant to demonstrate that you can do this efficiently."" Intel and the researchers working on its MDS vulnerabilities have butted heads from their first interactions. Intel offers a ""bug bounty"" of as much as $100,000 for hackers who report vulnerabilities in its products. When the VUSec researchers warned Intel of the MDS attacks in September 2018, Intel offered them only $40,000, and then suggested a ""gift"" of $80,000—a maneuver the researchers refused, arguing that Intel was seeking to make the bug they'd discovered look less severe. Intel eventually paid them the full $100,000 bounty. The VUSec team also warned Intel in May that its fix at the time was incomplete. Not only had Intel missed the TAA attack, but another part of the fix, which cleared buffers of sensitive data, could also be bypassed. The researchers at TU Graz say that they warned Intel about both problems ahead of the May release as well. ""They make the attack harder, but they don’t prevent it,"" says Michael Schwarz, one of the TU Graz researchers. Even now, the researchers say that they're still not entirely sure that a sweeping microcode update Intel is releasing today deals with those long-lingering issues. The VUSec team says that the company has now prevented sensitive data from some of its buffer components, but not all of them. In a statement, Intel essentially confirmed that the fix remains incomplete. ""We believe that the mitigations for TAA and MDS substantively reduce the potential attack surface,"" the chipmaker wrote in a blog post Tuesday. ""Shortly before this disclosure, however, we confirmed the possibility that some amount of data could still be inferred through a side-channel using these techniques (for TAA, only if TSX is enabled) and will be addressed in future microcode updates.

There’s one Google search trick in particular that every single   user needs to know about, and we’ll explain how it works in this post.   Google is a brilliant company that always finds smart ways to tie its various products in together. This is a great strategy for several reasons, but since Google’s core business is advertising, it can target ads much better to people who use many Google services as opposed to people who use just one or two. One great trend that has formed over the past few years is the increasing number of   between Google search and Android. Google Now was born in part from this relationship, but it extends beyond Google’s intelligent assistant. For example, if you search for directions in Google Maps in your desktop browser, you can   to start navigating on your handset in seconds. Here’s another great search integration that every Android user needs to know about: Say you misplaced your smartphone. Maybe you left it at work, or perhaps it’s at the gym in your locker.

"Obama to make first post-presidency public appearance in Chicago next week.      Former president Barack Obama will make his first public appearance since leaving office, breaking his   silence on Monday in Chicago just days before his successor marks his 100th day in office. Obama is scheduled to participate in a    event with young adults at the University of Chicago focused on community organizing and civic engagement, his office said Friday. The event is part of Obama’s goals to ”encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities around the country and the world,” his office said in a statement. It will mark the first in a series of public events for Obama, including stops next month in Boston to receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and in Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama has generally refrained from speaking out since he left the White House in January. In his final days in office, he expressed appreciation that his predecessor, George W. Bush, did not publicly   him and refrained from playing an active political role. Aides said Obama’s public appearance next week is not intended to boost his activism as a leader of the Democratic resistance to President Trump, who angered Obama supporters when he accused his predecessor of ordering a wiretap on Trump Tower during last year’s election campaign. Trump has offered no evidence to back up the claim, and U. S. intelligence agencies and congressional investigators have said they have found none. Obama has issued a statement objecting to Trump’s efforts to bar people from several   countries from entering the United States, saying through a spokesman that he ”fundamentally disagrees” with the ban. Two executive orders imposing such bans have been blocked by a federal judges. Obama also defended the Affordable Care Act last month when the Trump White House and House Republicans attempted, unsuccessfully, to craft a bill to overturn the law. And Obama spoke by phone this week with French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, although Obama did not make an endorsement in the race. Since leaving office, Obama has focused on building his foundation and beginning his memoir, along with taking some vacation time.  ",-0.5
"My dad wrote ‘Citizen Kane’ — not Orson Welles. Orson Welles wrote “not one word’’ of “Citizen Kane,’’ insists a posthumous memoir by a son of the man who shared a Best Original Screenplay with the director of the 1941 classic. Frank Mankiewicz  —   who was Robert F. Kennedy’s press secretary, ran George McGovern’s presidential campaign and   what became National Public Radio  —   writes in “So as I Was Saying . . . ” that his father, Herman Mankiewicz, agreed to a shared credit as a favor to Welles. The son strongly supports the findings of Pauline Kael, who famously minimized Welles’ contributions to the writing of the film in “Raising Kane,’’ a lengthy essay that originally ran in the New Yorker in 1971. Welles’ many biographers have disputed her conclusions, drawn largely from interviews with John Houseman and Rita Alexander, who helped Mankiewicz edit his overlong script. According to Kael and Frank Mankiewicz, his father made a preliminary application for credit to the Screen Writers Guild and was advised it would rule in favor of a sole credit for him if he filed for formal arbitration. Frank Mankiewicz  —   who became friends with Houseman  —   says his father changed his mind after Welles pleaded that his contract with RKO Pictures required him to write, direct and produce “Citizen Kane’’ to be paid. Welles’ defenders claim it was the studio that decided on the joint credit, and that the director magnanimously indicated by drawing an arrow on a piece of paper that Mankiewicz should be billed first. Frank Mankiewicz writes there was no doubt whatsoever in the mind of William Randolph Hearst  —   the newspaper tycoon on who Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, was primarily based  —   that Herman Mankiewicz, who had been an overnight guest at Hearst’s castle on the Pacific Coast several times (the inspiration for the film’s Xanadu estate) was responsible for the script. He writes that the infuriated Hearst used his political clout to have Herman Mankiewicz put on a trial for DUI after a fender bender that the son writes was “luridly’’ covered in the   Los Angeles Examiner. The son, who was stationed at a California army base, says he would buy all five copies of the paper from the post exchange and throw them in the trash every day during the trial. Frank Mankiewicz, who died in 2014, does call the film “Welles’ masterpiece. His acting performance is magnificent, his direction is near   . . . and his production touches were all of Academy Award quality. It’s his movie, marred only by a   over the script a few of his admirers and relatives choose to keep alive. ’’ Why are they doing this? “It is, I think, a piece of postmodernism before its time: the malleability of ‘truth’ to meet whatever needs we have,’’ Mankiewicz writes. “In this case, it is the need to see Orson Welles as one of the first great auteurs of movies . . . We need to believe a creative genius like Orson Welles can do it all. ’’ Frank Mankiewicz also disputes the legend that his dad provocatively named the film’s famous Rosebud sled after Hearst’s supposed nickname for a private part of his mistress, actress Marion Davies. The son writes that Rosebud was actually the brand of his dad’s first bicycle, stolen from in front of the   Pennsylvania, public library “the very first day my father had it’’  —   a theft that a researcher confirmed in police records from 1908. The father was traumatized because his parents refused to replace the bicycle and often discussed this with his psychoanalyst around the time he was writing “Citizen Kane. ’’ Welles, who never publicly disputed Kael’s book, presented Mankiewicz  —   who died in 1953  —   with a replica of the Rosebud sled at the film’s wrap party. It was sold by his son Don’s family at auction for $149, 000 last December. Frank Mankiewicz sold his father’s Oscar for $588, 455 in 2012. “The Oscar cost so much to insure that he kept it in a   box,’’ one of Frank Mankiewicz’ sons, TCM host Ben Mankiewicz,   at the time. (His other son is “Dateline NBC’’ correspondent Josh Mankiewicz.) “He figured that if we couldn’t see it, there was not much point in hanging on to it. ’’ ",1.0
"Controversial deal looms over Trump’s Treasury secretary pick. Wall Street investor and Hollywood producer Steven Mnuchin,   Donald Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, is likely to find his Senate confirmation process a bit stickier than he had hoped. One of the more controversial deals in his recent past is about to be   in the courts, sources tell The Post. RKA Film Financing, which had lent $75 million to Relativity Media, one of Tinseltown’s   studios and the producer of “Masterminds,” will soon file an amended complaint in Manhattan state court against Mnuchin and others alleging its was ripped off in a 2015 financing deal. The   old former Goldman Sachs executive and the others to be named in the suit were Relativity board members. RKA will claim the studio gave it false financial information, which led to it losing money on the deal, a source close to the situation said. State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos on Nov. 3 dismissed an earlier RKA suit over the same allegations but allowed the company to   the allegations if more properly constructed. Lawyers for Mnuchin said last year when RKA first filed the claims and again in the spring strongly denied the allegations. They will likely again find the claims without merit  —   but the lingering expected lawsuit could make Mnuchin’s Senate confirmation hearing early in 2017 a bit bumpy. RKA’s new complaint will allege fraud as opposed to the prior breach of contract allegation, the source said. . Mnuchin was an early backer of the    Republican candidate, to lead the Treasury Department. The bespectacled former finance chairman of Trump campaign is a clear Washington outsider. RKA alleged in its suit that in April 2015 Mnuchin, then Relativity’s     played a role in giving it false assurances about the studio’s financial health. The $75 million was only to be used on print and advertising, and not general corporate expenses, RKA was told, according to the first lawsuit. In arguing against the merits of the   suit earlier this year, Mnuchin’s lawyer said that since his client joined the Relativity board three months after RKA invested its $75 million he couldn’t have defrauded the company. Soon after the RKA loan, in July 2015, Relativity, headed by Ryan Kavanaugh, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. RKA lost millions because of the Chapter 11. At the same time, OneWest Bank Group, where Mnuchin was chairman and chief executive, recouped its entire $50 million loan just prior to the filing. OneWest was a senior lender  —   RKA was not. In the suit that was dismissed, RKA sought $110 million from the defendants. Mnuchin’s lawyer declined comment on the possibility that RKA would soon   its suit.",1.0
"Astronaut John Glenn loved watching sunsets in space.  In space, even the ordinary and the ugly takes on a new sense of wonder. When John Glenn was orbiting the Earth  —   the first American ever to do so  —   he noticed something strange and beautiful outside of his Friendship 7 spacecraft.     ”I’m in a big mass of thousands of very small particles that are brilliantly lit up like they’re luminescent,” Glenn radioed during the flight. ”They are bright  . About the size and intensity of a firefly on a real dark night. I’ve never seen anything like it.” In reality, those particles were most likely just Glenn’s own sweat or urine being vented from the spacecraft, glittering, frozen in sunlight. When you’re one of the first few humans to travel into space, even the tiniest things are worth marveling at.  When Glenn returned to Earth on February 20, 1962, and spoke to reporters in a press conference, he didn’t talk much about his fears, about the danger, about the arduousness of the flight.     Instead, Glenn, who died Thursday at the age of 95, went on and on about the beauty and awe of spaceflight. “It was quite a day,” he said, according to the New York Times’s account. “I don’t know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets. ”    During the press conference, he kept coming back to the sunsets, saying they were “the most impressive thing that you   …     see in orbital flight. ” He added: “These are of very brilliantly colored hue and the colors stretch out  —   way out  —   from the sun for the horizon. ” Then after the sun is down, he said, “certainly one of the most beautiful things is to be on the dark side with the full moon out. ” Glenn was also enamored of the feeling of zero gravity. “It sounds like I was an addict to it, and I think I probably am,” he said. “It was a wonderful feeling”     And Glenn knew these sights and feelings were just the beginning  —   and that greater achievements in human spaceflight were yet to come. “I think we’ve really hardly scratched the surface,” he said. “We had a lot of attention focused on this one right now, but our efforts haven’t really gotten us very far into space, if you think about it. ”  He then explained that if his height represented the diameter of the Earth, his orbit would have been just a few inches above his head.  So perhaps if you think of the enormity of space it makes our efforts seems puny at this time. But these are all    functions we go through. As we said, all the manned space flights we’ve had to date have added information. This flight, I hope, added a little bit more and there are more to come.    Astronauts are still marveling at the beauty of spaceflight, and seeing sunsets and the Earth from the International Space Station. And today’s crop of astronauts, like Glenn, are just small part of a great exploration that’s yet to come.              ",-1.0
"""No one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim"": Aung San Suu Kyi’s Rohingya problem.  In October 2013, one of the most celebrated political dissidents in the world sat down for an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain, and it didn’t go great.    Aung San Suu Kyi was, at that point, still in the process of transitioning from a Nobel Peace Prize —  winning political prisoner of Myanmar’s military government  —   she was kept under house arrest until 2010  —   to the country’s de facto leader. After being freed as part of her country’s opening, her political party won a number of seats in limited 2012 parliamentary elections. Later, in November 2015, her political party would win a landslide in the country’s first real elections in decades. While she herself is barred from becoming president, she picked a close ally and is widely considered the real power behind the newly democratic government. As of October 2013, that was still two years off, but it seemed clear that Aung San Suu Kyi was becoming rapidly more important in her country’s politics. So Husain, rightly, pressed Aung San Suu Kyi on a political challenge she was not handling well: acts of   ethnic cleansing, often abetted or encouraged by government forces, against an ethnic minority known as the Rohingya, who are also Muslim.    For all her heroism in fighting for democracy in Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi has always been bad on this issue, decrying the violence but also refusing to acknowledge its scale or the government’s role, often taking a baffling ”both sides” stance. And she was rarely worse than in her interview with Husain, where she became defensive, downplayed the crisis, and appeared to put some blame on the victims:  That interview again made news on Friday, when British media reported that, according to a new book on Aung San Suu Kyi, she was so angered by the interview’s focus on Rohingya that afterward she was heard muttering, presumably to an aide, ”No one told me I was going to be interviewed by a Muslim.” The comment is being treated as further proof that Aung San Suu Kyi may not be the beacon of hope the world had thought her to be; that her weakness on the Rohingya crisis, in addition to being terrible in its own right, is symptomatic of larger problems with how she thinks about important issues of diversity and tolerance.    At the risk of sounding like I am defending her (I am not) it’s worth putting her comment in the context of how identity is discussed in her country versus in ours. In British or American society, such a comment is considered unacceptable, both for reducing the BBC’s Mishal Husain to her religion and for implying that being ”interviewed by a Muslim” is different from being interviewed by any other kind of journalist. In Myanmar, and in many countries where sectarian politics are more pronounced and discussed more openly, it is common to assume that people will act primarily as members of their ethnoreligious group.    Indeed, a journalist friend from Myanmar will often identify himself, in questions, as a member of the Karen ethnic minority, signaling that he is writing on behalf of Karen interests. I have seen, in Yangon, Aung San Suu Kyi questioned by a journalist who identified himself as Muslim and clearly considered that salient to his coverage and question. That’s not to condone this system, but rather to note that, within this context, Aung Sang Suu Kyi’s comment becomes, while not more defensible, more comprehensible. She is accustomed to seeing journalists as representatives of their ethnoreligious communities, (wrongly) concluded that this explained Husain’s questions on Rohingya, and chastised her staff for not preparing her. But the point is that her comment feeds into an entirely correct impression that Aung San Suu Kyi wants to lead Myanmar but is unwilling to stand up for the Rohingya who are its most vulnerable citizens. Rohingya, of whom there are about a million in the country, are typically not even considered to be legal citizens of Myanmar. (The question I saw a Muslim reporter ask her in Yangon was over whether she would change this; her reply was vague but implied that she would not.) They are thus denied social services and legal recourse. And throughout much of 2013, they were victims of mass killings and forced relocations, often abetted by local government and military officials that encourage the violence or decline to stop it. Many now live in camps or have attempted to flee the country as refugees, though the journey is dangerous and often deadly.   violence and discrimination goes back decades in Myanmar; hostility toward Rohingya is pervasive. (While Western coverage often characterizes this as purely about religion, there are many   Muslims in the country, and they tend to be treated much better.)    In my trip to Myanmar, even in meetings with     democracy activists  —   people who had sacrificed years of their lives fighting the military regime for civil rights  —   I heard, with disturbing frequency, people describe the Rohingya as untrustworthy foreigners who had to be controlled or expelled for the good of the nation. This problem, in other words, is deeply rooted in Myanmar society, which is only just beginning to emerge from decades of military dictatorship, with all the paranoia and   nationalism that brings. And that naturally leads some observers to wonder whether Aung San Suu Kyi believes that she needs to take a     position on the Rohingya issue; that it’s only by indulging   fears that Myanmar’s Buddhists will consider her credible on the issue and thus heed her calls for calm. Another common interpretation is that Aung San Suu Kyi has simply made a cold political calculation to avoid the Rohingya issue, which would be politically costly and distract from other issues such as reforming the country’s economy and eroding the military’s   hold on power. As a third possibility, many observers, with reason, suspect that she is simply personally unsympathetic or even hostile toward the Rohingya and their plight. ”I thought it was worth including in the book because it just feeds into the ambiguity of her position regarding this issue,” Peter Popham, the journalist whose book reports this new quote, told the Telegraph.    ”One has great admiration for her and her life story and courage, but nobody believes anymore that she is a person without any faults and without her own prejudices and limitations.” There is probably some degree of truth to all three of these possible interpretations. And it is worthwhile debating what explains Aung San Suu Kyi’s continued failure to stand up for the Rohingya, and what this tells us about her. But in any interpretation, her failure is symptomatic of something much larger than herself: a social and political climate in Myanmar, riven for decades by armed conflict between ethnic groups, in which the nation’s least powerful minority is vulnerable to not just hateful rhetoric but active ethnic cleansing. Aung San Suu Kyi, whether she is a calculating politician or a canny mediator or personally hateful toward Rohingya, is a product of this climate. It’s easy to personalize entire countries, especially countries that don’t get much coverage in the West, down to their most famous political figure. But even paramount leaders are products of their societies, not the other way around. That’s not an argument for absolving her of responsibility  —   quite the opposite; it goes to show how important it is that she try to change this climate  —   but rather a reminder that problems such as ethnic cleansing tend to go much deeper than the sorts of language a political leader uses in her interviews with the BBC.

"Russian delegation in Syria’s ancient Palmyra marks liberation from Islamic State.   PALMYRA, Syria  —   At an ancient Roman amphitheater where just months ago the Islamic State staged mass beheadings, Russia on Thursday deployed a celebrated conductor and a renowned cellist on a cultural offensive to mark the liberation of Palmyra and re inforce Russia’s role in Syria. In place of the warplanes and special forces  fighting here in March, President Vladimir Putin sent the Mariinsky Orchestra led by conductor Valery Gergiev and joined by cellist Sergei Roldugin, one of Putin’s close friends and a subject of recent leaks about secret offshore holdings. The symbolism was lost on no one. Speaking by video link from Moscow, Putin told the gathering that the world should unite behind Syria to restore the historical site as a sign of hope in the battle against terrorism. It was an odd moment of manufactured optics aimed at public vindication of Russia’s role in this   conflict that has killed 250, 000 people and displaced millions who have sought asylum in neighboring countries of the Middle East and in Europe. But U. S. critics and others see the intervention as an effort to prop up the autocratic Syrian leader Bashar  . And the Russian cultural entourage was another show of support for  Assad amid mounting Western pressures to make political concessions to help end the nation’s civil war.   Russian warplanes took off from the Hmeymim airbase in Syria on March 16, flying back to their permanent bases in Russia as Moscow withdraws forces from the   region. (Reuters)   Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s culture minister and the   official to visit Palmyra on Thursday, had sharp words of condemnation for the West. “The world community extremely neglectfully treated the threat of ISIS and international terrorism and, it seems to me, should now atone for its guilt by helping to save what can still be saved,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “What was done here can only be compared with what the fascists did in Russia,” Medinsky said. “It is amazing that the lot of the Russian soldiers in all times in history has been to save world culture from destruction. ” The liberation of Palmyra and its    ruins has become a centerpiece in Moscow’s public defense of its Syrian intervention, an ambitious venture in which Russia has sent thousands of troops and planes overseas in the country’s first military intervention outside the former Soviet Union since the disastrous Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In a carefully guided exhibition of its successes in the Syrian conflict, Russia flew in more than 100 international journalists, shuttling them to its Khmeimim air base in Latakia and to Palmyra, a desert city recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  [Syrian leader gets breathing room with Russia’s help]  Palmyra was recaptured in late March by Syrian soldiers backed by Russian airstrikes  —   a success that Moscow says demonstrates its leadership in the fight against the Islamic State.   But Russia has also come under intense criticism from the West and its allies for offen sives that have targeted   rebel factions, including some backed by Washington. A recent surge of violence by both sides in the strategic northern city of Aleppo has killed more than 250 people, including more than 50 in an airstrike last week on a hospital in a   area. The battles further eroded international efforts to impose a   between Syrian and opposition  forces. Assad, in a letter to Putin, vowed to prevail in Aleppo and drew comparisons to Stalingrad’s “heroic” resistance to a siege by German troops in World War II, the Associated Press reported.  In the northwestern province of Idlib, meanwhile, airstrikes killed at least 28 people Thursday in a camp for internally displaced people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The   monitoring group said the death toll  —   which includes women and children  —   is expected to rise. It was unclear who carried out the attack, although Syria’s government and Russia operate warplanes over the area, which is held by rebels opposed to Assad. The strikes follow an apparent agreement Wednesday between the United States and Russia to broker a new   for Aleppo. Activists and rebels in the city say the agreement appears to have reduced the fighting there but not completely stopped it. A nationwide   backed by the two powers in February all but collapsed in large part because of clashes  in Aleppo, a city divided between government and rebel control.  [An ancient city defaced by modern scourge of Islamic State]  In Palmyra, Medinsky, the culture minister, joined Russia’s representative to UNESCO, Eleonora Mitrofanova, in viewing the damage caused by Islamic State militants across the site, spread over a desert plain about 140 miles northeast of Damascus. Later, Russian musicians gathered amid the antiquities for a concert of Bach and other pieces featuring Gergiev and Roldugin. The cellist was among prominent Russians named last month in the Panama Papers  —   leaked files about secret offshore holdings. Roldugin has said he served only as a middleman for wealthy Russians buying expensive musical instruments. Putin, in his remarks by video link, cited “hope not just for the revival of Palmyra as a cultural heritage for all humanity but for the deliverance of modern civilization from this terrible malady of international terrorism. ” Mitrofanova said a full assessment of the Palmyra damage is underway and called on world leaders to put aside political differences to help restore the site. She spoke to a group that included envoys from China and Brazil and other representatives from Africa, Asia and South America. “If certain countries continue this   game, that we love our shared cultural heritage but don’t love Assad, I think it will turn out badly” for the restoration of Palmyra, Mitrofanova said. The push by Syrian soldiers into the   ruins of Palmyra captured a hugely significant prize for the forces  of Assad and their Russian allies  —   rich in propaganda value for both sides. But it also brought sad images of the ravages by the Islamic State against some of the world’s most famous antiquities, including statues, a    lion carving and the temples of Baalshamin and Bel.  [How Russia reshaped the fight in Syria]  During the Islamic State’s hold on Palmyra, its fighters also used the site’s amphitheater for summary executions. Among the victims was Khaled Asaad, the retired director of Palmyra’s museum and considered among the leading scholars of the area. After taking over Palmyra in May 2015, the Islamic State began destroying some ancient monuments, including the   Temple of Bel and the Arch of Triumph, which a Roman emperor built in about A. D. 200.  Still, Syrian archaeological officials say most of the site was either untouched or had relatively minor damage, such as gunfire pockmarks, that can be repaired by restorers. Islamic State militants have destroyed other   antiquities in Syria and Iraq, including renowned artifacts and sculptures in the museum in Mosul, the group’s stronghold in northern Iraq.  Hugh Naylor in Beirut and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report.  Read more:   [Weeks after ‘pullout’ from Syria, Russian military is as busy as ever]   U.

"McDonald’s movies at the center of Hollywood legal drama. A Hollywood production company is not lovin’ the fact that a strikingly similar film was released by The Weinstein Company just a week after “The Founder,” which tells the story of the man who put McDonald’s on the map. Speedee Distribution poured $25 million into   “The Founder” with the Weinsteins, according to a new Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit over the competing releases. The first drama, about struggling businessman Ray Kroc’s acquisition of the fast food giant, was released on Jan. 20. Despite an agreement to wait over a week to put out any other   motion picture, The Weinstein Company released “Gold”  —   about another struggling businessman, this one on his journey to discover gold in the Indonesia jungle  —   on Jan. 27, according to court papers. Both flicks are based on true stories, star   leading male actors  —   Michael Keaton in “The Founder” and Matthew McConaughey in “Gold”  —   and involve men manipulating their way to wealth, the suit says. They had earlier limited theatrical releases in December to qualify for consideration in the Academy Awards. “‘The Founder’ and ‘Gold’ both appeal to the same audience,” Speedee Distribution says in the suit. “The two films have been marketed to potential moviegoers in the same way on TV, print and online, conveying an effective binary choice to the viewer: to see one movie or the other,” the suit says. It includes an example of ads in the New York Times for the movie on opposite facing pages.   Speedee Distribution is suing for $15 million, the amount it says it spent on advertising for “The Founder. ” Reps for the Weinsteins did not immediately return a request for comment.",1.0

"There’s still time to save the Puerto Rican Day Parade — just dump the terrorist. It’s raining on New York City’s June 11 Puerto Rican Day Parade. Shockingly, this year’s parade organizers decided to honor Oscar López Rivera, convicted in 1981 for his part in terrorist attacks ostensibly on behalf of the cause of Puerto Rican independence. López Rivera and his comrades caused death, serious injury and property damage. Their victims were both NYPD officers and civilians. It’s not too late for parade officials to do the right thing and find someone more worthy of the honor. To justify honoring him, parade organizers fell back on the excuse that López Rivera didn’t personally bomb anything  —   he merely conspired to overthrow the US government and transported explosives. They also suggested, without evidence, that a boycott of the parade is “orchestrated” by “an   ” element or by “   Latinos” who favor Puerto Rican statehood. What nonsense. This mess rests at the feet of the parade organizers, who decided to have a convicted felon  —   whose   jail sentence was commuted to 35 years by President Barack Obama, but was not pardoned or exonerated as wrongfully convicted  —   as the symbol of Puerto Rico’s national pride in order to make a political statement about statehood. They turned a joyous event into an embarrassing spectacle. So, where are our political leaders? A few key officials will be absent from the festivities: Sen. Charles Schumer (conveniently out of town for the parade) Gov. Andrew Cuomo (no comment was his initial comment for his  ) acting Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez  —   who proudly wants to be Brooklyn’s first Puerto Rican district attorney (not attending, campaign activities in Brooklyn)  —   and others are boycotting this major parade they would otherwise mandatorily attend. Yet even in their   they aren’t exactly profiles in courage. They should state unequivocally that the parade organizers acted against the best interests of the city and the Puerto Rican community. The political equivalent of “The dog ate my homework” won’t suffice this time. Some advice to our boycotting public officials: Be courageous. Don’t boycott  —   march separately! Shun López Rivera and the politically motivated parade organizers. (This applies also to Mayor Bill de Blasio and other public officials who plan to march: No arms out, embracing López Rivera.) Alternatively, walk the parade’s sidewalks’ route  —   shake hands as you go  —   join and support the millions of Puerto Ricans who will enthusiastically line Fifth Avenue. Controversy isn’t new to New York parades  —   including the Puerto Rican Day Parade  —   but in the past, officials took a stand when an honoree or grand marshal was an extreme or embarrassing choice. In 1983, after the St. Patrick’s Day Parade organizers selected Michael Flannery, a supporter of the Irish Republican Army’s   violence, as the parade’s grand marshal, Cardinal Terrence Cooke refused to greet Flannery, as is traditional, when he marched past St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Although former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Gov. Hugh Carey boycotted the parade because of Flannery’s IRA involvement,  . Mario Cuomo (“out of respect for the history and tradition of  ”) Mayor Ed Koch (“I urge everyone who loves the Irish to march with me”) Sen. Al D’Amato and other public officials still marched. In 2010, the Puerto Rican Day Parade organizers’ grand marshal withdrew after it was revealed he was convicted and sentenced to three months for domestic violence in 2003. Parade organizers defused that controversy by replacing the grand marshal with singer Marc Anthony. It’s not too late to fix this. Parade organizers must remove their political blinders and take a lesson from 2010: Withdraw López Rivera as its   honoree. The Puerto Rican community deserves the same “respect” and “love” from our present public officials who have attended countless other New York City ethnic parades and feasts. For this parade, there must be solidarity behind the call “Everyone who loves Puerto Ricans, march” to reject this indefensible attempt to rain on the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  ",1.0
"The invisible tax on teachers of color.    John King is U. S. education secretary.       One of my top priorities as education secretary is to help our public schools serve the needs of our increasingly diverse students so that they have the opportunity to pursue the American dream and use their talents to help our nation tackle some of its most difficult problems.  To achieve this goal, we need a teaching force that is as diverse as our students. More and more research shows that diversity isn’t just a nicety  —   it’s a real contributor to better outcomes in our schools, workplaces and communities. But while students of color are now a majority in our schools, teachers of color make up only 18 percent of their faculties. Unless we do something as a country, demographic projections show that this mismatch is likely to get worse. To address this, we need to encourage a wider array of young people to consider teaching as a career, prepare them to meet the learning needs of their diverse students and actively recruit and hire them. But we also must do more to ensure that, once hired, they will stay. Research conducted recently by the American Federation of Teachers found that, while more teachers of color are being hired than in the past, they also are leaving the profession more quickly than white teachers. Improved compensation and working conditions can help address this, of course. But one factor in teachers’ decisions to leave deserves special attention: the “invisible tax. ”  According to some African American male teachers, the “invisible tax” is imposed on them when they are the only or one of only a few nonwhite male educators in the building. It is paid, for example, when these teachers, who make up only 2 percent of the teaching force nationally, are expected to serve as school disciplinarians based on an assumption that they will be better able to communicate with African American boys with behavior issues.  It is also paid when they have to be on high alert to prepare their students for racism outside of school. “Every time I take my students to an engineering competition, or to speak with industry partners, or to tour colleges, I have to have the   talk,” explained Harry Preston, an African American physics teacher in Baltimore. “That is a mental tax I personally pay as an educator. ” And it is paid when teachers of color are seen as the experts on any question of cultural diversity.  The tax takes a toll on teachers’ time. Building and maintaining relationships with students across an entire school adds to their already busy schedules as teachers. It also takes an emotional toll. Often, the students whom black male teachers are expected to help have serious needs beyond what any individual teacher can remedy. That leads to burnout.   John B. King Jr. thanks President Obama after being named U. S. secretary of education. (The White   Youtube)   Sharif   principal of the Mastery Charter School’s Shoemaker campus in Philadelphia, has noted that the African American teachers he speaks with are of two minds about these extra duties. “They feel honored and appreciated that they are asked,” he said, “but when so many different people are asking them for help, it becomes a burden. ” Such conversations prompted   to found the Fellowship, which seeks to inspire more men of color in Philadelphia to see teaching as a means of achieving social justice. The Fellowship has hosted several Black Male Educator Convening events to provide peer support and guidance.  At these gatherings, teachers express a desire to be seen as experts for their mastery of subjects they teach or for their innovative teaching, as well as for any special connection they might have to students. They want to be seen as a resource for white colleagues to learn how to better support their African American students. “If everyone was asked to improve their relationships with these students . . . it would feel empowering,”   said. I encourage school and district leaders to work with their teachers and other staff members to develop a vision for how to make their campuses more inclusive by adopting proactive hiring processes, providing professional support, using a multicultural curriculum and offering cultural competence workshops for everyone. The burden to end this tax shouldn’t fall only to the people already paying it. We have strong evidence that students of color benefit from having teachers who are positive role models, as well as from the changes in classroom dynamics that result. Teachers of color often have higher expectations for students of color, are more likely to use culturally relevant teaching practices, are more likely to confront racism in their lessons and, yes, also serve as advocates.  But it’s also important for our white students to see teachers of color in leadership roles in their classrooms and communities. Breaking down negative stereotypes helps all students learn to live and work in a multiracial society. Ultimately, the work we can do together to create opportunity for all students will determine not only the kind of economy we have and the kind of people we will be, but also whether we will become the nation we ought to be.

"Puerto Rico’s Slow-Motion Medical Disaster. Hurricane Maria left a ruined island and 16 Puerto Rico residents dead. But public health experts worry that figure could climb higher in the coming weeks, as many on the island fail to get medicines or treatment they need for chronic diseases. Roads are blocked, supplies are stuck at the ports, and only 49 of Puerto Rico’s 69 hospitals are open. Doctors at one children’s hospital were forced to discharge 40 patients this week when their generator ran out of diesel fuel. But the immediate need for treatment is only the beginning of the island's public health challenges. With the island’s entire power grid knocked out, Puerto Rico’s massive pharmaceutical manufacturing industry—which provides 30 percent of the island’s gross domestic product and 90,000 jobs—has been shut down. FDA administrator Scott Gottlieb announced  this week that his agency is trying to shift production to the mainland US to prevent shortages of cancer drugs, immunosuppressants for transplant patients, and medical devices for diabetes patients. Bringing Puerto Rico back online will make a big difference for people living both on—and off—the island. In the short term, energy is essential to keeping patients alive. Medicines like insulin to treat diabetes or tetanus vaccines need to be kept cool. That means either in a refrigerator at 45 degrees Fahrenheit (for seasonal flu or tetanus vaccines) or at room temperature, which is about 72 degrees (for insulin). But without air conditioning, Puerto Rico’s tropical climate is hitting the upper 80s this week. “Refrigeration and cold storage are really big issues, and will be for the forseeable future,” says one former federal emergency response official who asked not to be identified. The patients most affected by the failing cold chain will be those with chronic conditions. One-fifth of Puerto Rico's population has some kind of disability, including half of those above age 65. Its 3.5 million residents have the highest prevalence of diabetes in the United States—nearly 13 percent compared to 8.7 percent on the US mainland. That helps make Puerto Rico the most vulnerable US territory to a natural disaster like Hurricane Maria, according to a recent study by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers . Federal health officials say they are already seeing patients come into emergency clinics with chronic disease related problems.
“People with the most dire need are dialysis patients,” says Lt. Cmdr. Garrett Martin-Yeboah of the US Public Health Service and the national clinical pharmacist to the Department of Health and Human Service’s assistant secretary for emergency preparedness and response. “They are on a good number of prescription medications. Because of the volume of medications and tenuousness of their condition, those are some of the patients we are concerned about.” The immediate refrigeration problem is solvable. Martin-Yeboah said a squad of federal emergency care doctors who were stationed on the island before Maria struck brought battery-powered mini-fridges that can run four days without power. They also brought their own diesel generators—though a week after the storm left, there is still not enough fuel to run them. “There are some challenges in Puerto Rico with fuel and things like that,” says Martin-Yeboah, who coordinates medicines and supplies for HHS doctors. “We’ve had to go to the airport to retrieve medical supplies,” she says. “Our suppliers can get them to Puerto Rico, but can’t get it to the site.” The Navy hospital ship Comfort, which was finally dispatched this week, may also help in the short-term, especially for trauma patients. The converted supertanker will bring 1,000 beds, 12 operating rooms, a CAT-scan, and radiology capabilities to Puerto Rico. Meanwhie, emergency responders are using ham radios to reach some communities and even considering air-dropping medicines into villages, according to Nicolette Louissaint, executive director of Healthcare Ready, a group that coordinates post-disaster medical supply chain between public agencies and private suppliers such as pharmacies and drug manufacturers. “The most important part is how we support the patients,” Louissaint says. “These disaster responses are massive logistical operations. We have to do unusual things. Folks are looking at how you can get up to the mountains, and what solutions to move medicines to people but also people to medicines.” Louissaint noted that less than 10 percent of the island’s pharmacies were open as of Wednesday. Overall, there is no panic over medicines, according to health officials working in Puerto Rico. But they are prepared for the situation to worsen if conditions don’t improve quickly. Chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes are often not counted in the final toll of natural disasters like Hurricane Maria. “These people end up dying from things that are preventable under ordinary circumstances,” said the former federal emergency official. “That’s what is going to start happening.” But long-term, the effects of Puerto Rico's collapse may ripple far beyond the island. Twelve of the top 20 global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have manufacturing facilities on the island, according to the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company. As a result, Puerto Rico manufactures seven of the top 10 drugs sold globally including AstraZeneca's cholesterol treatment Crestor, Abbvie arthritis drug Humira, and Johnson & Johnson-owned HIV drug Prezista, USA Today reported. Those three companies have said supplies of their drugs are in good shape and drugmakers are working to get production up and running. Still, Puerto Rico officials say it may be months before the island's power grid is fixed.",0.0
"The 12 Days of Christmas: the story behind the holiday’s most annoying carol.  It might seem unbelievable given that the radio has been blasting Christmas tunes since Thanksgiving, but the true Christmas season actually starts on Christmas Day itself. That’s right: December 25 marks the official start of the 12 days of Christmas, the Christian tradition that shares its name with a relentlessly     Christmas carol.    Here are a few things you may not have known about the song and the season. What are the 12 days of Christmas? The 12 days of Christmas is the period that in Christian theology marks the span between the birth of Christ and the coming of the Magi  —   the three wise men. It begins on December 25 (Christmas) and runs through January 6 (the Epiphany, sometimes also called Three Kings’ Day). Additionally, the four weeks preceding Christmas are collectively known as Advent, which begins four Sundays before Christmas and ends on December 24.   Related Advent, explained    Some families choose to mark the   period by observing the feast days of various saints (including St. Stephen on December 26) and planning daily   activities, but for many, after December 25 things go back to business as usual.    ”The 12 Days of Christmas” is also a Christmas carol in which the singer brags about all the cool gifts they received from their ”true love” during the 12 days of Christmas. Each verse builds on the previous one, serving as a really effective way to annoy family members on road trips.    The lyrics to ”The 12 Days of Christmas” have changed over the years The version most people are familiar with today begins with this verse:  On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me A partridge in a pear tree.     The song then adds a gift for each day, building on the verse before it, until you’re reciting all 12 gifts together: Day 2: two turtle doves Day 3: three French hens Day 4: four calling birds Day 5: five gold rings Day 6: six geese   Day 7: seven swans   Day 8: eight maids   Day 9: nine ladies dancing Day 10: 10 lords   Day 11: 11 pipers piping Day 12: 12 drummers drumming The history of the carol is somewhat murky. The earliest known version first appeared in a 1780 children’s book called Mirth   Mischief. (A first edition of that book sold for $23, 750 at a Sotheby’s auction in 2014, but you can also buy a digital copy on Amazon.) Some historians think the song could be French in origin, but most agree it was designed as a ”  ” game, in which singers tested their recall of the lyrics and had to award their opponents a ”forfeit”  —   a kiss or a favor of some kind  —   if they made a mistake. Many variations of the lyrics have existed at different points; some mention ”bears  ” or ”ships  ”; some name the singer’s mother as the gift giver instead of their true love. Early versions list four ”colly” birds, an archaic term meaning black as coal (blackbirds, in other words). And some people theorize that the five gold rings actually refer to the markings of a   pheasant, which would align with the bird motif of the early verses.    In any case, the song most of us are familiar with today comes from an English composer named Frederic Austin; in 1909, he set the melody and lyrics (including changing ”colly” to ”calling”) and added as his own flourish the   cadence of ”five   rings.” The song is not a coded primer on Christianity One popular theory that’s made the internet rounds is that the lyrics to ”The 12 Days of Christmas” are coded references to Christianity; it posits that the song was written to help Christians learn and pass on the tenets of their faith while avoiding persecution. Under that theory, the various gifts break down as follows, as the   website Snopes explained:  2 Turtle Doves = The Old and New Testaments 3 French Hens = Faith, Hope and Charity, the Theological Virtues 4 Calling Birds = the Four Gospels   the Four Evangelists 5 Golden Rings = The first Five Books of the Old Testament, the ”Pentateuch,” which gives the history of man’s fall from grace. 6 Geese   = the six days of creation 7 Swans   = the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven sacraments 8 Maids   = the eight beatitudes 9 Ladies Dancing = the nine Fruits of the Holy Spirit 10 Lords   = the ten commandments 11 Pipers Piping = the eleven faithful apostles 12 Drummers Drumming = the twelve points of doctrine in the Apostle’s Creed  The partridge in the pear tree, of course, represents Jesus Christ. This theory seems   for circulation via chain emails, but it actually makes little sense once you examine it. Snopes has a great explanation of the many, many holes in its logic. The most damning: First, the song’s gifts have nothing to do with their Christian ”equivalents,” so the song is basically useless as a way to remember key tenets of the faith. And second, if Christians were so restricted from practicing their faith that they had to conceal messages in a song, they also wouldn’t be able to celebrate Christmas in the first place  —   much less sing Christmas carols. The late historian William Studwell, known for his Christmas carol expertise, also refuted the coded message idea. Via a Northern Illinois University news release:     First, Catholics of that era were not terribly persecuted, so there would have been little need for their teachings to have been secretive. Also, the breezy, bouncy nature of the tune hardly fits with the character of the church at that time. Finally, neither Studwell, nor any other reputable researcher, has never found a definitive explanation of what each of the 12 gifts in the song would have correlated to in the Catholic catechism.  Sorry to spoil your dinner party fun fact; while I’m at it, I might as well tell you ”Ring Around the Rosie” isn’t about the Black Plague, either. Giving someone all the gifts in the song would be . .. pricey To calculate the cost of all the gifts in ”The 12 Days of Christmas,” I’ll turn to the PNC financial services group’s annual Christmas Price Index, which PNC has been putting out since 1984 (and which occasionally makes its way into school lesson plans). The index calculates the cost of all the gifts in the song based on current market rates; 2016’s total comes to a hefty $34, 363. 49, or $156, 507. 88 if you count each mention of an item separately (which would amount to 364 gifts in all).           The takeaway: Swans are damn expensive (at $1, 875  $13, 125 for all seven) while the five gold rings ($750 total) are a relative bargain, thanks to gold’s steady price since last year. Then again, actually giving someone all this stuff is probably not a great idea; just think of all the bird poo.         Are there any other versions of ”The 12 days of Christmas”? The structure of ”The 12 Days of Christmas” lends itself perfectly to parodies, of which there have been many. There’s Jeff Foxworthy’s redneck version, Twisted Sister’s heavy metal take, and, of course, a Muppets version (featuring John Denver):  There’s also a 12 days of Christmas diet of sorts, which the Atlantic’s Olga Khazan attempted in 2013. She calculated the calories in a serving of each bird mentioned in the song, and offset them with the calories burned by the various activities (milking, leaping, etc. ). Turns out all that poultry is somehow less indulgent than the typical American holiday meal. She sums up:     If you ate all of the birds in one day, including the pheasant pie, but not including all the trimmings for the other dishes, and subtracted the energy you expended milking, dancing, leaping, and drumming, you’d have consumed 2, 384 net calories. That’s really not bad, considering the average American Thanksgiving dinner adds up to about 4, 500 calories.  It seems even more reasonable, relatively speaking, when you consider that if you wanted to burn off your meal by just singing its namesake tune, you’d have to make it all the way through roughly 300 times  —   about 17 and a half hours of caroling. And that’s a gift we doubt anyone would welcome. ",-1.0
"What happens when a top privacy and security regulator falls for an email scam.      Most of us would probably prefer that nobody found out if we got hacked. Not so for Julie Brill, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who really wants you to know about the time she fell for an email phishing scam. ”These are not the    types of attacks of the past that we’re used to,” Brill said in a recent interview. ”These are deeply sophisticated.” Phishing scams can affect anyone  —   even, as it turns out,   federal officials whose whole jobs revolve around regulating corporate data security practices. The irony isn’t lost on Brill, who is trying to turn her personal story into an object lesson for consumers like you and me. As Brill tells it, the saga began earlier this year. A business contact of hers  —   Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge  —   sent her an email with an   Google Drive attachment. But after clicking on the link and entering in some of her personal information on the resulting page, she soon realized the truth: This was not a Google site at all. Instead, online criminals had muscled their way into Kimmelman’s email account and begun sending fake emails in his name to everyone in the account’s address book. (I, too, got a fraudulent email from Kimmelman’s attackers.) ”I was busy, I saw an email from this person, I opened it, tried to interface with it,” said Brill. ”And I pretty soon realized this was a false email from [someone] who was trying to get my data.”   [Three ways to step up your own cloud security]   Luckily, even though Brill had given out some of that data, she had made sure that the criminals wouldn’t be able to hijack her own accounts. She’d taken advantage of   authentication, a security measure that prevents someone from logging into a website unless they can also reproduce a special code sent to a separate device such as your mobile phone.   or   verification has been adopted by Google, Amazon and other major websites to combat the rise of digital fraud. The loss of information took place on Brill’s personal computer, so nothing in the FTC’s systems was affected, she said. But she did consult with the agency’s IT managers. ”Once they found out I had   authentication and I had changed some passwords, they were comforted that I had done all that I could do,” said Brill. ”If it had been an attack on our systems, they would have jumped into high gear right away.” So how did the hackers break into Kimmelman’s address book in the first place? That mystery may never be solved. ”It was either a random hack, or someone   …     knew those on my contact list would expect me to have secret documents to share,” Kimmelman joked in an email. ”If not a random hack, my reputation may be ruined!” Kimmelman has since switched email accounts. Brill is leaving the FTC at the end of the month to enter the private sector  —   a decision that was unrelated to this incident. But her imminent departure makes this an opportune time to highlight the risks of not having   authentication enabled for your sensitive online accounts. ”I say to groups, ’How many of you have   authentication?’ and I don’t see enough hands,” said Brill. ”So I say to folks, ’If you get nothing else out of this talk, please go home and turn on   authentication.’ ”",-0.5
"Bringing down the high cost of textbooks.  EVERY YEAR, college students shell out thousands of dollars for tuition. Then they face an additional cost: textbooks. Students spend as much as $1, 300 over their college careers on books alone  —   a burden that falls most heavily on those who have to take out loans to pay. A pilot program from a community college reform group just outside Washington, D. C. could help. Education advocacy group Achieving the Dream this month announced $9. 8 million in grants for developing degree programs that use online,   materials instead of pricey printed books. The initiative takes advantage of teaching resources in the public domain to cut costs for at least 76, 000 students at 38 community colleges in 13 states. One of those is in Maryland, and six are in Virginia. Textbook prices have soared in the past decade, rising 82 percent between 2003 and 2013  —   almost three times the rate of inflation. It doesn’t help that some publishers release new editions of their textbooks each year, so students looking for a required text can’t buy used. Those financial barriers force students to fall behind in their classes, lowering their grades and raising withdrawal rates. Textbook costs pose problems everywhere, but they do the most damage at community colleges, which draw a larger share of disadvantaged students. OpenStax, a nonprofit that produces     textbooks, estimates it has saved more than $66 million for nearly 700, 000 students  —   over half of those in the past year. Though some of those students attend community colleges, the majority study at   institutions. By focusing on   programs, Achieving the Dream hopes to fix the hole that most needs a patch  —   not just for the schools it funds, but also for other colleges that adopt the programs its grantees will develop.  It’s important work, and it’s hard: When your product is free, there’s not much opportunity for profit. Achieving the Dream received funding for its grants from a few charitable organizations, but it may need more to scale up the initiative after the pilot program ends. OpenStax also relies primarily on philanthropy, as well as partnerships with publishers who sell   services  —   such as quizzes and problem sets  —   on top of the free core content. Policymakers could help by providing additional funding. Yet it’s also up to schools to take advantage of the resources already available. By integrating   materials into their curriculums, colleges would make learning better and cheaper at the same time.

"Woman runs over $300,000 Ferrari in terrible attempt at leaving a parking spot.          Everyone has battled with parking at least once, but few have struggled this expensively. A woman driving a   convertible Saturday morning ran over a $300, 000 red Ferrari parked behind her. The collision occurred at Katie’s Cars & Coffee in Great Falls, Va. at a shopping center where car enthusiasts gather on Saturday mornings. A bystander captured the collision on video, which showed witnesses aghast and pointing at the incident as it unfolded. “That’s a big, big problem,” an onlooker is heard saying on video. In the video, the driver, with two children in the back seat, is seen just after she reversed into the Ferrari, her back tire on top of the car. She appears to unsuccessfully try to drive off the car, causing further damage. The Ferrari’s car alarm is ringing throughout the incident. When the driver gets out of the car and realizes the extent of what occurred, she appears shaken and says, “Oh, my God. ” A man approaches then appears on the video, saying, “Are you serious? That’s about the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. ” Fairfax County police say they were dispatched to the scene in the 9900 block of Georgetown Pike about 8 a. m. Saturday. No police report was filed and officers were on the scene for about 30 minutes, helping the two car owners exchange insurance information. Tawny Wright, a spokeswoman for the police department, said there was no further incident between the parties involved.  “I know it would have looked different if it was a Honda and a Honda,” Wright said. “There was nothing unusual for us. ” Read more: A look at the racial divide of Pokémon Go Have amateur fireworks shows gone too far?

"Detroit Public Schools will be completely broke by June. Here’s how things got to this point..  Teachers in Detroit are calling in sick en masse forcing the public school district to close nearly all of its campuses.      of Detroit Public Schools’ 97 schools closed Monday due to widespread ”sickouts,” teacher demonstrations involving calling in sick to protest the school district’s recent budgetary failures. Over the weekend the school district’s newly appointed manager Judge Steven Rhodes announced Detroit Public Schools would be unable to pay teacher salaries through the summer. Rhodes replaced one of Michigan’s most controversial emergency managers in March. This change in leadership was not surprising after months of these ”sickouts,” which teachers have used to protest everything from horrific school conditions to unsuitable pay. Rhodes faces a public school system crumbling in financial ruin and a community that doesn’t really want someone from the state in charge of fixing it.    Some of that has to do with the last guy in charge.    You may have heard of him: Darnell Earley, who earned national scrutiny for his role in the Flint water crisis, where he also served as emergency manager. The president of Detroit’s teachers union, Ivy Bailey, compared recent Detroit Public Schools closures to the   water in Flint. ”This is like the current situation in Flint, where the citizens’ concerns have been ignored,” she said in defense of the hundreds of teachers who have called in sick to protest hazardous conditions at local public schools.    Earley said he resigned because he fulfilled his goal of a ”comprehensive restructuring” ahead of his   schedule. Earley, DPS’s fourth emergency manager, was appointed in January 2015. But clearly teachers unions disagree that the situation is resolved satisfactorily. The Detroit Public Schools board has filed a class action lawsuit against Michigan’s governor and state officials over the terrible condition of the city’s public school district. Rhodes is not an emergency manager. His title is transition manager, and he says he aims to give full control of the district back to the community by August.    First, however, Rhodes says the Michigan state legislature must pass spending bills to keep the district afloat. Since Rhodes began as Detroit Public Schools’ transition manager, Michigan Gov. Rick Synder signed emergency spending legislation, which will carry Detroit Public Schools through June 30, but more help is needed, Rhodes has said repeatedly. ”This is not the time for lines in the sand,” Rhodes told WXYZ Detroit. ”The District has debt  —   over $500 million that it cannot pay while at the same time fulfilling its obligation to educate the kids.” What is happening in Detroit’s public schools? The conditions of Detroit Public Schools (DPS) have been declining for some time, and teachers are becoming increasingly fed up. DPS has been run by a   manager since 2009. In the past decade the district has suffered from massive enrollment losses and exceedingly low levels in student achievement (in one nationwide exam, Detroit students ranked last in performance of large city schools) and has incurred more than $500 million in operating debt. If the state and the district can’t sort out this problem by June 30, it will run out of money, and paychecks will stop going to teachers. Earley came to DPS to address the district’s massive debt, with plans to downsize DPS’s central office by nearly 100 jobs and make changes to benefits and contracts of teachers and staff. His changes are projected to save the district $10 million.    Last year Snyder also proposed splitting the Detroit district into two parts: a ”new” district, which would start   (and cost the state $715 million over 10 years) to manage the schools and enrollment, and the current district, which would exist only to pay off DPS’s debt. The proposal is still with the state’s legislature. Snyder appointed Earley with hopes he would be DPS’s last emergency manager. But with Earley’s resignation, Rhodes has been tasked with finishing reforms. But Detroit teachers and staff have been calling for the district’s return to local control since the beginning. ”Emergency managers can come and go, but the problems have stayed the same,” Keith Johnson, former president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, told the Detroit Free Press at the time of Earley’s appointment. When Earley took over, DPS had a $169. 5 million deficit. Today its deficit is more than $238 million, and the community says problems have only gotten worse. ”Rhodes has signaled support for local control and a willingness to listen to and work with educators, parents and the community,” Bailey said in a statement.    ”This is in contrast to the approach of past school leaders, which included filing lawsuits against educators, banning health inspectors from hazardous public school buildings, and racking up a school debt of a   dollars with no accountability.” But for anything to be done, Rhodes has been adamant that the state must pass a funding bill to rescue the district  —   and the clock is ticking. ”There is no Plan B,” he told WXYZ. Debt isn’t the only problem. The schools are actually falling apart. ”The odious smell of mold and mildew hits you like a brick wall when you step through the front doors at Spain   School in Detroit,” Lakia Wilson wrote for PBS Teachers’ Lounge in early January. Wilson, a school counselor, has worked at Spain   School for the past 19 years. For months, she and other teachers have been calling in sick in greater and greater numbers. Alongside hundreds of teachers and staff members, Wilson has contracted what many are calling the ”Snyder flu,” in reference to the governor, who they say is ignoring the needs of Detroit’s public schools. For the past six months, teachers in Detroit Public Schools have coordinated their sick leaves to protest unhealthy and unsafe work and learning environments. These ”sickouts” began last November, according to DPS spokesperson Chrystal Wilson. But in   more than 850 teacher absences forced the district to shut down 88 of Detroit’s 97 public school buildings, leaving the majority of the roughly 52, 000 enrolled students without a classroom. Wilson goes on to write:  ”The gym is closed because half of the floor is buckled and the other half suffered so much rainwater damage from the dripping ceiling that it became covered with toxic black mold. Instead of professionally addressing the problem, a black tarp simply was placed over the entire area like a  . That area of the school has been condemned. [. ..] The once beautiful pool sits empty because no one has come to fix it. The playground is   because a geyser of searing hot steam explodes out of the ground. [. ..] Exposed wires hang from missing ceiling tiles. Watermarks from leaks abound. Kids either sit in freezing classrooms with their coats on or strip off layers because of stifling heat. How can you teach or learn in conditions like these?”     ”The conditions in this school are inhuman, deplorable, dilapidated,” Wilson told Detroit WXYZ. ”It is not healthy. We are literally sick.” She gave a video tour of Spain Elementary’s conditions for the American Federation of Teachers:    Why did teachers call in sick instead of striking? There’s one simple reason Detroit’s teachers are calling in sick instead of organizing a strike: Michigan state law prohibits public school employees from striking, with a fine of $5, 000 per day to the state school aid fund. On the books, the recent school closures and teacher absences are sanctioned as sick leave. But punishing the teachers poses another problem for the state: If accused of illegally striking, each teacher has the right to a hearing. In the case of Detroit, that could mean up to 850 hearings. Republican state Sen. Phil Pavlov, who chairs the Michigan Senate Education Committee, is seeking a way to change the   laws to also encompass these ”sickouts.” His bill could strip teachers of their certification for striking and reduce funding to districts that do not deduct pay from striking teachers. ”These teachers deserve to be fired for turning their backs on the children in their care,” said Michigan state Rep. Kevin Cotter, a Republican from Mount Pleasant, told CNN. ”Their actions also go against any possible resolution on potential [Detroit Public Schools] reforms, because any   agreement on Detroit schools has to put the kids first.”    As of January 20, Cotter told CNN, more than 700, 000 instructional hours had been lost due to teachers’ protests. As sickouts start up again, Cotter says DPS’s nearly 46, 000 students have likely lost more than one million instructional hours. Detroit is already facing a teacher shortage and an unprecedented number of midyear resignations and retirements. According to reporting from the Detroit Free Press, last November the school district had more than 100 vacancies and had already assigned 115 substitutes to fill classrooms. Detroit Public Schools filed an injunction with the Michigan Court of Claims in an attempt to put an end to the weeks of mass sickouts in January. Their request was rejected. At the time, Detroit Federation of Teachers asked for teachers to return to the classroom for the sake of the children’s education. But now the union is calling for more sickouts in light of Rhodes’ budget announcement. This is supposed to be Detroit’s comeback President Barack Obama was in Detroit on January 20 speaking about the reemergence of the city’s auto industry. That same day, hundreds gathered to publicly protest conditions in both Flint and Detroit public schools. More than 90 percent of Detroit’s schools were forced to close due to a sickout that Wednesday. The ”comeback kid” narrative of Detroit is one Obama has pushed throughout his last term in office, touting his decision to follow through with George W. Bush’s $80 billion auto industry bailout in 2009 after one of the biggest industry crashes in recent history.    While the auto industry may be on the mend, the state of Detroit’s public schools shows the lasting impact of a city struggling to come back from bankruptcy. In the past 50 years nearly 1. 5 million people have left Detroit, mostly wealthy and white. The rapid decline in population shrank the city’s tax base, making it nearly impossible for Detroit to support public services and infrastructure built for a populous and booming economy. DPS has lost more than 100, 000 students in the past decade and has closed 150 schools. As it continues to borrow without settling past debts, it is possible DPS will have to close more schools in the coming years. As it is now, DPS will owe about $26 million every month this year just to pay off its debt, money that will not be invested in the district’s future or in fixing its crumbling infrastructure. For a true Detroit revival, fixing the public school system is an important step. ”Parents will not want to move their families into the city of Detroit unless there is a viable and effective and competitive school system here, so it’s absolutely critical to the future of the city of Detroit,” Rhodes said in his interview with WXYZ.

"New York Athletic Club’s secrets could be exposed in brawl lawsuit. The first rule of New York Athletic Club is don’t talk about New York Athletic Club. The storied Central Park South club  —   which counts billionaire businessman George Soros and former Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker as members  —   is invoking a very “Fight Club” tactic to shield itself in a lawsuit over an infamous 2012 brawl. The melee broke out during an   party hosted by the club’s Mercury Society for members under 45. An argument over a woman devolved into “instantaneous mayhem” according to a   deposition by victim Andrew Haesler who is suing the club for his injuries including a cracked eye socket. The Manhattan salesman is demanding a trove of documents from the club. He wants to know the identity of Mercury Society presidents for the three years prior to the fight. But the NYAC is resisting. “The club is private and its membership role is protected,” club lawyer Edward Fogarty Jr. says in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Haesler is also demanding minutes from board of governors meetings from 2011 to 2013. The club sniffs in response, “the court must be reminded that this is a private club with private financial information discussed at the board of governors meetings. ” Haesler’s attorney calls the excuse a smokescreen. “The implication is that, as a result of this status, NYAC should somehow be treated differently by the court,” attorney Robert Dooley says in a response filed this week. But, the Dooley argues, just like private business and organizations the NYAC is still “subject to the jurisdictions of New York Courts and laws. ” Reached by phone the club’s lawyer, Edward Fogarty Jr. said that the information Haesler is asking for has “nothing to do with” his case.",1.0
"St. Louis Archbishop denounces Girl Scouts for supporting transgender rights. Catholics should think twice before indulging in a box of Thin Mints, according to the St. Louis archbishop, who said the church disagrees strongly with some of the Girl Scouts’ values. followers and scout leaders, Archbishop Robert Carlson said the behavior and views of one of America’s oldest, secular youth organizations run at odds with the teachings of the Catholic church  —   in particular, the Girl Scouts’ support for transgender rights and homosexuality.  “Girl Scouts is exhibiting a troubling pattern of behavior and it is clear to me that as they move in the ways of the world it is becoming increasingly incompatible with our Catholic values,” Carlson’s letter read in part.  “While Catholics are called to treat all people with compassion and mercy, we must at the same time be mindful of whom we allow to teach and form our youth and the messages they present,” he wrote in the letter dated Feb. 18. Carlson also voiced his opposition   on the archdiocese’s website, pointing to a number of concerns he had over the Girl Scouts’ actions. He claimed, for instance, that the organization recently refused a gift of $100, 000 that was pledged with the stipulation that it “wouldn’t support transgender girls. ” “Since the funds were designated this way, Girl Scouts declined the gift and instead used the national media attention to raise over $300, 000 with the tagline that Girl Scouts is ‘for every girl,’” the website said. The archdiocese also said troops in Utah have recently been formed exclusively to reach out to transgendered youth and that the Girl Scouts celebrated the historic Supreme Court ruling on   marriage on its Instagram and Twitter accounts. In voicing his opposition, Carlson called for pastors who allow troops to meet on parish property “to conduct a meeting with troop leadership to review these concerns and discuss implementing alternative options for the formation of our girls. ” He also disbanded the Catholic Committee on Girl Scouts and instead formed a Catholic Committee for Girls Formation that will “be charged with ministry to all girls in various organizations. ” The St. Louis Archdiocese also addressed the celebrated Girl Scout cookies. Its website included a    section, advising Catholics on how to confront the differences between the church and the scouts.  “Can I still buy Girl Scout Cookies?” reads one section. “Each person must act in accord with their conscience,” the archdiocese said. “Here are a few things to consider when making your decision: There is a licensing fee attached to each box of Girl Scout cookies produced, paid to GSUSA. ” Licensing fees paid to Girl Scouts of America on all trademarked Girl Scout items (cookies, Girl Scout curriculum books and badges, ice creams, coffee creamers, etc.) amounts to millions of dollars every year, according to the archdiocese, which claims on average only 10 to 20 percent of the total cookie revenue remains with the troop selling the cookies. Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri serves over 43, 000 girls with the support of over 15, 000 adult volunteers in the City of St. Louis and 28 surrounding counties in eastern Missouri.  The organization responded to Carlson, saying in a statement, “Although Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri has enjoyed a history of cooperation with the Archdiocese of St. Louis for almost 100 years, over the past several years, you may have become aware of issues expressed by the Archdiocese of St. Louis regarding Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).  “Although we are a secular organization, we greatly value our   partnerships with religious organizations across many faiths,” said Bonnie Barczykowski, Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri CEO. “I am grateful for what you do each and every day as parents and leaders of these young women. I am here to support you and your girls. We are honored that you choose Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri,” she said, ",1.0

She was unable to prove it. She used the fact that she was Native American to advance her career. Elizabeth Warren is a total fraud. I know it.

As a professor at Harvard, she boasted of her supposed heritage, and the university touted the claim to highlight the diversity of its faculty.

"This scientific quest to find “missing” memories is changing the way we think about the brain.  Neuroscientist Nathan Rose and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin recently lost track of a memory.     I mean that literally. One minute, they saw a trace of a memory “light up” in an fMRI scan. In the next minute it was gone. And in this one simple observation, Rose and his colleagues are challenging a   scientific belief about how the brain works. And can open to door to new understanding of why we remember, and why we forget. The curious case of the “missing” memory Rose lost the memory during a fairly simple experiment. Participants were brought into the lab and given an image of a face and a separate name to memorize. They were told they’d later be tested on their ability to recognize that name and that face. All the while, a fMRI scanner was peering into their brains. An artificial intelligence program then used the fMRI images to distinguish between when the participants were thinking about the face, and when they were thinking about the name. When participants were asked to recall either the face or the name, the computer program could “see” them thinking about each.     But then the participants underwent a different test. And this is where things get weird.     The participants were told that they were only going to be tested on their memory of the face and didn’t need to remember the name. When that happened, it was like a switch turned off in the participants’ brains. The fMRI could no longer “see” the memory of the name. It was “as if the item has been forgotten,” Rose says.  Except here’s the really surprising part: The name wasn’t actually forgotten. The participants could still remember it later on when prompted again. The memory was still there  —   there was just no observable trace of it in the brain.     This may sound like a minor observation, but it could fundamentally change the way neuroscientists think about how the brain works. The study, published today in Science, shows there’s a whole “dark” brain activity that neuroscientists can’t see with current neuroimaging technology. And if scientists can better understand this dark network of memories, perhaps they can find ways to make us retain more information, or retrieve lost memories.  The conventional wisdom on working memory may be wrong            Working memory is the function of our brain that holds information that we need immediately  —   if someone tells you the names of the hosts before you walk into a party, that’s where you keep them. Think of it like the desktop on your computer. It’s where you bring   memories out of deep storage to work on them. It’s also where new information is first stored in your brain before it can be filed away. Working memory is the space where we work on our thoughts and put them to use. For a long time, neuroscientists thought they knew how working memory works. Based on neuroimaging studies, it seemed that working memory was always associated with a flurry of neural activity.     “The inference, then, was that a   memory existed only if it produced some sustained brain activity that could be identified with our various forms of neuroscience measurement methods  —   including functional neuroimaging such as fMRI,” Jarrod   a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Austin, explains. If there is no trace of a thought in a brain scan, it implies the thought is no longer there. Or that fMRIs  —   which are key tool of neuroscience research  —   don’t tell us all that much about the working of the brain.  What Rose’s new study suggests is that the memory is still there in the absence of any observable neural activity. “[It’s] a big deal because people assumed elevated activity is how [working] memories are stored,” Bradley Postle, a study   says. (And it’s not the case that the memories were simply transferred to   storage.) “This line of research is a big deal,” Nelson Cowan, a psychologist who studies memory at the University of Missouri Columbia who was not involved in this study, tells me. “This kind of work could be helpful in diagnosing what’s going on when a person cannot remember something you just presented to them. ” Because there’s a huge difference in treatment approaches for a patient who does not have the memory stored somewhere in her brain, and a patient who does have that memory stored somewhere, perhaps silently, but just cannot call it to attention.  It’s also a big deal because of what Rose and his colleagues did next. They brought that silent memory back to life with a zap of magnetic radiation.  The memories can be temporarily restored  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuroscience tool that sends pulses of magnetic radiation to temporarily “turn on” or “turn off” a person’s neural circuits. “For example, if find your thumb area in your left motor cortex, and if I [turn on TMS] I can cause your thumb to twitch,” Rose says. Guided by machine learning, Rose’s team was able to train the TMS to locate areas of the brain where participants were storing the memory of the face or the name. Simply put, Rose and his colleagues devised a way to turn back on the memory that had grown silent.     When they turned on the TMS on the silent memory, an EEG brain scan showed activation in the area of the brain associated with that memory. So they ran the memory trial again, zapping people with TMS when a memory became silent. When the TMS was on, it seemed like the participants became confused about which item  —   the face or the name  —   they were supposed to remember, and they performed worse on the test. Some of Rose’s colleagues jokingly called it the “Frankenstein effect,” suggesting they brought this memory back to life.  What’s more, Rose and his colleagues found evidence that these “silent” memories also get silently “deleted” when person is told they no longer need the information.  So, to use the computer analogy again, it’s like these working memories, as with a computer, can either be brought out of recycling or they can be deleted when no longer needed. And this whole process happens beyond the detections of typical neuroscience research tools. It’s a part of the brain’s “operating system” that we’ve never seen before. As for the ability of TMS to reactivate forgotten memories in patients, Rose says that’s still a   idea. “It’s going to be hard to avoid having the [study] spinned as ‘TMS can bring your memories back,’ which is going far beyond what we’re showing,” he says. It’s better to think of the TMS more as sonar, pinging the brain to see if the memory is even in there. Where do the silent memories go?            One theory is that the brain is constantly and silently reorganizing its neural networks to hold the impression of these memories, but keeps them inactive. That’s roughly how neuroscience thinks   memory storage works. But these results are making Rose wonder if that’s how many systems of the brain work: that they are constantly moving thoughts from “active” states to “silent” states, possibly by reorganizing the connections in the brain.     Christos Constantinidis, a neuroscience researcher at Wake Forrest University, says Rose’s results don’t negate the importance of neural firing in working memory, but that they suggest the neural firing and this “silent” process work together to make the brain more efficient. “There are some instances where [sustained activity] may not be enough or may not be efficient,” he says. “This silent mechanism bridges the gap. ” There’s also an alternative explanation for what happens: The brain still is firing neurons to sustain the memory, but they are too few in number for brain scans to detect. (There can be hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel, the smallest unit of brain activity a fMRI can detect).  Overall, this new study is a reminder neuroscience is just starting to understand the brain, and it’s a recognition that the typical tools of neuroscience  —   fMRI, EEG, all of the tools that depend on electrical signals or blood flow  —   just can’t see many of the brain’s processes. And that means we’re just scratching the surface in terms of our observations about the brain. It’s still mostly a black box.  “Just showing one part of the brain ‘light up’ and inferring that’s where the item [memory] is  —   that’s a rudimentary idea,” Rose says.  “The brain is the most complicated object that we know of in the universe,” Postle says. We’re going to have to be cleverer in our methods if we ever want to fully understand it.  ",-1.0
"Barclays tightens email security after prankster fools its CEO.

Staley   earlier this month over his controversial attempts to unmask a whistleblower, but Barclays Chairman John McFarlane came to his defense, comparing the incident to a minor traffic violation. Hours after that meeting, which Staley survived with his job, Staley got suckered by an email that was purportedly from McFarlane, telling Staley, “You owe me a large scotch. ” Staley responded to the hoaxster’s email, which came from the Gmail account john. mcfarlane. barclays@gmail. com, with a profusion of thanks, telling him after several exchanges, “Thanks for sharing the foxhole. ” To prevent another embarrassment like that, Barclays “has decided to activate a warning message whenever an employee sends a message to an external email address on a mobile device, which previously only happened on desktop computers,”   which cited unnamed sources. Barclays declined to comment on the move. The email prankster  —   who, it turns out, was a disgruntled Barclays shareholder  —   told the FT he took advantage of the fact that most email systems don’t show a sender’s full email address unless the recipient clicks on the sender’s name. The prankster added that he usually wrote “sent from iPhone” at the bottom of his emails to avoid having to mimic the wordy legal disclosures that accompany most corporate emails. “If you try to be too clever or it’s too spurious or forced it will more than likely get rumbled,” the prankster told the FT, asking not to be named. “Keep it short to begin with and ideally reference something that will ring true.

[AP   Hillel Italie]     The New Yorker, for its part, maintains that since Talese mentioned some discrepancies in the motel owner’s account, the reader should know it was unreliable: caveat lector. And besides, said editor David Remnick, ”This is not an account of, say, national security.” [Washington Post   Erik Wemple]     For some, the saga is some   schadenfreude because of Talese’s behavior at a forum earlier this year, when he made racist comments to a New York Times Magazine reporter and said he didn’t know of any inspiring woman writers.

"The Clintons and the press are caught in a pointless, toxic cycle of scandal.  In retrospect, it seems almost too perfect that the most notable scandal of the Obama administration, the one that necessitated a public statement from the director of the FBI, was about Hillary Clinton rather than Barack Obama. Or maybe it was one of two somewhat notable scandals, along with Benghazi  —   another case where the scrutiny on Clinton was far greater than on the actual president.    It makes sense because the Clintons have, since even before Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 1992, been magnets for scandal, many of them   nothings. When their close friend killed himself, they were accused of murder. When they lost money on a bad real estate deal that a friend who turned out to be a con artist suckered them into, it triggered a federal investigation, culminating in Clinton’s impeachment for completely unrelated conduct. When they tried to clean up a White House office that the FBI was investigating for financial improprieties, the independent counsel wound up looking into their actions. So of course when Clinton joined Obama’s administration, similar   would follow. But it also makes sense because Obama has been almost entirely immune to this kind of imbroglio. The 2008 presidential campaign made him defend his past contact with Weather Underground militant Bill Ayers, his ties to   Chicago developer Tony Rezko, and his attendance at Jeremiah Wright’s fiery,   conspiracy theory —  touting sermons at Trinity Church. But none of those stuck. The Wright incident instead led to the best speech of Obama’s career, arguably helping him secure the Democratic nomination. None of these scandals have carried into his administration at all. What few scandals there have been have either involved people far enough down the federal government org chart such that Obama was barely implicated (”Fast & Furious,” the IRS scandal, the VA scandal) or were so transparently ridiculous that they didn’t hurt Obama at all (the ”birther” conspiracy theories being the canonical example).    So while Clinton faced the typical barrage of attacks while in the Obama administration, Obama himself is emerging from his eight years in office entirely untainted by scandal, to a degree matched by few presidents in history.    One way to read this is that Obama is unusually clean and the Clintons usually sketchy in their dealings. Another is that the Clintons were targets of an unusually intense smear campaign. The reality is a mix: The Clintons really were unfairly targeted in the early 1990s, but the experience has left them sufficiently jaded and paranoid that they think their own conduct is irrelevant to whether they’ll be targeted. That leads to carelessness, which in turn leads to more scandals, and on and on the cycle goes. Why is Clinton so   and Obama so  ?             There are two ways to interpret the discrepancy between the Clintons’ propensity for attracting scandals and Obama’s seeming immunity to them. One, which you’ll hear Clinton loyalists voice, is that there’s a double standard, that the Clintons get battered for offenses that would barely raise an eyebrow coming from any other politician, including Obama. On that interpretation, the email scandal was just another example of how the Clintons just can’t catch a break. Even when there’s a totally different Democrat in the White House, the guns are still trained on them.    The other interpretation, which you’ll hear Obama loyalists voice, is that the Clintons provoke more scandals because they do more fishy stuff. ”Fishy” here doesn’t mean ”criminal” or even ”unethical.” No one in the Obama camp, to my knowledge, actually thinks that Clinton used an offsite email service as part of some nefarious scheme to keep records from the public. But they do think it’s really dumb to do anything that might be misconstrued by congressional Republicans as malfeasance and spark an investigation, especially when that thing you’re doing is completely unnecessary. ”No Drama” Obama doesn’t do stuff like give paid speeches at Goldman Sachs or chat up the head of the Justice Department when his wife is being investigated or keep around personally loyal aides who nonetheless provoke unnecessary   (like Philippe Reines or Sidney Blumenthal). He doesn’t do it not because he thinks it’s wrong but because it’s imprudent; it gets in the way and makes it harder to get stuff done. So while Obama loyalists absolutely do not think that Clinton should be indicted or that she did anything wrong regarding Benghazi, you will sometimes hear them lament that the Clintons sometimes bring this stuff on themselves.    The trouble with the Clinton loyalists’ theory is that it encourages a fatalism about the war on the Clintons that causes complacency, and spurs the Clintons to do stuff that really does bring more criticism and scrutiny upon them than they’d endure if they were as careful as Obama has been. To hear the Clintons tell it, conservative   animus is a force of   scale and gravity. In 2004, Bill Clinton gave a speech following a screening of The Hunting of the President, a   documentary adapted from the book of the same name (subtitle: ”The   Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton”).  Both the book and film contend that Hillary Clinton’s   assertion that there was a vast   conspiracy out to get her and Bill was literally true; that there really was a concerted effort from funders like Richard Mellon Scaife, outlets like the American Spectator, congressional Republicans, and the independent counsel’s office to take down the Clintons on   phony charges. In his speech, Clinton explains his scandals as the inevitable consequence of  ’60s backlash to social liberalism, and as a natural byproduct of the end of the Cold War. ”When the Berlin Wall fell, the perpetual right in America, which always needs an enemy, didn’t have an enemy anymore,” Clinton argues. ”So I had to serve as the next best thing. I think it’s really important that you understand that.” If you believe you are being targeted with the same intensity as the Soviet Union, then the question of how you can change your behavior starts to feel like so much fiddling around the margins. Reporters who’ve spent time with Hillary Clinton find that she’s absorbed this view, that she and Bill feel they can’t catch a break with the press, and so she isn’t too concerned about taking actions that could exacerbate the problem.    ”It’s clear that even today she and her campaign feel that they can’t win with the press, that the story lines about her are already written,” Rebecca Traister wrote in a New York magazine profile of Hillary Clinton in May. ”It’s a paranoiac cycle  —   Clinton and her team think that everyone is after her, and their behavior creates further incentive for everyone to come after her.” The Clintons’ targeting really is unusual             From the vantage point of 2016, the Clintons’ theory of their own persecution can seem   and almost pathologically distanced from their own actions. Even if you think the impeachment was an idiotic waste of the country’s time and resources, it remains the case that Bill Clinton never would’ve been impeached if he hadn’t slept with an intern and lied about it under oath. He didn’t have to do that. The same, to a much lesser extent, with Hillary and the email server. The scandal is overblown, it’s true, but she still could’ve avoided all this hassle and drama if she’d just used her official email account for all State Department business. But for the Clintons, everything from 1992 onward is part of the same ongoing saga, and it began way before they did anything particularly fishy at all. Bill slept with Gennifer Flowers? Not great, but a normal, survivable sex scandal. Whitewater? The Clintons did literally nothing wrong; it was all made up nonsense. Travelgate?   nonsense. Vince Foster?   nonsense. There was even a scandal about a haircut Bill Clinton got in 1993. ”You will never hear me criticize or complain about the press coverage I got in the aftermath of all the stuff that happened in ’98 with my deposition in the Jones case,” he says in the Hunting of the President speech, alluding to the Lewinsky scandal. ”I’m talking about what happened before.” And what happened before is tough to explain in terms of the Clintons’ actions. Obama’s relationship with Tony Rezko is more suspicious than the Clintons’ role in Whitewater, yet it did not result in any federal investigation of Obama. That’s a real discrepancy, one that has to be explained through historical context, through the unique status the Clintons have, and through the uniquely intense campaign to build up scandals relating to them. Bill Clinton is probably right that the Cold War made politics less   which, combined with the existence of the   independent counsel’s office, set the stage for a presidency constantly under investigation.    There’s also something to be said for the Clintons’ DGAF attitude toward their scandals. One of the major failures of the Obama presidency was its hypercautious approach to appointments, requiring intense vetting that left key administration and judicial positions unfilled for too long. That was a direct result of his administration’s caution when it came to potential scandals, a caution the Clintons are willing to throw to the wind. The Clintons’ peculiar relationship with scandal did not begin with them being unusually sketchy characters. They weren’t; they had flaws, but Bill Clinton in 1993 was no dirtier than Barack Obama in 2009. He was painted as much dirtier, though, and he and Hillary responded by adopting an assumption that the press would target them no matter what, and so a   secrecy,   and fatalism took hold. The result is a mutually reinforcing cycle, in which the particular historical circumstances of the 1990s created the image of the   Clintons, and the Clintons gave up on trying to erase that image, ensuring its perpetuation long after it should’ve faded away. Politics is not set up to create presidencies like Bill Clinton’s anymore, but the Clintons themselves are not set up to reap the benefits of that shift.

"Hack Brief: Beware the Spammy Pokemon Go Apps Being Pushed to Millions of iPhones. There comes a time in everyone's life when they consider, for better or for worse, downloading Pokémon Go. Now it seems scammers are ready for that impulsive moment to arrive, and they're just waiting to redirect unsuspecting players to an app store where they may catch more than Pikachus. New research from the security firm Trend Micro indicates that bogus third-party stores—a long-running problem for Android—have now been surprisingly successful in targeting iPhone users, tricking them into installing ad-laced impostor apps on their devices. TrendMicro highlights two third-party app services: Haima, which is based in China, and the Vietnam-based HiStore. Both have achieved millions of downloads of their counterfeit Pokémon Go apps for iOS (an impressive and concerning 10 million in the case of HiStore) as well as other fake versions of popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Haima's fake Minecraft app, by Trend Micro's count, has been downloaded more than 68 million times. The companies promote their phony apps heavily on social media, luring people into clicking on them instead of searching in Apple's App Store. And it's working. ",0.0

"Use Code to Create Sweet 3-D Visualizations of Electric Fields. 

Slide:  1 / of  1.

Getty Images  I’ve already made the argument that numerical models (using computer code) should be an integral part of the introductory physics course. But what if you don’t know where to start? Suppose you are either in or teaching the second semester of introductory physics. What do you need to get started? I’m here to help you with that. First, a couple of notes about numerical calculations with VPython. Now for some physics. Let’s start with the electric field due to a point charge. If I have some charge, q then the electric field will be pointed radially outward (for a positive charge) and decrease in strength as you get farther away from the charge. This can be written as the vector equation:  Let’s just jump right into a calculation. Suppose I have a 3 nC charge at the location <0.1, -0.2, 0> m. What is the electric field at a location <-0.4, 0.2, 0.1> m? Normally, I would make a sketch to show you what’s going on. However, in this case I am going to make a program. Here is what this looks like. The red sphere is the charge and the small white sphere is the location of the calculated electric field. Although I added comments in the code, let me add some notes along with some things you should try. If you don’t understand any part of the code—change it. Don’t worry, you can’t really mess anything up. If you change the code and can’t get it back to working order just reset it. Let’s do another example. Here I want to do something very similar to the problem above. In fact, let’s use the same charge at the same location with the same observation location. However, I want to add a second electric charge with a value of of 2 nC at a location of <0.2, 0.1, 0> m. Here is the output of the code that calculates the total electric field. Notice that I am no longer displaying the position vectors—I don’t think those are necessary.  Now it is your turn to make this same calculation. Here is some starting code. It doesn’t work right now, but if you add some stuff you should be able to get it to make the same output as above.  Remember, you can’t break anything. If you get stuck, go back to the program with just one point charge. Once you get it working with the same values as my example, you can try changing the location of point charges or the location of the observation. A dipole is just two electric charges (of value +q and –q) separated by some distance (s). So, the net charge on a dipole is zero Coulombs but since the two charges are separated there is still an electric field created by the pair. It turns out that these electric dipoles pop up in lots of cases (or at least many things can be approximated as a dipole). When you have two electric charges, you can find the total electric field at some point in the normal manner of adding the contributions due to the two charges. However, we can also find an approximate value for the magnitude of the electric field due to a dipole as long as we are looking at the field along the axis of the dipole or perpendicular to the axis. I will leave the derivations of these to you (or you can watch this video). But here are expressions for the field perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the dipole.  In these equations, r is the distance from the center of the dipole to the point where you want to find the electric field. Also, this is just an approximation for the case where r is much greater than s. Enough about dipoles. Let’s calculate the electric field due to a dipole. Check out this program.  Now you can play with the code. Here are some things to try. That’s it. You have now used python to calculate electric fields. This is just the first step to doing some really cool stuff.",0.0

Seconds after shooting the man he had just pulled over, the police officer yelled at a woman in the passenger seat:  Ma am, keep your hands where they are. ? Diamond  Lavish ? Reynolds watched blood drench her boyfriend s white shirt. She did not scream. She did not cry. Her language remained polite.  I will, sir, ? she replied calmly.  No worries. I will. ? Reynolds recorded the conversation on her phone,   a routine traffic stop that turned deadly and caught the world s attention. AsÂ the officer shouted expletives, she continued to narrate with startling composure.  He just shot his arm off, ? Reynolds    explained to viewers.

Many viewers wonderedÂ how Reynolds maintained such aÂ calm demeanor. Was it psychological shock or the   behaviorÂ of a black woman who fearedÂ law enforcement? Speaking to reporters Thursday, ReynoldsÂ saidÂ she found strength forÂ her    daughter, who also witnessed the shooting from the backseat.

"Please shut up about your ‘10 bands’. I usually don’t do this sort of thing, but, gosh, everybody is doing it  —   that cute bartender I’m into, my English History Since 1688 professor, my   my pastor (we’re estranged, but, like, you can’t   your pastor). And in 2017, if everybody is doing it, that means I have to do it, too. They’ll be absolutely outraged if I don’t. OK, here it goes: I hate 10 of these social media trends. One is a lie: 1. That stupid “10 bands” list My Facebook news feed has suddenly morphed from a pictorial of braggadocio, political   and vacuous amusement into a text dump of braggadocio, political   and vacuous amusement  —   all thanks to the evil “10 bands” list. The trend is an irksome new Facebook game  —   sans fun or challenge  —   wherein a user lists nine concerts he’s been to, plus one that he hasn’t. It’s your job to guess which one is the odd gig out. And here I thought “The Handmaid’s Tale” was a dystopian nightmare!  has an internet obsession proved so empty, boring and obnoxious. Even   checks only two of those boxes.  Why the slavish devotion to these mindless trends? As Eric Hoffer wrote in his 1951 classic, “The True Believer”  —   a book that, admittedly, centers on much more consequential mass movements than the Harlem Shake  —   “There is perhaps no more reliable indicator of a society’s ripeness for a mass movement than the prevalence of unrelieved boredom. In almost all the . . . periods preceding the rise of mass movements, there is reference to vast ennui. ” That’s probably why everybody and their Auntie Flora seems to be posting these abominations during the late afternoon (at work) at 5 p. m. (on the train) and 2 a. m. (in bed)  —   at peak idle times. Then, for some users, the list is a perfect chance to blare some musical arrogance. “Let’s play a game! Who didn’t I see? Jimi Hendrix, Queen, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Fleetwood Mac, Elvis, The Wonders, The Eagles, Michael Jackson or Selena. (Duh! The Wonders. They’re not a real band! )” The big boasters are, to my mind, more egregious than the bored posters. The Pitchfork set, bragging about their   résumés, are so clouded by smugness that they fail to realize nobody gives a damn. So what? In 1977 you had a free Friday night and paid $20 to see Queen? Let’s talk when you share your candid backstage photo with Freddie Mercury. Thankfully, after 48 torturous hours, the “10 Bands” trend is breathing its last intolerable breaths. I know this because Facebook users are beginning to satirize it  —   a death knell even more cloying than the lists themselves.",1.0
"Special Counsel Robert Mueller Should Clarify Trump's Russia Ties. Rarely do political happenings solicit praise from both senator Chuck Schumer and denizens of far-right Twitter like Bill Mitchell. But the Department of Justice's appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia did just that.

For liberals with impeachment fever dreams, it felt like a step toward justice. For conservatives in Trump's corner, it represents a shot at the ultimate vindication.

"‘I appeal to all the parents in India not to send their children’ to the U.S., distraught father says after shooting.      NEW DELHI  —   Family members of the Indian men shot at an Olathe, Kan. bar Wednesday in a possible hate crime said they feared that an atmosphere of fear and xenophobia in the United States means the country is not a safe place for Indians, with one Indian father exhorting parents not to send their children there. “There is a kind of hysteria spreading that is not good because so many of our beloved children live there,” said Venu Madhav, a relative of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the young software engineer fatally shot Wednesday night. “Such hatred is not good for people. ” Kuchibhotla and his friend and colleague Alok Madasani, 32, were at a bar crowded with patrons watching a basketball game Wednesday, witnesses said, when an allegedly drunken man began hurling racial slurs at them and then opened fire, reportedly shouting, “Get out of my country!”   [He yelled ‘Get out of my country,’ witnesses say, and then shot 2 men from India, killing one]   Kuchibhotla, 32, was seriously wounded in the attack and died later at a hospital. Madasani and a third victim  —   Ian Grillot, who had tried to intervene  —   were treated for shotgun wounds at a hospital.      Ian Grillot was shot in the hand and chest at a restaurant in Olathe, Kan. after trying to subdue a man who opened fire on two other diners. One of them, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, later died from his wounds. ( )   Adam W. Purinton, 51, of Olathe, a Navy veteran, was later arrested and charged with   murder and attempted   murder. Federal law enforcement officials said Thursday that they and local police are investigating to determine whether the shootings were “bias motivated. ” Witnesses said Purinton seemed to be under the impression that the men were of Middle Eastern descent. Family members of the victims living in the southern city of Hyderabad told the Hindustan Times that the two friends  —   software engineers with the   Garmin  —   had not antagonized Purinton, and that Purinton had “picked an argument” with the men, suggesting that they were staying in the United States illegally. “They tried to tell him that they had done their [master’s degrees] in Kansas in 2006 and had been staying there with valid work permits,” a relative said. Kuchibhotla and Madasani were employees on the Aviation Systems Engineering team at Garmin. According to Kuchibhotla’s LinkedIn account, he held a master’s degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso and a bachelor’s degree from the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University in India. Madasani’s LinkedIn said he studied at the University of   City and at Vasavi College of Engineering in India. Madasani’s father, Jaganmohan Reddy, told the Hindustan Times that in recent months, he had begun to ask his son to return home, fearing that he might not be safe in the country’s racially charged atmosphere, with ugly incidents and hate groups on the rise.    Jagan Mohan Reddy holds up a smartphone with an image of his son, Alok Madasani, at his residence in Hyderabad on Feb. 24. (Noah    Images)  “The situation seems to be pretty bad after Trump took over as the U. S. president. I appeal to all the parents in India not to send their children to the United States in the present circumstances,” Reddy said. Madhav told The Post in an interview that Kuchibhotla’s family was in shock, and that it was the third such possible hate crime in recent weeks that has affected members of the   Southern Indian community in the United States. “Something has changed in the United States,” he said. “Such things are not good for the Indian community living here. ” In India, the minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, said she was “shocked” by the attack and “rushed” two diplomats to Kansas from the Indian Consulate in Houston. Meanwhile, cable news channels debated whether the United States was now a danger zone for those with brown skin. “Is this the new normal?” an anchor on NDTV news channel wondered.
