"Battle brewing for DNC leadership. Washington (CNN) A new storm is brewing inside the Democratic Party as competing factions begin to grapple for its leadership as the party reels in the wake of Donald Trump’s stunning victory. The emerging favorite to fill the job, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, made formal his candidacy for the chairmanship on Monday, saying the party must ”begin the rebuilding process now.” In what might be perceived as a jab at the broader Democratic strategy in 2016, he said the party ”did not motivate enough people to the ballot box” in the past election and, given the Democrats’ struggles up and down the ballot, that he would seek to ”build a bench not just for federal candidates, but for state and local candidates across the nation.” Ellison, the first black Muslim elected to Congress, enters the contest with the backing from across the left. He’s won endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the fiery independent and former Democratic primary candidate, along with outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is set to replace Reid in 2017, all pledging their support. But other politicos have expressed interest in the position.  Howard Dean, who ran the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, and announced last week he would again seek its top role, and is expected to be among Ellison’s most formidable challengers.  Another former presidential candidate, Martin O’Malley, has also announced that he is throwing his hat in the ring. ”Since the election, I have been approached by many Democrats who believe our party needs new leadership,” said the former Maryland Governor. ”I’m taking a hard look at DNC Chair because I know how badly we need to reform our nominating process, articulate a bold progressive vision, recommit ourselves to higher wages and a stronger middle class, and return to our roots as a nationwide, grassroots party.” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman and DNC Vice Chair Ray Buckley is exploring a run, according to the Boston Globe. ”. @ChairmanBuckley on DNC chair, not officially running yet, but ”I am definitely being strongly encouraged to consider it by DNC members,” reporter James Pindell tweeted. In an interview with CNN affiliate NH1, Buckley said he had received a number of calls and emails from people ”all over the country” encouraging him to run.  ”In the last few days there have been a lot of people calling in from all over the country, either emailing me or picking up the phone, that have expressed great interest in being able to essentially flip the DNC upside down and restructure how it operates, how it works making it much more grassroots friendly organization and less of a top to bottom organization,” Buckley said.  And Labor Secretary Tom Perez, an outspoken surrogate of Hillary Clinton, is eyeing a run, according to Democrats with knowledge of his plans. A number of Democrats    especially those interested in someone who can rally the party together after Tuesday’s crushing loss    are floating his name and Perez is said to be receptive, according to people close to him. One upside to Perez, according to people close to him, is that he has limited experience in elected office, something a number of DNC members have raised as red flags for other contenders. Sanders backing Ellison, But Sanders    a registered independent who caucuses with Democrats and fought a lengthy primary battle for the party’s nomination this year    and top allies are touting Ellison for the job. The Minnesota congressman currently   the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In an email to supporters late Thursday, the Vermont senator said Ellison was uniquely qualified to take on ”the political establishment and billionaire class,” and that ”his experience and perspective would be key to leading the fight against Trump.” Sanders also made the case for the institutional value of the DNC, an organization he and his backers clashed with repeatedly during the primaries. ”I’m sure a lot of you have some feelings about the Democratic National Committee,” he said. ”The truth is that it is an important entity to build, support, and maintain if we are to have the chance to organize and win in the coming elections while Trump is president.” Ellison supported Sanders in the primary, but emerged as a vocal Clinton supporter after she clinched the nomination. Sanders named Ellison to the Democratic convention’s platform drafting committee this summer, filling an influential slot given to the Vermont senator as a concession from the party after an unexpectedly tense nominating contest.  On Sunday Ellison also won the backing from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who is retiring from Congress after the turn of the year.  ”My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,” Reid said in a statement. ”Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.” Ellison’s office refused to comment to CNN on the record, but he said on a Democracy For America call late Thursday that he would make an announcement about his intentions on Monday.  Dean eyes return, A former governor of Vermont, Dean served as head of the DNC following his own insurgent, though ultimately unsuccessful bid for the party’s 2004 nomination. As part of his leadership, Dean championed a ”  strategy,” a plan intended to broaden the electoral map for Democrats. ”The dems need organization and focus on the young,” Dean tweeted on Thursday, proposing to renew the strategy. ”Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.” On Friday, Dean stepped down from his special adviser role at Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee he founded in 2004. But Dean, despite his considerable ties to the more liberal wing of the party, looks to be in for a struggle against a progressive left emboldened by Sanders’ primary bid. On Thursday night, People for Bernie, a   progressive group with ties to Sanders, told CNN it was backing Ellison as a first step in displacing Clinton loyalists with ”a leadership untainted by cozy relationships to Wall St. moneymen, corporate behemoths, dictators, or monarchs.” In a jab at Dean, People for Bernie   Charles Lenchner added, ”Any   strategy must begin with a   accountability project we reject any effort to unite the party behind the agents of a failed leadership.” The current head of the DNC is Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative and former CNN contributor, who is leading in an interim capacity after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on the eve of the convention. Hacked emails appeared to show Wasserman Schultz and other   DNC officials discussing ways to undermine Sanders’ effort to oust Clinton in the primary. Brazile has come under increasing scrutiny after another trove of hacked emails showed her forwarding questions from a town hall jointly hosted by CNN to the Clinton campaign. ",-1.0
"Review: Timber Timbre, ’Sincerely, Future Pollution’. Note: NPR’s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page. When Taylor Kirk and his bandmates in Timber Timbre set out for France a year ago to record their newest record, Sincerely, Future Pollution, they envisioned a sound you could dance to, that was worthy of celebration. For more than a decade, the   band  —   led by Kirk, who handles much of the writing and recording  —   has explored the gnarled and shadowy corners of rock, evolving from   cabin beams (Timber Timbre) to ’70s country twang (Hot Dreams). None of it has exactly been the stuff that gets one shaking, outside of a narcotized sway in the corner of a plywood bar. Sincerely, Future Pollution isn’t, either. But maybe it’s not the time to dance. ”I had the idea that we could do something that was fun. Which . .. we can’t,” laughed Kirk in a measured whisper from a phone in his rehearsal space in eastern Montreal. Instead, Sincerely, Future Pollution is another window into Kirk’s sweetly darkened sensibility, this time filtered through holistic collaborations with Timber Timbre’s supporting cast, keyboardist Mathieu Charbonneau and   Simon Trottier. Along for the ride are a wealth of prototypical electronics the trio found in that French studio where they recorded their sixth album. ”We were using a palette that I didn’t feel was ours,” said Kirk. Those unfamiliar instruments lend the album a patina of Reaganism, a vintage sound that feels all too relevant these days. Sincerely, Future Pollution deals with that unease most directly on ”Western Questions,” which opens with a sweeping guitar melody before sinking into a burlesque swoon. Kirk exhales: ”International witness protection   Through mass migration   The imminent surrender of land. Tucked in safety   At the counter of a luxury liner   With a noose in my hand.” It’s evocative of urban failure and our modern dilemma of slick disbelief. It ends, improbably, with a celebratory drum bridge worthy of Phil Collins and a guitar hook as indelible and catchy as Hall  Oates could hope for. ”Moment” might be the most beautiful and affecting love song Timber Timbre  —   a band that has always possessed a brilliance for capturing frustrated laments to the unrequited  —   has ever written. It opens, after a wash of those   synths, with a buried bass and a   drumline, while Kirk quietly  : ”Timing’s off   And everything’s lost   And I know it.   Elixirs wear off   And each dose the cost   Of a memory.” The frustration of feeling undeserving, of loving what you have in your hands despite that shame, is run ashore by the song’s ending, a jagged, perpendicular tantrum of pure frustration. (That character in ”Moment,” questioning what he deserves, his agency, and the means to keep or throw it away, is a continual presence in Kirk’s work.) Sincerely, Future Pollution is an agitated document for surreal times. Where Timber Timbre would previously beckon us into its slinking visions of wintertime woods or 16mm strip clubs, this time Kirk is drawn toward us. The group sounds, understandably, wary of the reversal. Sincerely, Future Pollution is out April 7 on City Slang Records.",-0.5
"Drayson Technologies raises £8M for RF energy harvesting tech aimed at IoT devices and wearables – TechCrunch. There’s no such thing as a free lunch or free energy, right? Not necessarily. Drayson Technologies, the London startup founded by Lord Paul Drayson, a successful serial entrepreneur and former U.K. government science minister, is commercialising technology that harvests energy from radio frequency (RF) signals to potentially power a range of low-consumption devices. These include products in the IoT space, including the company’s own proof-of-concept air pollution sensor, and even wearables that don’t require too much power. To further develop the “Freevolt” tech and to help bring more applications to market, through licensing as well as building new products in-house, Drayson Technologies has raised £8 million in Series B funding. The round was led by existing investors Lansdowne Partners, and Woodford Investment Management, with participation from new unnamed investors and staff of the U.K. company. In a call, Drayson acknowledged that the concept and promise of harvesting RF for energy use has been kicking around since the 1960s and even before that, but said that the Freevolt technology, which itself owes much of its development to research spun out of London’s Imperial College, is a major improvement on the efficiency of harvesting errant or otherwise wasted energy contained in RF waves, including that transmitted by WiFi, cellular and digital broadcasts. Specifically this relates to the Freevolt harvester’s multi-band antenna and rectifier, which Drayson Technologies says is capable of absorbing energy from multiple RF bands at almost any orientation. However, there are two other elements that make the technology more viable today than at any other time. These are the fact that there are exponentially more RF signals being broadcast, particularly in urban areas, and in turn more use-cases for devices that require low amounts of power but where charging or swapping out batteries is inconvenient. Here Drayson talks up the IoT space as a major candidate, such as beacons, sensors and low-powered wearables, and notes that unlike solar, devices don’t need to be in ‘line of sight’ with the energy source but can be buried or otherwise hidden. He also makes another compelling argument and one that reflects his own engineering background and interest in environmental technology, including the work he’s done on electric cars and wireless charging. Should the industry buy in to the Freevolt tech (or something similar), it could lead to more energy-efficient devices being designed in the first place. That’s because, rather than engineers saying, ‘how can I make room for a bigger battery,’ or expecting users to charge their devices more often, the promise of ‘free’ energy might make them design new types of low-powered devices from the get-go. This could either be through increasing power efficiency or by making different design decisions or trade offs. On that note, a smartwatch powered by Freevolt that wouldn’t require charging daily isn’t out of the question, says Drayson. Maybe the best things in life really are free.",0.0
"House Conservatives Warm to Compromise on Budget Impasse. ‘It would be a shame, but the sky won’t fall if we don’t do a budget. ” Those were Speaker Paul Ryan’s words as he kicked off Friday morning’s   meeting of the Republican conference, according to a source in the room. The sky may not literally fall, of course, if Republicans can’t cobble together a budget by the beginning of March. But as Ryan reiterated this morning, it would eradicate any chance of passing all twelve appropriations bills through regular order, forcing the House into a repeat of the omnibus spending negotiations that conservatives  —   and Ryan himself  —   have long sought to avoid. The current dilemma is this: a large swath of conservatives from both the Freedom Caucus and the Republican Study Committee are spooked by the thought of passing a budget that adheres to the $1. 07 trillion spending level agreed upon by President Obama and   John Boehner in October. Their reasoning is both fiscal and political. A recent CBO report predicted that the   deal would further balloon the nation’s   debt. And for those members in heavily red districts, the backlash for supporting such a spending expansion  —   especially as conservative groups such as Heritage Action implore them to reject it  —   could be severe. RELATED: House GOP Divided as Budget Fight Looms, “Are House Republicans willing to give up appropriations bills, a balanced budget, entitlement reform, and reconciliation for $40 million?” Ryan then asked, according to the source.   “It was a compelling case,” says Ohio representative Bob Gibbs after the conference. “I didn’t realize that $2. 97 billion was going to defense. ” Ryan then turned the discussion over to the members. Harris took the microphone and laid out the vision that many conservatives increasingly believe could get them to support the October framework, giving leadership the 218 votes it needs to pass the budget: While maintaining that topline figure, Republicans could embed entitlement cuts into the budget, and strip out that spending in each appropriations bill. “People have always been focused on the wrong number in this debate,” says Budget Committee member Tom Cole. “The real problem is entitlement reform. I respect folks that are worried about spending money. I consider myself a deficit hawk. But we did make a deal. ” And according to both Gibbs and a leadership member inside the room, Harris’s pitch generated excitement. “It seems to be the best chance at compromise,” the member says. “The quandary is the path toward getting 218 votes on the floor. It’s an acknowledged problem,” Harris says in a phone interview after the conference. “I think this plan alleviates the problem. ” He says that he’s spent the past two days lobbying members to support the idea, and that it’s gained “wide acceptance” within the conference. Various smaller political problems have already been labeled Ryan’s “first big test” as speaker. But when it comes to carrying out the agenda he’s made his calling card, and prioritizing regular order in the House, passing a budget could very well be the test that his speakership has been driving toward since its inception. Harris’s proposal is charting a clearer pathway toward passing that test, but there is still aggressive pressure from other conservatives to lower the topline figure altogether, reverting to spending levels established by the 2011 sequester. Indeed, Freedom Caucus leaders Jim Jordan, Mick Mulvaney, Mark Meadows, and Raul Labrador continue to insist that, as Jordan puts it, “The answer is really simple: write a Republican budget. ” Share article on FacebookshareTweet The group rejects the argument that adhering to the   deal is the only way to move their appropriations bills into the Senate. “For the   budget deal, I remember Hal Rogers going around and saying the appropriations process can finally work. And yet we have not passed a single appropriations bill out of Congress since I got here,” Mulvaney says. “So when we’re told, ‘Oh, in order for the appropriations process to work, boys, you have to vote for this thing,’ we’re like, ‘Look, you told us that in   and the Senate lied to us. “So we’re not going to get lied to again. That’s not a selling point. Because we don’t believe you. ” They are careful to note, however, that blame for the impasse doesn’t fall on Ryan, but rather the broader conference, including caucuses such as the Tuesday Group, whose leader, Charlie Dent, has pledged that his group won’t vote for a return to sequestration levels. “The issue is that the rest of the conference just isn’t as fiscally conservative as this group,” Labrador says. Meadows says that the group is still looking for “something of value” that they could justify as a “ ” for voting on the higher number, but they haven’t reached an official consensus on what that something would be. The four lawmakers reiterate that their ultimate goal aligns with leadership’s: produce a budget, whatever shape it may take. But the influence of some Freedom Caucus members adamantly opposed to the higher spending levels, coupled with pressure from outside conservative groups, could continue to make that task difficult: If a large swath of conservative members votes against leadership’s budget, it would inevitably cause several others outside the group to do so as well, according to one member who is not in the Freedom Caucus and holds a leadership post. “No one wants to go home to their district and be lambasted for not standing with other conservatives in the conference,” says the member. “I think the Freedom Caucus has a lot more leverage than leadership realizes. ” What’s more, both the Heritage Foundation and its political arm, Heritage Action, are beseeching members to oppose the deal. In a new development this week, the Heritage Foundation is preparing to drop its own budget proposal with a topline figure of $990 billion that would balance in seven years, according to Paul Winfree, executive director of the think tank’s Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Studies. And that’s a real factor, as Heritage’s political arm maintains a   operation that holds sway with many conservative voters when it comes time to reelect their representatives. More Congress The Medicaid Spending Caps Are More Complex Than They Seem423 to 4The Left Espouses Dangerously Stupid   RhetoricNone of this is news to Ryan, and according to several GOP leadership aides, it’s the reason a large swath of his meetings this week have been with small groups of conservatives, rather than the whole conference. On Tuesday evening in the Capitol, he huddled with a handful of    members  —   including freshman Budget Committee member Gary Palmer and   ally Mark Walker  —   to pitch his case for leadership’s budget. “It was well received,” says an aide to one member present at the meeting. “The speaker knows that in order to get the votes he needs, he’s going to have to make more personal appeals, and he’s doing that. ” The House is in recess for the next week, during which time budget talk will be largely limited to    conversations between members. The overwhelming sentiment pouring out of this morning’s conference was that an agreement is likely to be struck the week of the 22nd. And even that may be pushing it: right now, the Budget Committee is sticking to its preset goal of a February 25th markup. Getting there continues to be no easy climb: According to interviews with nearly a dozen members from all factions of the Republican conference, the current budget debate is exposing ideological fissures between leadership and conservatives in a way that no event in Ryan’s speakership has thus far. But of those members, not a single one says they believe that, at the end of the day, the House won’t pass a budget. And with Harris’s proposal beginning to catch on among conservatives, that seems like a safer bet than it did a few days ago. Says one GOP leadership source: “They will pass one come hell or high water, but it may take both hell and high water. ”,",1.0
"Romance is dead – how sex killed the love song. Name: The love song. Age: Many hundreds of years old. Status: In decline. Oh, hardly. The love song is one of the most enduring romantic gestures in the history of humanity. Tell that to the music charts, buster. Why? What’s happened? According to research published in the journal Sexuality  Culture, pop songs are now less likely to be about love than at any point since the 1960s. That can’t be right. Let me go and check the charts. Be my guest. Right, the No 1 song at the moment is Despacito (remix) (feat Justin Bieber) by Luis Fonsi  Daddy Yankee. And what are the lyrics, exactly? “You fit me   love how you put it on   Got the only key, know how to turn it on   The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear   Baby, take it slow so we can last long. ” See? That’s a love song. No, it isn’t. That’s about sex. What’s the difference? OK, let’s take a classic love song. Say, Let’s Stay Together by Al Green from 1971. That’s a meditation on the satisfaction of weathering a rocky relationship. It’s an acknowledgment that monogamy can bring spiritual enrichment. Right. And Despacito is about Justin Bieber asking a woman to help him stop climaxing too quickly. Ah, gotcha. This isn’t a   either. The research analysed 1, 250 songs released between 1960 and 2008, and found that, while only 7% of songs from the 60s were about sex, that number had increased to 40% by the end of the study. Really? Why? The study points the finger at rap music, which turned up in the 1990s and was generous in its discussion of roving genitals. So is this actually a problem? Well, probably not when you realise that love has almost always been a euphemism for sex in music. The Look of Love is about sex. Ticket to Ride is about sex. If anything, all this shows is that censorship has relaxed over the last 50 years. And anyway, only a fool would look for moral guidance from a pop song. So what’s the solution? There isn’t one. Although if anybody fancies castrating Justin Bieber, I’m sure that wouldn’t hurt. Do say: “I want to hold your hand   …    ” Don’t say: “  …     While you diddle me something rotten in your sex dungeon. ”",-0.5
"No Magic in How G.O.P. Plan Lowers Premiums: It Pushes Out Older People - The New York Times. There are a lot of unpleasant numbers for Republicans in the Congressional Budget Office’s assessment of their health care bill. But congressional leadership found one to cheer: The report says that the bill will eventually cut the average insurance premiums for people who buy their own insurance by 10 percent. House Speaker Paul Ryan pressed that point in a series of appearances Monday night, suggesting that the budget office had found that the House bill would increase choice and competition and lead to lower prices. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, issued a statement saying, “The Congressional Budget Office agrees that the American Health Care Act will ultimately lower premiums and increase access to care. ” But the way the bill achieves those lower average premiums has little to do with increased choice and competition. It depends, rather, on penalizing older patients and rewarding younger ones. According to the C. B. O. report, the bill would make health insurance so unaffordable for many older Americans that they would simply leave the market and join the ranks of the uninsured. The remaining pool of people would be comparatively younger and healthier and, thus, less expensive to cover. Other changes would help make health insurance skimpier  —   cheaper, but with deductibles that are higher than those criticized by Republicans under Obamacare. Under the G. O. P. bill, the C. B. O. finds that insurance premiums would first spike, by 15 percent to 20 percent more than under Obamacare over the next two years. But by the end of a decade, the average plan would cost 10 percent less than it would under the Affordable Care Act. (Over all, though, 24 million fewer people would have insurance, it found.) Insurers price their products by spreading out the cost of care for their customers. In general, older customers cost substantially more to cover than younger ones because they have more health needs and use their insurance more. By discouraging older people from buying insurance, the plan will lower the average sticker price of care. But that doesn’t mean prices will get lower for everyone. Currently, the subsidies under Obamacare are devised to help limit how much   and   Americans can be asked to pay for health insurance. The Republican plan works differently. It increases the amount that insurers can charge older customers, and it awards flat subsidies by age, up to an income of $75, 000. On premiums alone, prices would rise by more than 20 percent for the oldest group of customers. By 2026, the budget office projected, “premiums in the nongroup market would be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a    and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a     —   but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a   . ” But the change in tax credits matters more. The combined difference in how much extra the older customer would have to pay for health insurance is enormous. The C. B. O. estimates that the price an average    earning $26, 500 would need to pay after using a subsidy would increase from $1, 700 under Obamacare to $14, 600 under the Republican plan. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the C. B. O. concludes that many, many fewer    will continue buying insurance in this market. By 2026, the uninsured rate for those 50 to 64 earning less than about $30, 000 would more than double, from around 12 percent to around 30 percent. Those older customers who would lose out on insurance coverage are more likely than the young customers who would buy it to need help paying big medical bills. Mr. Ryan has said that it is appropriate that the G. O. P. plan will cause more Americans to go without health insurance because it doesn’t have a mandate that people buy coverage or pay a penalty. “We’re saying the government’s not going to force people to buy something that they don’t want to buy,” he said on Fox News Monday afternoon. “And if we end an Obamacare mandate that says you must buy this government     plan, guess what? People aren’t going to buy that. ” But the C. B. O. did not conclude that insurer competition would increase in this new policy environment, or drive down premium prices. And poor, older customers whose insurance costs more than half their income may not really have much of a choice. The Republican plan is designed to pass using a special budget procedure requiring only 50 votes in the Senate. As a result, it doesn’t do much to change the regulations on health insurance that many Republicans believe have made insurance costly under Obamacare. Insurers will still need to charge sick and healthy customers of the same age the same price. And all plans will still need to cover a minimum package of benefits that include maternity care and treatment for drug addiction. The bill does make some changes to how much health insurance plans can ask customers to pay before their coverage kicks in. Under Obamacare, poorer customers get help not just with their premiums but with deductibles and   for their plans. That means that even the hypothetical older customer who could pony up $14, 600 for insurance under the G. O. P. plan would also pay substantially more out of pocket for any health care services. And changes to the requirements for health plans mean that, across the board, deductibles and   will increase. So the average plan that the C. B. O. says will be cheaper will also be less generous than a comparable Obamacare plan. Finally, the C. B. O. concludes that new funding in the law, intended to compensate insurance companies for the cost of caring for the sickest patients, may also help stabilize premiums. That provision is set to expire after 2026, just after the C. B. O. ’s evaluation period ends.",-1.0
"Study: Jupiter’s role in solar system helped Earth.  (CNN) It turns out that Jupiter may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system. We earthlings might have the giant planet to thank for our very existence. Two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of ” ”    planets that were larger than our own but smaller than Neptune. Jupiter, however, put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits, bulldozing in and sweeping them into the sun, according to a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  Jupiter’s epic,   journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of Earth and the other smaller planets nearby    Mercury, Venus and Mars. ”Our work suggests that Jupiter’s   migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the   terrestrial planets that our solar system has today,” said Konstantin Batygin of Caltech, one of the authors of the paper. Galactic outlier, The theory attempts to explain why our solar system is a bit of an oddball in our galactic neighborhood. Most other systems that have planets orbiting around a star similar to our sun look very different. They generally have at least one planet significantly larger than Earth that’s in a closer orbit than Mercury’s. But they don’t have many objects farther out. Maybe that’s because of Jupiter’s destructive romp in the early history of the solar system. ”There is no reason to think that the dominant mode of planet formation throughout the galaxy should not have occurred here,” Batygin said. ”It is more likely that subsequent changes have altered its original makeup.” He and his      Gregory Laughlin of University of California, Santa Cruz    are building on a scenario of Jupiter’s migration that was previously put forward by other scientists. Dance with Saturn, Known as the Grand Tack scenario, it describes Jupiter getting drawn toward the sun in the early era of the solar system thanks to its huge mass.  What stops it from being sucked right into the sun is Saturn. The two gas giants start to exert gravitational influence on one another, entering a planetary dance that eventually sends them back farther out into the solar system. Batygin and Laughlin suggest that during its inward journey, Jupiter dragged a load of planetary building blocks, known as planetesimals, along with it.  That sent the planetesimals smashing into debris in the inner solar system, causing them to break apart and fall into the sun at a faster rate. Swept into the sun, The scientists say they ran a simulation of what would happen if there were also a number of   in the vicinity as well. They found that a wave of decaying planetesimals would steer the   into the sun over the course of 20, 000 years. ”It’s a very effective physical process,” Batygin said. ”You only need a few Earth masses worth of material to drive tens of Earth masses worth of planets into the sun.” On its way back out, Jupiter left some remaining planetesimals in its wake    the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form Earth, Mercury, Venus and Mars.",-1.0
"VIDEO: See the Gun Battle That Led to El Chapo’s Capture - Breitbart. Mexican authorities have released a video to the Mexican TV station Televisa that shows the fierce gun battle that eventually led to the capture of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman Loera. [The video shows the moment Mexican Marines storm the house where El Chapo had been staying and the fierce resistance that the drug lord’s gunmen put up.   The operation was dubbed by the Mexican government as “Black Swan”.  In the early minutes you can see a Mexican Marine be shot and his team mates cover him as they continue trying to move into the various rooms of the house.  In addition to gunfire, the military had to use grenades and explosives to counter the similar armament that El Chapo’s men used.  As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, the fighting resulted in multiple arrests as well as five dead gunmen.  Interestingly the video shows at least one man in tactical gear who appears to be the commanding officer and is not in uniform but wears a red sweat shirt instead. The man out of uniform has sparked various debates on social media as to the man’s role. Those speculating ask if the man is a Mexican federal agent, a U.

"Aus Open: Nadal beats Zverev in epic. Melbourne  (CNN) Rafael Nadal thought he would be tested by Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open.  He was right    but the   grand slam winner overcame his younger,   foe in five sets Saturday to maintain his chances of claiming a first major since 2014 at Roland Garros.  Matching, or perhaps exceeding, the drama of Denis Istomin’s stunning upset of   tournament champion Novak Djokovic on Thursday, the Spaniard and    German slugged it out before Nadal prevailed       ( )     in four hours, six minutes on Rod Laver Arena.  ”For the confidence, for a lot of things, (it’s) very important to win these kinds of matches,” Nadal told reporters. ”I worked a lot during all December to have the chances to compete well in these kinds of moments.  ”Even if I started the match with some nerves, I think I was able to come back, no?”  He was indeed although when Zverev claimed the third set    he capped the set with a devastating   backhand    it appeared as if the brash    was on his way to collecting a fourth straight victory over a   rival. But Nadal broke early in the fourth to start his comeback.  Nadal had lost his last three fifth sets and relinquished break leads in his last two to Lucas Pouille and Fernando Verdasco in 2016.  And preying on those Nadal nerves    frequently clubbing that backhand    the   Zverev reversed a   deficit to level the fifth.  He proceeded to win the longest rally of the match    an exhausting 37 shots    at   deuce, but that point tipped the balance in the   ’s favor. Zverev    who held a match point when he lost to Nadal last year in Indian Wells    began cramping in his legs and didn’t win another game.  ”I still had game points to go up ” Zverev told reporters. ”I lost my service game I think because of that a little bit.” Nadal clinched the contest by forcing an forehand error, then stood on the baseline and roared, ”Come on.” ”I lost the last couple of ones, matches in the fifth, so it’s important for me to win a match like this, losing two sets to one,” said Nadal. ”Very happy.” ’Going to be awesome’ Conchita Martinez, Spain’s Davis Cup captain, added to CNN: ”I think for his mental state it’s going to be awesome. It’s going to be really good for his confidence.  ”He’s trained really hard, so he’s done his work. He’s confident about that so, I don’t want to say after this he’s going to be dangerous    he is dangerous any way. We’ll see how he recovers.  ”Physically I see him strong, so I think he’s in good shape.”   One more win for Nadal, against flamboyant Frenchman Gael Monfils on Monday, and he’ll land in a first grand slam quarterfinal since the 2015 French Open. Nadal leads Monfils in their duels   so he’ll be favored.  Visit cnn.  for more news and videos, With nemesis Djokovic having made an early departure, there may be a golden opportunity for Nadal to go even further.   His main coach, his uncle Toni, was being cautious, however.  ”If this was an important win or not, I don’t know,” he told CNN. ”I’ll tell you when the tournament is over.”",-1.0
"Video: Tsunami Hits Near Damaged Nuclear Plant on Japan’s Coast - Breitbart. Thousands of residents of numerous prefectures of Japan, including the troubled Fukushima area, evacuated their homes Tuesday morning following a magnitude 7. 4 earthquake and subsequent tsunami warnings. [Fearing a similar disaster to that of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that shut down Fukushima’s   nuclear plant, causing untold environmental damage to the region, residents began to flee shortly after the earthquake.  “My home is right across from the nursing home where many elderly people died in the tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake,” one resident, Sachiko Nakagawa, told the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. “When I learned that a tsunami warning had been issued, I knew I had to escape, so I jumped into my car. ” Asahi Shimbun, another Japanese newspaper, reported that Nakagawa was among 9, 000 people who evacuated their homes immediately. Japan’s NHK reports that authorities have yet to document any deaths as a result of the earthquake, and only an estimated 15 injuries so far. Many of these are incidents in which elderly individuals lost their balance during the earthquake one incident involved a septuagenarian woman injured by her overhead cupboard falling. Asahi notes that the tsunami threat has reduced now that the largest expected waves have hit over a meter in height. While the threat of further damage from this quake is limited, the newspaper quotes seismologist Koji Nakamura as warning that aftershocks are common, and another “quake with a magnitude of 7 or so striking over the next week” is not outside of the realm of possibility. As the regional evacuation was largely successful, few videos of the tsunami hitting the ocean have surfaced. Instead, however, social media users have published the oversized waves that hit the rivers in the areas to which they evacuated, lending a hint to how powerful these waves once were upon hitting land initially.  津波 pic. twitter.   —    (ry (@sarusuberi_masa) November 21, 2016,  Suenan las sirenas en Fukushima, Japón, alertando un tsunami tras el sismo de magnitud 6. 9 que sacudió ese país. pic. twitter.   —   Jean Suriel (@JeanSuriel) November 21, 2016,  Once authorities allow residents to safely return, they must assess both the damage to private property and that of the famed Fukushima nuclear plants. Fukushima’s Daiichi (Number 1) plant suffered a meltdown in 2011 following a significantly larger earthquake and tsunami, forcing the prolonged evacuation of the area surrounding the plant. Five years later, families remain scattered, as some elderly refused to evacuate due to the radiation, while some men, unable to find new jobs, were forced to stay in the radiation zones to provide for their wives and children, now living hundreds of miles away. While Japan has indicted some Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) officials for negligence over the 2011 meltdown, early reports from Fukushima’s Daini (Number 2) inspire little confidence. Shortly following Tuesday’s earthquake, the Daini’s cooling apparatus “temporarily shut down,” potentially causing another meltdown. Daini is located about 7 miles from Daiichi. TEPCO authorities have provided little explanation for the incident and admit they have not checked whether the shutdown resulted in toxic materials leaking out of the plant. Asahi notes that TEPCO has claimed the evacuation of their staff has prevented them from checking “for possible leaks around the reactor buildings and the turbine buildings near the sea,” but they nonetheless insist such a leak is “unlikely. ” A TEPCO representative described the fact that they have yet to check for leaks as “a bit inappropriate. ” They have vowed to “study” the response to the Daini incident following the return of those evacuated to the area.",1.0
"Kevin Durant Signs Two-Year Deal with the Golden State Warriors - Breitbart. The rich just got richer. [Vaunted free agent Kevin Durant announced on Monday his decision to join the Golden State Warriors. The signing gives the team coming off the best regular season in NBA history the league’s top free agent (at least of the ones actually looking for a new team) and provides $54 million in salary over two years to a player who signed a sneaker deal with Nike in 2014 that could hit $300 million in value over the life of the contract.  “The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player  —   as that has always steered me in the right direction,” Durant wrote at the Players’ Tribune. “But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. ” Drama surrounded Durant’s decision. His hometown of Washington, DC, hoped to entice him to sign with the Wizards and Tom Brady traveled to the Hamptons to fete Durant on behalf of the Boston Celtics. But a   phone conversation with the man behind the silhouette on the NBA logo proved most persuasive. Jerry West, a member of the executive board of the Golden State Warriors, told the   NBA MVP that he never felt satisfied as a player until he could finally win a title. Durant desperately wants a ring and the Warriors could easily get one this coming season. Both sides possessed what the other wanted.  The    scored 28 points, grabbed eight rebounds, and dished five assists per game this past season. The Warriors, who won a record 73 games during the regular season and fell points short of repeating as champions in the postseason, enter the   campaign as prohibitive favorites with the addition of Durant. The deal allows Durant to opt out next year, when Steph Curry also looks to obtain a max contract. “I’m from Washington, D. C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me,” Durant confessed at the Players’ Tribune. “It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. ”",1.0
"Comey expected to testify openly about Trump .  (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey has told the Senate intelligence committee he won’t be constrained in discussing his conversations with President Donald Trump, Chairman Richard Burr said Monday. Burr said he’s spoken several times to Comey and he expects the former FBI director to talk in detail about his conversations with Trump when he testifies openly Thursday before the committee. But Comey is expected to abstain from discussing the ongoing federal Russia investigation, a Senate intelligence committee source told CNN. The broad boundaries, relayed by Comey to Burr and Vice Chairman Mark Warner last week, comes after Comey’s discussions with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the agency’s probe into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said Monday he has not yet spoken to Mueller about Comey’s expected testimony. He added he does not think he needs to talk to Mueller before Comey’s hearing but he does expect to. ”As far as I’m concerned anything that would be   would have to be expressed by the former director,” Burr said of Mueller. Burr and Warner, a Virginia Democrat, met Monday with acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and Burr said he raised the issue of Comey’s memos about his dealings with Trump. ”I’d love to see the director’s memos (before the hearing) but I don’t think I will,” Burr said. The meeting with McCabe was not primarily about Comey’s testimony, the senators said. Burr also told CNN that former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, a focus of the Russia probe, had turned over some of the documents to the Senate intelligence committee in response to a subpoena they issued last month. A Flynn source told CNN they will submit ”some documents soon based on their narrowed document requests after we objected.” Comey’s memos are of particular interest to congressional investigators following reports last month that the   director wrote a memo following a meeting with Trump, detailing how the President allegedly asked Comey to end the investigation into Flynn. CNN has not viewed the memo but did have the memo described by sources familiar with the matter. Trump later denied Comey’s description of the meeting. McCabe is one of several top administration officials testifying at a Wednesday intelligence committee hearing on a key National Security Agency surveillance law tool that expires at the end of the year. Burr said he understood that the decision on the Comey memos was a ”Justice Department determination.” The White House said Monday it would not invoke executive privilege to prevent Comey from testifying.

"AmazonFresh Cranks Up Pressure On British Supermarkets. LONDON (Reuters)  —   Amazon has launched a British version of its U. S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets already locked in a brutal price war. [In a   move to break into Britain’s 178 billion pounds ($257 billion) grocery market, the world’s largest online retailer launched AmazonFresh on Thursday in parts of central and east London.  Britain has one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets with the big four retailers Tesco, Sainsbury’s,  ’s Asda and Morrisons already competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado. The online grocery bar is even higher in the capital. “The entry of AmazonFresh into the UK doesn’t come out of the blue but it will further worry investors about the fundamentals and prospects of the UK food retail market,” said Bernstein analysts, who estimate Amazon could eventually take up to 13 percent of all food sales in the country. Britain’s online food market is expected to nearly double to 17. 2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD. “We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service,” AmazonFresh vice president Ajay Kavan said. AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service from a distribution centre in the east of the capital. It plans to use small and   external carriers for deliveries, which could be on the same day as the order. UK ROLLOUT, Shares in Britain’s listed supermarkets have been hammered in recent years as the grocery market has been convulsed by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and price competition, and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time. “We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK,” Kavan said. Shoppers in the eligible London districts, or postcodes, who are members of the Amazon Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a range of more than 130, 000 products, including about 20, 000 grocery items. Amazon will offer fresh and frozen products from Morrisons, with which it struck a wholesale supply deal in February, brands including   Kellogg’s, Danone, Warburtons and Walkers as well as products from local food producers and shops in locations such as London’s trendy Borough Market. Amazon Prime members in the United Kingdom pay an annual subscription of 79 pounds. They can sign up for a   trial of AmazonFresh and would then pay 6. 99 pounds per month for the service, with unlimited deliveries for orders over 40 pounds. IMPACT, In the short term, Bernstein analysts reckon AmazonFresh’s focus on London and its upmarket bias could mean Sainsbury’s is hit the most out of the Big Four. But they said Tesco and Ocado are also exposed as they have the largest share of   online food sales. There was, however, little impact on stock prices following the AmazonFresh launch. In April, Sainsbury’s agreed a 1. 4 billion pound takeover of Argos, a move which was seen as a defensive play against Amazon. One food retail executive from one of the big four players said Amazon would only significantly disrupt the market if it could successfully target the 60 percent of store sales that are just small baskets. “If Amazon can work out how to deliver those top up shops profitably and in a timely manner then I think we’ll see other retailers respond and that’s likely to grow the overall market share of online sales from around the 7 percent mark and accelerate the growth,” he told Reuters. Amazon launched a fresh food delivery service in Seattle in 2007 and has since moved to a handful of other U. S. cities, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model. It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Prime members in Britain.

"’We feel very close to her’: can ’fake feminist’ Marine Le Pen win the female vote?. In a room normally used for an evening bridge club, Christiane, 60, was clutching a plate of cured pork sausage with a mini French flag stuck in it at a   drink for Front National supporters. Dressed in colourful knitwear and a chunky wooden necklace, she used to vote Communist and was a feminist who burned her bra in the 1970s. But she now wants Marine Le Pen to be president. Christiane, a former TV freelancer, said it was her “experience as a woman” that had led her to gradually shift to the far right. “I was pregnant, single and in financial difficulty so I went to inquire about benefits, but I was entitled to nothing. Yet next to me there was a Pakistani woman with an interpreter who was entitled to everything. Something was not right,” she said. “We can’t give everything away without protecting our own. When I tried to get housing help, I was told: ‘Move back in with your mother.’ I raised my son on my own in a studio flat in a block in northern Paris there was a rape below me,   cars. ” Christiane added: “My path to the Front National came from anger, disillusionment, disgust, revolt. This party brings together people who have been disappointed  —   that’s why they are progressing. I’ve got female friends who once said they would never vote Front National, but this time they are swayed. We don’t have rights and benefits any more everything is given to outsiders. ” Female voters are crucial for Le Pen’s bid to become France’s first female president. Polls currently show Le Pen reaching the final round in May, but unable to get the 50% needed to win the presidency. It is female voters who could boost her score. Traditionally, more women register to vote than men in France, but they are also more likely to abstain. Le Pen, who avoids the word feminist, is now pushing her feminine side in campaign videos and special pamphlets designed for female voters. She presents herself as a   single mother who worked as a lawyer and had three babies in one year  —   a daughter, immediately followed by twins. The Front National has a tricky history with female voters. For decades under Le Pen’s father, the macho     Le Pen, the party suffered from a gender gap. Far fewer women than men voted for a party which from the start vehemently opposed abortion rights  —   it called the legalisation of abortion “an   genocide”  —   and pushed a traditionalist view of women as childbearers and homemakers. But in the last presidential election in 2012, when Le Pen had taken over from her father, the gender gap started to close (even though it emerged again during the local and regional elections of the past two years).  Le Pen has toned down the party’s stance on abortion and no longer wants to roll back its legalisation  —   even if her popular niece, the MP Marion Maréchal Le Pen, is staunchly   and has talked about cutting subsidies for family planning. Marine Le Pen’s new campaign logo  —   a blue rose instead of the party’s traditional flame  —   was conceived for its supposed feminine appeal.  The courting of young women’s votes is all about not scaring them off  —   one recent survey showed more women than men still believed the far right was “dangerous for democracy”. Florian Philippot, Le Pen’s chief strategist, told the Guardian: “I don’t know how many times I’ve heard young women say they voted against us in an election second round because they were  —   wrongly  —   convinced we’re going to ban the pill or ban abortion. It’s totally false and it’s harmful for our second round vote. ” But the key focus of Le Pen’s wooing of women is to push her   stance  —   emphasising what she calls the threat of creeping “Islamist fundamentalism” that is “rolling back women’s rights” in France. After the mass sexual assaults and muggings by groups of men in Cologne in Germany during New Year’s Eve celebrations in 2016, Le Pen wrote an opinion piece in France describing immigration as a threat to women’s rights, saying it risked bringing “social regression” to France. She wrote: “I am scared that the migrant crisis signals the beginning of the end of women’s rights. ” Le Pen has said she would like to ban the hijab, or Muslim headscarf, from all public spaces. On International Women’s Day this week, she said that every woman must be protected in their right, if they chose, “to wear shorts or a miniskirt”. On a visit to Lebanon last month, Le Pen refused to wear a headscarf to meet a senior Muslim official and pointedly cancelled her meeting  —   sending a signal to her voters.  Far from women’s rights issues, the key concern of many women voting Front National remains immigration. “The number one reason I vote Front National is Islam,” said Nicole, 80, a former art teacher from the smart 16th arrondissement of Paris. “Everything else can be resolved, but we have let Islam slip into this country. There’s too much Islam here. ” Sophie, 32, a   artist educated to postgraduate level, was breastfeeding her    baby as she listened to Le Pen’s campaign director address a crowd of supporters. She used to live in a diverse area of Paris. “As a woman I feel threatened by the rise in radical Islam,” she said. “I was fed up with   when I walked down the street in a skirt. For some groups of men, if your head isn’t covered and you dress as French, you’re a prostitute. ” She added: “But it’s difficult because I come from a leftwing family. I feel I can’t talk to them about my vote. ” Among the female voters who choose Le Pen, retail workers stand out. She has gained a significant share of the vote among women in this sector, including supermarket cashiers and shop assistants, who often face poor pay and conditions.  In recent weeks, Le Pen has been ambushed by feminist campaigners outside events. At the Paris farm show, two feminists seeking to award her a prize “for being an impostor for the   defence of women” were removed by Le Pen’s security team. Last month, a topless campaigner from the Femen group stormed a Le Pen conference on foreign policy shouting: “Marine: fake feminist!” The historian Valérie Igounet, whose recent book L’Illusion Nationale covers two years of research in towns currently run by Front National mayors, said: “Just as with other topics, when the Front National tackles the issue of women, it is really talking about immigration. It is immigration that underlies everything. ” She added: “The Front National is far from a party that is feminist and respects all rights of women. ” Miriam, 63, a secondary school teacher who worked in a diverse neighbourhood of Paris said she felt more female teachers around her were becoming open to the Front National. “It feels like there is less security in the capital,” she said. “For me the problem of immigration is essential. We’re losing France and real French values. ” The fact that Le Pen was a woman meant “she has a certain sensitivity” Miriam said. “There’s a community of spirit. We feel very close to her as a female candidate. ”",-0.5
"N.J. Town Must Pay Islamic Group $3.25 Million To Settle Discrimination Lawsuit . A New Jersey town must pay $3. 25 million to a local Islamic society and allow it to build a mosque, ending a   dispute. This is the result of settlements finalized on Tuesday stemming from two separate federal lawsuits against Bernards Township, in central New Jersey. The $3. 25 million settles the lawsuit filed by the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge. And the ISBR will be allowed to move forward with its plans to build a mosque as a result of a lawsuit filed Justice Department. ”Federal law requires towns to treat religious land use applications like any other land use application,” acting U. S. Attorney of the District of New Jersey William Fitzpatrick said in a statement. ”Bernards Township made decisions that treated the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge differently than other houses of worship.” Both the Justice Department and the ISBR argued that Bernards Township violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which protects ”individuals, houses of worship, and other religious institutions from discrimination in zoning and landmarking laws.” Mohammed Ali Chaudry, president of the society, told NJ. com that they are ”very pleased by this resolution and hope to receive prompt approval to build our mosque. . .. We look forward to welcoming people of all faiths and backgrounds to our mosque.” This dispute started in 2011, when the ISBR purchased a home with the intention of building a mosque in a residential zoning district where it was, at that time, acceptable to establish places of worship. But the plan was met with public opposition. The ISBR filed for site approval in 2012, which initiated 39 public hearings that spanned more than three years. ”The Planning Board has never held such a large number of hearings for any previous site plan application,” according to the Justice Department’s complaint. In Oct. 2013, the township enacted a new ordinance that ”amended the classification of a house of worship from a permitted use in residential zoning districts to a conditional use,” the complaint added. The new ordinance also required places of worship to be on a lot of at least 6 acres, larger than the   property where the ISBR wanted to build a mosque. Eight of the 11 houses of worship built and approved by the Planning Board before the rule was enacted were on lots smaller than 6 acres, the complaint says. The Planning Board ultimately rejected the application in 2015, saying it was particularly concerned about its number of parking spaces. The plans had 50 spaces allotted, at a ratio of one for every three worshippers, which is the usual standard applied to other places of worship. But the Planning Board said the mosque needed 107 spaces. The Justice Department said that higher number came from a ”traffic engineer hired by a group of mosque opponents,” while the town said it came from a report introduced by an expert hired by the plaintiffs. The planning board also said the mosque must follow more stringent   management and fire lane procedures than those required of other institutions, according to the complaint. Michael Turner, a spokesman for Bernards Township, denies the claims of discrimination. ”The Planning Board denial was based on legitimate land use and safety concerns which Plaintiffs refused to address,” Turner added. He said that the decision to settle was ”not made lightly” and that the township is a ”diverse and inclusive community.” The Associated Press notes two other recent lawsuits on the same issue in New Jersey. ”A similar lawsuit cost nearby Bridgewater Township almost $8 million in a 2014 settlement,” the wire service states. ”Last week, a Muslim group sued the city of Bayonne, claiming its proposal to convert an abandoned warehouse into a mosque and community center was unfairly voted down amid a climate of hostility and religious intolerance.”",-0.5
"Spatial helps users navigate like a native – TechCrunch. Lyden Foust was an ethnographer traveling the world on behalf of corporations, living in a city for months at a time to learn what he could, and reporting back to the people who hired him. “I realized people were telling their social media more than they would ever tell me as a researcher,” Foust said. And so he partnered with his friend Will Kiessling, a jet engine software engineer used to dealing with vast amounts of data, to create Spatial. Spatial pulls data from “tons and tons of social sources,” Foust said, then uses it in aggregate to help users understand the city like a local would. Spatial pulls from more than 30 sources, including Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Tinder, but also from apps like Strava to find out where people are riding their bikes and weather apps to learn what people do when it’s sunny or rainy or snowing. “If you look at one source, it’s totally junk ,” Foust said. “You can’t understand it . But looking at them in aggregate, you can ask what’s happening on Instagram when it’s raining.” Foust noted that there are many apps that try to get people from point A to point B, from their car’s navigation system to websites like Yelp. “The market is endless,” he said. So rather than building yet another app, Spatial is an API that any app maker or automotive company can license for their own use. In 2016, Spatial participated in the Techstars Mobility Accelerator program, and on Demo Day, the company announced a deal with Ford. “If you ask any of these apps, Where’s a Chinese restaurant?, that’s fine ,” Foust said. “But if you ask anything beyond that – conditional questions – you end up on Google for an hour.” Spatial pulls data from its dozens of sources to tell users which bars have sunset views over the water, or which neighborhoods have the best Christmas lights. Spatial is based in Detroit, which Foust said “makes it really difficult to raise money for an app.” Thus the decision to provide the API and sell directly to businesses. It’s a strategy that seems to have worked — Ford is the 9-month-old company’s largest customer, and Spatial expects to close a $2 million round of seed funding next week.",0.0

"Orlando Gunman Attacks Gay Nightclub, Leaving 50 Dead - The New York Times. ORLANDO, Fla.  —   A man who called 911 to proclaim allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist group, and who had been investigated in the past for possible terrorist ties, stormed a gay nightclub here Sunday morning, wielding an assault rifle and a pistol, and carried out the worst mass shooting in United States history, leaving 50 people dead and 53 wounded. The attacker, identified by law enforcement officials as Omar Mateen, a    who was born in New York, turned what had been a celebratory night of dancing to salsa and merengue music at the crowded Pulse nightclub into a panicked scene of unimaginable slaughter, the floors slicked with blood, the dead and the injured piled atop one another. Terrified people poured onto the darkened streets of the surrounding neighborhood, some carried wounded victims to safety, and police vehicles were pressed into service as makeshift ambulances to rush people to hospitals. Joel Figueroa and his friends “were dancing by the   area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam,” he said, adding, “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door. ” Pulse, which calls itself “Orlando’s Latin Hotspot,” was holding its weekly “Upscale Latin Saturdays” party. The shooting began around 2 a. m. and some patrons thought at first that the booming reports they heard were firecrackers or part of the loud, thumping dance music. Some people who were trapped inside hid where they could, calling 911 or posting messages to social media, pleading for help. The club posted a stark message on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running. ” Hundreds of people gathered in the glare of flashing red lights on the fringes of the law enforcement cordon around the nightclub, and later at area hospitals, hoping desperately for some word on the fates of their relatives and friends. More than 12 hours after the attack, anguished relatives paced between Orlando Regional Medical Center and a nearby hotel as they waited for word. They were told that so many were gunned down that victims would be tagged as anonymous until the hospital was able to identify them. “We are here suffering, knowing nothing,” said Baron Serrano, whose brother, Juan Rivera, 36, had been celebrating a friend’s birthday with his husband and was now unaccounted for. “I cannot understand why they can’t tell me anything because my brother is a very   person here in Orlando. He is a hairstylist, and everybody knows him. ” A tally of victims whose relatives had been notified began slowly building on a city website by 6 p. m. it had six names. Among them was Juan Ramon Guerrero, a    man of Dominican descent who had gone to the club with his boyfriend, Christopher Leinonen, who goes by the name Drew, because they wanted to listen to salsa. A friend, Brandon Wolf, watched people carry Mr. Guerrero outside, his body riddled with gunshot wounds. But no one knew what had become of Mr. Leinonen. His mother, Christine, anxious because of health problems, had woken at 3 a. m. to news of the shooting, and learned from Mr. Wolf that her son had been inside. A   standoff followed the initial assault, with people inside effectively held hostage until around 5 a. m. when law enforcement officials led by a SWAT team raided the club, using an armored vehicle and explosives designed to disorient and distract. Over a dozen police officers and sheriff’s deputies engaged in a shootout with Mr. Mateen, leaving him dead and an officer wounded, his life saved by a Kevlar helmet that deflected a bullet. At least 30 people inside were rescued, and even the hardened police veterans who took the building and combed through it, aiding the living and identifying the dead, were shaken by what they saw, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief. “Just to look into the eyes of our officers told the whole story,” he said. It was the worst act of terrorism on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001, and the deadliest attack on a gay target in the nation’s history, though officials said it was not clear whether some victims had been accidentally shot by law enforcement officers. The toll of 50 dead is larger than the number of murders in Orlando over the previous three years. Of an estimated 320 people in the club, nearly   were shot. The casualties far exceeded those in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were killed, and the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. where 26 people died. “In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” President Obama said in a special address from the White House. “We will not give in to fear or turn against each other. Instead, we will stand united as Americans to protect our people and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us. ” As he had done after several previous mass shootings, the president said the shooting demonstrated the need for what he called “ ” gun measures. “This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school or a house of worship or a movie theater or a nightclub,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. To actively do nothing is a decision as well. ” The shooting quickly made its way into the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who has accused Mr. Obama of weakness on radical Islam and has called for barring Muslim immigrants, suggested on Twitter that the president should resign. “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” he wrote. “I don’t want congrats, I want toughness  vigilance. We must be smart!” Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, released a statement saying: “We need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. ” Fears of violence led to heightened security at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender events and gathering places around the country. Law enforcement officials in Santa Monica, Calif. confirmed the arrest on Sunday of a heavily armed man who said he was in the area for West Hollywood’s gay pride parade. The authorities, however, said they did not know of any connection between the California arrest and the Orlando shooting. The F. B. I. investigated Mr. Mateen in 2013 when he made comments to   suggesting he had terrorist ties, and again the next year, for possible connections to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who became a suicide bomber in Syria, said Ronald Hopper, an assistant agent in charge of the bureau’s Tampa Division. But each time, the F. B. I. found no solid evidence that Mr. Mateen had any real connection to terrorism or had broken any laws. Still, he is believed to be on at least one watch list. Mr. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Fla. was able to continue working as a security guard with the security firm G4S, where he had worked since 2007, and he was able to buy guns. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Mr. Mateen had legally bought a long gun and a pistol in the past week or two, though it was not clear whether those were the weapons used in the assault, which officials described as a handgun and an   type of assault rifle. A former   Daniel Gilroy, said Mr. Mateen had talked often about killing people and had voiced hatred of gays, blacks, women and Jews. Around the time of the massacre, Mr. Mateen called 911 and declared his allegiance to the Islamic State, the brutal group that has taken over parts of Syria, Iraq and Libya, Agent Hopper said. Other law enforcement officials said he called after beginning his assault. Hours later, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility in a statement released over an encrypted phone app used by the group. It stated that the attack “was carried out by an Islamic State fighter,” according to a transcript provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist propaganda. But officials cautioned that even if Mr. Mateen, who court records show was briefly married and then divorced, was inspired by the group, there was no indication that it had trained or instructed him, or had any direct connection with him. Some other terrorist attackers have been “” including the pair who killed 14 people in December in San Bernardino, Calif. who also proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State, but apparently had no contact with the group. The Islamic State has encouraged “lone wolf” attacks in the West, a point reinforced recently by a group spokesman, Abu Muhammad   in his annual speech just before the holy month of Ramadan. In past years, the Islamic State and Al Qaeda ramped up attacks during Ramadan. American Muslim groups condemned the shooting. “The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence,” said Rasha Mubarak, the Orlando regional coordinator of the Council on   Relations.",-1.0
"U.S. List of Those Detained for Trump’s Travel Ban Is Called Incomplete - The New York Times. A month after President Trump’s executive order barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States caused tumult around the country, the government’s accounting of how many travelers the ban affected remains unclear. A total of 746 people were detained and processed in a   period immediately after a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 order, according to a list released by the government on Thursday. The figure was nearly seven times greater than the 109 people that Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 30 message on Twitter had been “held for questioning” and Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, said had been “inconvenienced. ” But, according to lawyers for some of those who were detained, 746 may be an incomplete figure. At a hearing before Judge Carol B. Amon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday, those lawyers challenged the veracity of the government’s list, saying they knew of at least 10 people who had been detained who were not included in the tally. Some detainees were forced to return to the countries from which they had come, despite having valid visas. The lawyers initially asked that the government provide them with a list of names so they could help people return to the United States. Joshua Press, a Justice Department trial lawyer, said at the hearing that a vast majority of those who were held were eventually allowed to enter the country and were legal permanent residents. He said he could not provide a specific number. The Justice Department referred a request for that figure to the Customs and Border Protection agency, which declined to comment because of the continuing litigation. At the hearing, Judge Amon ordered the government to inform the plaintiffs how many of the 746 people on the government’s list had been allowed to enter the country, and to investigate the cases the plaintiffs’ lawyers said had been omitted. The list included only the given name and surname of those who were detained and did not mention nationalities. Judge Amon had not ordered that contact information be included. “All we’re trying to do is put together a puzzle, to which the government has all the pieces,” said Muneer I. Ahmad, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. When Mr. Ahmad questioned why the people he and his colleagues cited were missing from the list, Mr. Press replied, “The government is not omniscient. ” Mr. Trump’s executive order was halted on Feb. 9 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Seattle. The Trump administration has said it plans to issue a revised order next week. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p. m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order. The case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a “snapshot” to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnelly’s ruling, from 9:37 p. m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p. m. on Jan. 29. The list provided by the government did not include refugees because they generally do not arrive on weekends, said Rebecca Heller, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. According to documents submitted to the court by the American Civil Liberties Union, some of those detained described having their phones confiscated, their requests to talk to lawyers denied and, in some cases, being coerced into signing forms that resulted in their deportation. Sara Yarjani, an Iranian citizen who is studying for a master’s degree in holistic health in California, was held for 23 hours at Los Angeles International Airport before being deported, after Judge Donnelly issued her ruling, according to court filings. Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who was born in Saudi Arabia and has a valid work visa, was detained at Kennedy Airport for 10 hours and deported, according to the filings. There is an urgent need to find those on the government’s list of people who were held, said Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer with the A. C. L. U. for detainees. He said he feared that those people might be forgotten once the Trump administration releases new travel restrictions. “We’re going to do our best to get everybody back, and then we’ll fight the new executive order,” Mr. Gelernt said.",-1.0

"Donald Trump Says Massive Legal Migration Is Eroding Middle Class - Breitbart. Donald Trump warned that both legal and illegal immigration are cutting Americans’ wages, following the release of a bombshell report from the Center for Immigration Studies which documents the nation’s record levels of immigration. [The report, which is based on 2015 U. S. Census data, found that 61 million immigrants and their U. S.  children now reside within the United States, including 15. 7 million of whom are illegal immigrants and their children.  “Almost one in five U. S. residents is now an immigrant or minor child of an immigrant parent,” the report states. “The numbers represent a complete break with recent history   …     as recently as 1970, there were only 13. 5 million immigrants and their young children in the country, accounting for one in 15 U. S. residents. ” In response, Trump’s statement said that “record rates of immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for U. S. workers. ” Pew polling shows 83 percent of all voters  —   Democrats, Republicans and Independents  —   think immigration should be frozen or reduced. The biggest beneficiaries of allowing fewer foreign workers into our country would be minority workers, including all immigrants now living here, who are competing for jobs, benefits and community resources against record waves of foreign workers. Limiting job competition would reopen pathways to   stability and shrink welfare rolls. In addition, it would relieve overcrowding in our schools and hospitals that afflict our poorest communities. Trump notes that both Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz have pushed to massively expand immigration levels, writing: “Senators Cruz and Rubio have led the charge for even higher immigration,” a policy supported by only seven percent of the Republican electorate. Indeed, Rubio introduced legislation that would triple green cards and double foreign workers, while Cruz pushed proposals to double the number of green cards and quintuple the annual inflow of   guest worker visas. Trump concludes his statement by pledging: “When I am President we will listen to the people  —   not the special interests  —   and get immigration numbers under control, as the voters have demanded. ”",1.0
"22 Year Old Swedish Asylum Centre Worker Stabbed To Death By Migrant - Breitbart. A young Swedish woman employed at an asylum centre has died following an attack by a migrant at the centre, the Swedish news agency TT has reported. [The victim, 22   Alexandra Mezher, was rushed to a nearby hospital after being stabbed repeatedly, but later died.  Swedish police have refused to comment on the identity of the man whois suspected of murdered her but have stated that he is under arrest and will be charged with murder or manslaughter and that he was a resident of the centre. The centre in Mölndal is primarily for unaccompanied minors aged  . The motive for the attack remains unknown and police have not commented to media extensively about the case. Police spokesman Christer Fuxborg did tell Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, “the woman who was taken to Sahlgrenska Hospital this morning died because of the injuries she received in connection with the altercation, relatives are informed. ” In Germany the violence toward LGBT people has grown so out of control that the city of Berlin has built special asylum centres just for them. The Lesbian and Gay association of   had at least 95 accusations of violence toward homosexual and transsexual refugees in the Berlin area from August to December of 2015 which occurred mostly in asylum centres.  Christians are another group that has been singled out by Muslim migrants for violence, leading an Orthodox Christian priest, Hegumen Daniil, to comment, “Christian Refugees from Syria, Eritrea, and other countries are exposed to humiliation, manhunt and brutal harassment at the camps for refugees by Muslim neighbours. ”  The sexual crimes of migrants made world headlines in the wake of the Cologne New Year’s attacks at the Cologne train station, but the frequency and severity of sex attacks within migrant camps is also a growing concern. A worker in a camp in Hamburg spoke out about the violence saying that at least 90 percent of the migrants were “unpleasant. ”  The social worker went on to talk about how the migrants view women saying, “they simply do not respect women at all,” and described how she had to dress more modestly to escape the sexual harassment from the migrants and even avoid, “going where lots of these single men are staying. ”  While there is a continuing trend of violence within the asylum centres, the murder of this young woman in Sweden might mark the first instance of a worker being killed by migrants.  Swedish police are currently being quiet about the case, which comes at a time they are under incredible pressure due to a report that accused police, government and media of covering up migrant crimes for years.",1.0
"Experience: I had a free birth. A free birth is one without medical assistance. For us, that meant no scans, no doctors and 58 hours of labour in our lounge: just me, my husband, Flynn, and our friend Claire. I’m 32 and a yoga teacher, so yoga and mindfulness have allowed me to understand and trust my body. I’m also practical. I looked at all the things that could go wrong, then all the things that could go right  —   and chose positivity. I fell pregnant with our little girl, Fox, in May 2016. At the beginning, I went to the GP but it wasn’t empowering. She described pregnancy as a “conveyor belt”. We attended our first midwife appointment but found ourselves questioning a lot of protocol, like getting flu jabs and booking scans. We moved house towards the end of my first trimester and I met the new midwife at the hospital but, again, it felt flat: no joy, nothing to celebrate this extraordinary experience. I told her we didn’t want scans, and she told us all these scary things: you could die your baby could die. But we asked for the stats and the chances were that wasn’t going to happen. I cried in the street  —   why would she want to make me question my own body?  —   and that’s when I made up my mind. We never extricated ourselves from the system we just didn’t go for   or scans. I recognised that things could go wrong and I might have changed my mind. I wasn’t foolish. During the pregnancy, I spent time connecting with my baby every day. From 16 weeks, I felt her moving and Flynn learned to find her heartbeat with his ear. I didn’t have the mental space to be challenged so I talked only to four close friends about it. We told our parents. It was hard for my mum. There was one midwife in the system who was OK with us I think the rest were afraid. She would call when we were due an appointment and I’d say, “No thanks, we’re fine. ” But my pregnancy wasn’t a cakewalk. At times I questioned what I’d done. Labour started at 7pm on the Friday and Fox arrived at 1am on Monday 20 February 2017. That weekend was wild and exhausting. I used yoga, meditation, chanting and watched hypnobirthing tutorials on YouTube on the Saturday night. By Sunday, I was weak. That’s the only time we called the midwife. She came over twice, checked me, and both times said, “Keep going” and left. I chose never to use the word “pain” but “sensation”. If I had let my mind take me to a place of pain I think I’d have lost my shit. My water broke at 10pm on Sunday. Flynn and Claire thought it was hilarious that I   my hair I wanted to look good for my baby girl. By now, I was making primal noises and I couldn’t get any respite from the pain. As the birth approached, I took myself and Flynn to the darkness of the bathroom. I crouched and entered this wave of sensation, and she came so quickly just flipped out like a fish. I thought she would be calm but her cry was loud. She was so slippery  —   between four hands we could barely catch her but, together, we did and laid her on my thighs, then I fed her. It was both   and  . I felt like a warrior woman. We waited two hours until the cord stopped pulsing, then Flynn cut it with a scalpel. Afterwards, when I was confident enough to share, I put pictures of labour and the placenta on my Instagram page which I describe as radicalising motherhood encouraging other women to own their journeys. A midwife came the next day and weighed and measured her. I’m OK with that it was fun. She’s already had eye drops, so I’m not against giving her medicine. If we had the money, we might have hired a private midwife who could support us without being constrained by the system, but I’d do everything the same way again. My mum says what I accomplished was miraculous. To me, it felt like the only way the way women always did it and many cultures still do. We call it free birth, but other women just call it birth. • As told to Deborah Linton, Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian. com",-0.5
"Iran nuclear chief warns US over support for Saudi Arabia. The head of Iran’s atomic energy organisation, one of the architects of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, has warned the US to stop upsetting the regional balance of power by siding with Saudi Arabia. Writing in the Guardian, Ali Akbar Salehi said “lavish arms purchases” by regional actors  —   a reference to the Saudi purchase of $100bn of US arms during Donald Trump’s recent visit to Riyadh  —   would be seen as provocative in Tehran and that it would be unrealistic to expect Iran to remain “indifferent”.  Salehi, an MIT graduate scientist who has also served as foreign minister, was the second most senior Iranian negotiator, dealing with technical aspects, during nearly two years of talks between Tehran and six of the world’s major powers that led to the final nuclear accord in Vienna in July 2015. Although Trump has promised to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran” he has not so far taken any concrete steps to scrap it. Last month, two days before Iran’s presidential election, his administration announced that it was continuing to waive   sanctions under the agreement despite Washington toughening up its overall Iran policy.  Salehi said it was possible to rescue the deal’s engagement if it was met with reciprocal gestures. “Often following   engagement, some western nations, whether distracted by   political motivations or the lucrative inducements of regional actors, walk away and allow the whole situation to return to the status quo ante,” wrote Salehi, who is also a   of Iran. Salehi warned of “chaotic behaviour” and “further tension and conflict” if the other side disregarded Iran’s security concerns, failed to adhere to its commitments and insisted on what he called alternative facts including ideas such as the “clash of civilisations” “  conflict” “  enmity” and the “  axis against Iran”.  His article comes at a time of simmering tensions in the Middle East, where relations between Tehran and Riyadh, which are on opposite sides of many regional conflicts such as the wars in Syria and Yemen, have deteriorated.  Trump’s first   foreign trip to Riyadh tilted the regional balance, and contributed in part to the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies, who have accused the tiny emirate of funding terrorists and appeasing Iran. Meanwhile, in Syria,   militias and a coalition of forces led by Washington have collided a number of times in recent weeks while fighting Islamic State.  “Stoking Iranophobia” or failure to deliver on promises under the deal would jeopardise engagement, Salehi wrote. “We would all end up back at square one,” he cautioned. “Unfortunately, as things stand at the moment in the region, reaching a new state of equilibrium might simply be beyond reach for the foreseeable future. ” Salehi urged the outside world to take heed of the results of last month’s Iranian presidential election and the message Iranians sent, but he said “engagement is simply not a   street and we cannot go it alone”.

I closed my medical practice and drove him all over East Texas to meet community leaders, meet with newspapers and hold campaign events. We agree on most issues. He is one of the hardest working members of Congress. His relationship with his constituency is great. His “midnight tours” of the Capitol are legendary. He probably knows more about the U.S. Capitol building, its history and its artwork and furnishings than anyone, possibly including the Capitol Architect.   He remains one of the poorest members of Congress – good evidence that he is not trying to profit from his position. I have stood by him when he has made innumerable controversial statements that get him more “face time” on Fox News than Bill O’Reilly. I supported his excuse that being flamboyant and controversial was the only way a back bencher like him could effectively articulate his message and get it out to a wide audience. He is a member of the Freedom Caucus — the farthest right group in the Republican Caucus in Washington.

"Why engineers are looking to animals for new technology – TechCrunch. As a race, human beings have a lot of shortcomings. We’re not very fast, not all that strong and while we have been able to create technology that helps us overcome our environments, we’re not very good at adapting to them. Animals, on the other hand, have been successfully adapting and evolving to meet the world’s challenges long before we were stumbling around. While it might be too late for us to learn these lessons ourselves from our animal counterparts, it’s not too late to pass them on to our inventions. And biomimetic and bio-inspired labs across the world are doing just that. “If you think about mobility technology in the engineering world, we have airplanes in the air, ships in the water, but none of these technologies are available without our artificial modification of the environment,” Dr. Sangbae Kim, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and director of the university’s Biomimetic Robotics Laboratory, told TechCrunch. “Animals have evolved to be the best at mobility, because, for most of them, it’s critical for survival.” Crafting technology to mimic nature is nothing new, Kim says. From developing aerodynamic technology to small conveniences like Velcro, humans have been taking a cue from the natural world for as long as we’ve been inventing. The field of engineering, says Kim, has this kind of inspiration as an intrinsic feature and it will be crucial to solving problems such as disaster reconnaissance, labor and even elderly care. “This is technology we must have,” says Kim. “Not just something cool to have.” With new technological developments, this kind of inspired design has gone far beyond Velcro in recent years. A prodigy of Kim’s lab, the Cheetah 3 is a 90 pound rescue robot designed to traverse terrain that is dangerous or inaccessible to humans (e.g. power plant inspection of natural disaster reconnaissance) with cat-like reflexes and motion. Its predecessors have been able to make autonomous running leaps over obstacles in their path (granted, at a considerably slower speed than its namesake) and Cheetah 3 has the added functionality to complete all these tasks while blind. By not relying on its sensors and cameras, Cheetah 3 is designed to have a better intuitive knowledge of its environment and perform in scenarios that are either too dark or “noisy” (too visually stimulating.) Natural inspiration is not only found in robotics, but in material engineering as well. In 2002, Dr. Anthony Brennan, a material science and engineering professor at the University of Florida, was participating in Naval research to design strategies to keep vessels from growing algae and barnacles on their sides. While exploring the question, Brennan discovered that sharks — who spend their lives slowly moving through water — had answered it long ago. Examining the patterns in a shark’s scales, Brennan discovered that the unique ribbed, diamond structure of the shark’s scales discouraged microorganisms from settling on the surface. Taking this discovery beyond naval ships, Brennan founded the company Sharklet in 2007 to design medical instruments built with this topology and create a non-toxic antibiotic alternative to harsh chemical cleaners. Out of Case Western Reserve University’s Biologically Inspired Robotics lab, this creepy-crawly bot is helping both roboticists and neuroscientists better understand a type of motion called peristalsis — or movement through contracting and expanding of muscle. While this kind of movement is not unique to earth-worms (humans, in fact, do it when swallowing), the ability to propel and maneuver their bodies through tight spaces with it is. To study this motion, the lab created the CMMWorm (Compliant Modular Mesh Worm) — a soft robot with a Lego-like capability to have segments detached and rearranged. Researchers told Gizmodo that they hope this kind of soft robot could be useful in situations as small as medical endoscopies and as large as investigating blocked pipes. And who could forget, man’s best friend, Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini. This electric robot weighs about 66 pounds, stands at just under three feet tall and can last for 90 minutes on just one charge. At TC Sessions: Robotics held at UC Berkeley this summer Boston Dynamics announced its plans to move SpotMini into pre-production and begin selling the bot in 2019 — marking the first move toward commercialization for the company. Boston Dynamics says that SpotMini would fit well into a home or office space, but doing what exactly is still a little unclear.

"Nevada wildfire destroys 22 homes.  (CNN) More than 1, 000 firefighters are battling to contain a wildfire in western Nevada that has burned about 3, 400 acres since Friday and remains 20% contained. The Little Valley Fire near Lake Tahoe has destroyed 22 homes and more than a dozen outbuildings, local officials said.   Firefighters struggled with the blaze that began Friday morning as later that night, wind gusts hit up to 87 mph. Four injuries from smoke inhalation were reported on the first day of the blaze. ”Can you imagine trying to put a fire out in the middle of a hurricane without the rain and a fire in your face? That’s about as scary as it gets,” fire information officer Mark Struble told CNN on Saturday. But he said the fire could have been a lot worse. ”We got a little rain, about a third of an inch, which really helped slow it down.”  Heavy rainfall is expected Sunday, but it could also trigger debris flow and rock falls in the burned areas, according to local authorities.  Wind could blow sparks, Struble said the wind expected Saturday would blow the fire in on itself, which would help. But he expressed concern the wind could blow sparks that would send the blaze racing into another direction.  He said firefighters worked all night to dig around the fire line. ”The fire has moderated. Most of the smoke is from the interior of the burn from the big trees,” he said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The Nevada Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said 500 structures were threatened, CNN affiliate   in Reno reported earlier. Governor declares state of emergency, Some evacuations are in effect, and Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval has declared a state of emergency in the area.   ”Declaring a State of Emergency allows us to increase capacity and resources to manage the fires,” Washoe County Assistant County Manager Kevin Schiller said in a statement.  ”We thank our emergency responders who are working hard to protect citizens. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by these fires.”   The fire is burning on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, west of Washoe Lake. It was one of three in the area Friday, officials said.",-1.0
"Does Egypt’s Law Protect ’Short-Term Brides’ Or Formalize Trafficking?. Egypt has an unusual law known as the ”seasonal marriage” law, and the government says it’s aimed at helping the many poor families who resort to selling their daughters into temporary or   marriages with wealthy, older foreign men to support themselves. Egypt’s Justice Ministry says it will begin strictly enforcing that law, which requires foreign men  —   usually from Gulf countries  —   to pay to marry women 25 years or more their junior. And it’s increasing the amount the men must pay. All this, it says, is to protect Egyptian women. Human rights groups say the law formalizes sex trafficking and bolsters a business that preys on the poor and the vulnerable. People like Hind. Hind is 27 years old. She is ashamed. And because of that, she asks me to use only her first name when she recounts her story. Two years ago, a marriage broker came to the   apartment that she, her four sisters, her invalid father and her ailing mother shared. Hind worked different jobs, mostly in retail, to support them all on less than $100 a month. Hind says the broker spoke to her father. After he left, her father explained that there was a    Saudi man who wanted to marry a young Egyptian woman. He’d pay about $2, 000 to marry Hind for two months while he was visiting Egypt. Her father said, ”Hind, you see the life that we’re living and what this money will do for us,” she recalls. ”I said, ’OK, I will do it.’ ” Her mother pleaded with her not to. Hind’s mother said she’d rather beg than sell her daughter. But Hind thought the money could go to medicine for her sick mom and to help her sisters. She quickly realized she’d made a mistake. ”I was disgusted by him. I was with a man older than my father,” she says. ”But it didn’t matter. I’d already sold myself, sacrificed myself to rescue my family.” She cries often during our conversation. A few weeks after the marriage, her mother died  —   of sadness, Hind believes. When the   two months were over, she moved back in with her family. Now they’re in a slightly bigger apartment in a new neighborhood, where people won’t know her story. ”I was an innocent girl who believed in love and marriage,” Hind says. ”Now I hate the word ’marriage.’ ” She wishes her parents had thought before having so many children with so little money to support them. She wishes there were a welfare system in the state to help people like her family. She wishes she could’ve made a different decision. Last month, when Egypt’s justice minister said authorities would start strictly enforcing the law, it increased the amount from about $5, 100 to the equivalent of just under $6, 400, to be invested in an Egyptian bank in the woman’s name. The law originally banned marriages between foreign men and women who were 25 years or more younger unless special exceptions were made. But in 1993 the government began requiring foreign men to pay for the right to marry much younger Egyptian women. Over the years the amount has increased and so has the practice. And while there are no hard numbers on how many Egyptian women are married off to much older foreign men, human rights groups say it’s a thriving business, and in parts of the country, whole villages resort to selling their daughters to support the family. Although it’s billed as protective, rights advocates say this is helping the practice thrive. The money formalizes sex trafficking and forced marriages, they say. ”It is an industry, especially in the north of the country, whereby you have kind of tourism marriage,” said Amr Abdel Rahman, a researcher at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. What he calls ”tourism marriage” is basically sex trafficking. Older men, usually from wealthy Arab Gulf countries, typically with wives already at home, come to Egypt to buy a wife  —   often temporarily. Sometimes they take them outside the country. The practice peaks in the summer. In a country where more than a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, Abdel Rahman says there are whole villages where poor families sell their daughters simply to keep themselves fed. The amended law will benefit those hired to seek out poor families for the marriages. With the government enforcing the regulation and increasing the amount paid, he says, the brokers’ business will become even more profitable. They’ll get more money, and so will Egyptian banks. ”Those brokers, their business will flourish in light of that decision,” Abdel Rahman says. ”It’s basically making everyone profit without providing any protection to the girls,” he says. ”These girls need medical protection. These girls need a social safety network. These are not there. They were not there before the decision and they will continue being absent after the decision.” One marriage broker whom NPR spoke to says she expects little to change. She asks us not to use her name because she arranges marriages off the books and the men don’t pay the required government fees. Her business is small. She brokers a deal every couple of months. But there are whole offices dedicated to finding young brides for older foreign men, she says. ”I’ve seen fathers force their daughters into the marriages because they have nothing, not even a bed to sleep on,” she says. She does the work for the same reason: to support her family.",-0.5
"Doll: No bear market this year. Bob Doll of Nuveen says it's not likely stocks are heading into a bear market this year. He says it's very much like August when the market was nervous that Chinese authorities did not have a grip on policy and markets were reflecting that. ""If a bear market means the market is going down 20 percent, I don't think we're going to be down 20 percent this year. Could we be down? Yes. But I think it's more likely we will be down modestly, "" he said. In August, the sentiment on China was ""It doesn't know what it's doing. They're having technical issues around the markets.

"VP debate: 11 awkward one-liners, attempted zingers and missed jabs .  (CNN) In the first and only vice presidential debate of 2016, the second fiddles took center stage. Their conversation at times, however, might be described as just a little out of tune.  Both Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine dug in to defend their candidates    often falling over each other to deliver a series of canned zingers and wild jabs. Here are 11 of their most   flat  : 1. Pence flubs name of university  ”Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to    thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.” (The debate took place at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia). 2. Pence on ’ ’ campaign, ”He says ours is an   campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an   campaign?” said Pence, running mate of Donald Trump, who during the debate retweeted insults of Kaine. 3. Kaine struggles with predictable jab, ”You are Donald Trump’s apprentice,” Kaine said clumsily, referencing the television show Trump once starred in. 4. He tried again, ”Do you want a ’you’re hired’ president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ’you’re fired’ president in Donald Trump?” he asked. 5. Pence on Trump’s taxes, Pence defended his running mate’s reported tax return showing $916 million loss in 1995, saying: ”His tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.” 6. Pence’s recycled line, ”There they go again,” he said, ripping off a famous debate line from Ronald Reagan in 1980. 7. Pence’s very specific number of economists, Pence: ”305 economists said your plan is bad for the economy.” 8. Kaine muddles his Miss Universe line  ”Donald Trump can’t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot,” he said. 9. Pence’s topographical assessment of Clinton economic plan, ”We’re going to be in a mountain range of debt (if Clinton wins),” he said. 10. Kaine’s canned line on Trump’s ’Mount Rushmore’ of dictators, ”He’s got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim   Moammar Gadhafi . .. (Pence interrupts) . .. and Saddam Hussein,” he said. 11. Pence responds to a question about homegrown terror . .. by talking about immigration, ”Well, I think it’s    I think it’s a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people,” he said",-1.0
"Uber lands investment from Singapore’s largest taxi operator in blow to rival Grab – TechCrunch. Uber has struck a major deal in Southeast Asia after ComfortDelGro, Singapore’s largest taxi operator, announced [PDF] it has agreed to buy a majority share of the ride-hailing giant’s Singapore-based car rental business. The deal will see a joint venture valued at SG$642 million (US$474 million) established to run Uber’s Lion City Rentals subsidiary in Singapore. Comfort will spend SG$295 million to buy 51 percent in what is the largest investment outlay in its forty-plus-year history. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, but if and when completed it will give Uber exclusive access to Comfort’s fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles in Singapore. That would more than double Uber’s driver numbers in Singapore. While its fleet has decreased over the past year, Comfort — which also operates the CityCab brand — has a dominant share of Singapore’s total of 25,325 taxis. “ComfortDelGro has been in the taxi business for close to five decades and we have seen the industry evolve significantly. Despite the many changes that have taken place, taxis have remained a relevant option for people get around the city. The question many have been asking is: For how long?” ComfortDelGro Chairman Lim Jit Poh said in a statement. “We are confident that taxis will be around for a long time to come. But we are also aware
that the personalised mobility business is a very different one now. By working
together, we feel that we will be able to unleash a lot of synergy which will benefit
consumers and drivers alike,” he added. Uber and Grab compete across seven markets in Southeast Asia, while in Indonesia — Southeast Asia’s largest economy — both are widely thought to be trailing local player Go-Jek, which has grown to command a $1.2 billion valuation from investors like Tencent. Overall, Grab claims two million drivers and more than 70 million app downloads. Uber doesn’t disclose figures for Southeast Asia, but it previously said that Asia Pacific as a whole represents over 20 percent of its global trip volume. The region, it added, has nearly 629,000 active drivers, which it said is over 25 percent of its global driver network. Uber crossed five billion rides worldwide at the end of June 2017, while Grab reached one billion last month. With a population of around five million, Singapore represents a small fraction of Southeast Asia’s 600-million-plus consumers but it is an important and symbolic hub for the region. Comfort, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, announced it was in talks with Uber over a “potential strategic alliance” in August so the tie-in doesn’t come out of the blue. Following that disclosure, however, Uber’s fierce rival Grab began aggressively approaching Comfort drivers with the aim of converting them to its platform. Singapore-based Today suggested that as many as 2,000 drivers were considering jumping ship, but Grab’s efforts haven’t scuppered the deal itself. “As has been reported by the media, both companies are downsizing their fleets and are playing catch up. Grab and our taxi partners have out-innovated them and are in a strong position to grow our fleets, while keeping vehicle rental costs low for driver-partners,” Grab said in a statement to TechCrunch. The deal Comfort is part of a new focus on business development from Uber’s recently appointed Asia Pacific chief Brooks Entwistle. A former Chairman of Goldman Sachs Southeast Asia, Entwistle told TechCrunch in a recent interview that he is focused on doing deals with governments, taxi firms and other entities that would traditionally be more akin to foes than friends of Uber. To that end, Uber has struck deals with taxi firms in Taiwan, it inked its first mobile wallet deal in Southeast Asia with Vietnam’s Momo, and it is looking into the potential to enter the bike sharing space, Entwistle said. The Comfort deal is a major blow to Grab, which is estimated to have built a fleet of around 10,000 licensed drivers in Singapore thanks to partnerships with Singapore’s five other taxi operators and some Comfort drivers who joined independently. (Grab claims over 150,000 drivers across all ride categories in Singapore.) Grab was originally founded in Malaysia but it now counts Singapore as its HQ. It raised $2 billion from SoftBank and China’s Didi Chuxing in July and, while reliable market data is hard to find, most observers believe the firm has edged ahead of Uber in overall marketshare across Southeast Asia. If Uber can hunt down influential alliances like this deal with Comfort in the other six markets where it rivals Grab in Southeast Asia then the battle is likely to be even more competitive in the future. That’s important given that the region’s ride-sharing economy is tipped to grow five-fold to reach $13.1 billion in annual revenue and 29 million customers over the next decade.

"Brazilian jaguar’s killing prompts calls for curbs on use of wild animals. Animal welfare groups in Brazil have called for restrictions on the showcasing of   animals following the lethal shooting of a jaguar that escaped its handlers after an Olympic torch ceremony in the Brazilian Amazon. The    female  —   which had been given the name Juma  —   was killed at a zoo in Manaus attached to a military training centre where the Olympic event took place. The jungle cat  —   which is on the list of   species  —   was supposed to have been tranquillised, but freed itself from its shackles and approached a soldier who killed it with a single shot. The military  —   which operates the zoo where Juma was kept  —   said the killing was necessary to protect the team that was trying to recapture her. But the death has stirred up a furious reaction on social networks and among animal rights campaigners. Conservation groups condemned the incident and said wild creatures should not be used to glorify the military, the Olympics or any human activity. “It should not have been at the event. I don’t think the jaguar is a good mascot, especially like this  —   chained up, like a trophy on display,” said Carlos Durigan, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Brazil. He said it was fundamentally wrong to cage a large predator that would normally roam over hundreds of square kilometres.  Similar outrage was expressed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. “When will we learn? Wild animals held captive and forced to do things that are frightening, sometimes painful, and always unnatural are ticking time bombs  —   our actions put them and humans at risk,” the group’s director Brittany Peet, said in a statement. The slaughter of a jaguar  —   which is the mascot of the Brazilian Olympic team  —   is the latest in a long list of bad news for the organisers of Rio 2016, South America’s first Games. It follows a Zika epidemic, pollution concerns, infrastructure collapses and comes amid the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and the worst recession in decades. “We made a mistake in permitting the Olympic torch, a symbol of peace and unity, to be exhibited alongside a chained wild animal. This image goes against our beliefs and our values,” the local Rio 2016 organising committee said in a public apology. “We guarantee that there will be no more such incidents at Rio 2016. ” Ipaam, the Amazonas state government authority that oversees the use of wild animals, confirmed it had received a request for authorisation for Juma to be present at the torch event. It denied that all captivity was wrong, noting that in many cases animals are rescued after their mothers are killed and that zoos can help in research and conservation. It is investigating the shooting.",-0.5
"Why Trump and the Tech Industry Are on a Collision Course. The political gulf between Donald Trump and the   community he has summoned to a meeting in New York City on Wednesday might be comparable to the technological distance between the latest   smartphone and a Commodore 64 personal computer. While Hillary Clinton, by most accounts, did not stir up as much enthusiasm as President Obama did among this group, the resistance to Trump across the technology industry was widespread and powerful —  whether measured by votes, campaign contributions, or endorsements. The list of   notables who endorsed Trump essentially began and ended with Peter Thiel, the PayPal   and libertarian investor who also bankrolled the lawsuit from wrestler Hulk Hogan that bankrupted Gawker Media. Democrats: Trump Must Divest From His Hotel or Breach His Lease, The barriers between Trump and the technology world span both values —  the industry emphatically leans left on social issues —  and interests. Trump’s hostility to immigration, opposition to free trade, and resistance to replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources to combat climate change all clash directly with the constellation of technology industries that rely on importing talent from around the world, sell their products across the globe, and have invested heavily in developing   alternatives to oil, gas, and coal. Tech leaders are also bracing for Trump to attempt to unravel the   rules that Obama’s Federal Communications Commission adopted, and to push against the privacy standards many industry leaders have sought to maintain. During the campaign, Trump in turn lashed Apple for manufacturing too many of its products overseas. Stephen Bannon, the former chief executive of Breitbart —  who has emerged as the ideological synthesizer of Trump’s worldview —  has touted Democrats’ courtship of the technology industry as evidence the party had abandoned heartland workers for coastal elites. As Bannon recently told The Hollywood Reporter, “They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It’s not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about. ” Trump and most leaders in the tech community start from an inimical view of what makes the economy prosper. While Trump presents the economy essentially as a   competition —  with immigrants and foreign trading competitors in effect taking opportunities from   Americans —  the tech industry’s dominant view is that more openness to ideas, people, products, and markets ultimately creates a widening circle of growth. The technology giants face their own questions about inclusion of racial minorities and women, and whether, as Bannon questioned, their   products are generating good jobs for the many or just wealth for a few. But they are virtually united in believing that Trump is trying to restore an economic order that is irretrievably past. Trump “holds a totally antithetical worldview to most people there,” said a political operative who works closely with technology companies and who asked not to be identified. “That’s not to say he is entirely wrong and they are entirely right. But he is the personification of the mythical past. Basically from 1947 until 1965, during that period of time, things were pretty sweet if you were a white, straight,    guy.   …     It felt dominant and it was. But [among technology leaders] there is a very strong belief that we are not going back to the economy the way it was. There is definitely a belief that is not going to happen, and that it is not going to look and feel like it did. ” Across this DMZ of mutual suspicion, financial support for Trump from the technology industry barely registered as trace amounts. The industry is usually thought of as leaning left, but even compared with Mitt Romney’s fundraising among techies in 2012, Trump’s cratered. The Center for Responsive Politics, on its authoritative OpenSecrets. org website, tracks contributions from individuals and political action committees from all major industry sectors. Among the companies the Center includes in the Internet sector —  firms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon —  Clinton and the super PACs supporting her outraised Trump and his affiliated PACs through  . Clinton’s haul was far greater: $5. 6 million compared with just $54, 472 for Trump. (Final figures through Election Day aren’t available yet.) That’s an advantage of nearly 103 to 1. Four years ago, Obama’s advantage over Romney among these firms was much more modest, at just under 3 to 1. In the Center’s larger grouping of firms involved in electronics manufacturing and equipment —  companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, and Oracle —  Clinton outraised Trump by about 22 to 1: $10. 7 million to $483, 313. In 2012, the Center’s figures show, Romney and his affiliated PACs actually outraised Obama and his allies among these firms, $8. 6 million to $8. 3 million. That means even Romney outraised Trump from these companies by nearly 18 to 1. Individuals from firms identified in the   industry gave the Clinton campaign about $1. 1 million —  and Trump less than $46, 000. Romney, a former investor himself at Bain Capital, also outraised Obama among venture capitalists. The striking things about these numbers is not the level of support for Clinton very few technology executives made the massive personal donations to political action committees supporting her that she received from wealthy executives and entrepreneurs in some other sectors. Instead, the notable point is the minuscule support for Trump, who not only faced policy conflicts with tech leaders, but was also hampered by his almost complete lack of personal relationships with them. Among both the internet and electronics manufacturing and equipment firms, Trump was significantly outraised not only by Clinton, but also by Republican primary rivals Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Jeb Bush —  all of whom obviously stopped collecting money long before Trump did. In the increasingly dispersed geographic clusters of technology manufacturing and digital design, the voting results were nearly as lopsided. Looking at the results by county, Clinton won about   of the vote in San Francisco and Kings County (Brooklyn) about   in San Mateo (Silicon Valley) and Denver and just under   in Suffolk (Boston) Multnomah (Portland) Santa Clara (Silicon Valley) and King (Seattle). She won almost exactly   of the vote in Travis County (Austin). One of few emerging technology nodes that Trump carried was Maricopa County (Phoenix) where the staunchly conservative and older eastern suburbs tipped the balance. An analysis of the election results by metropolitan area —  rather than by county —  that was conducted by my colleague Richard Florida and his associates at the Martin Prosperity Institute adds to the picture. Florida and his colleagues found that in a regression analysis designed to isolate the impact of different social and economic factors on the results, “Clinton support was   …     much greater in metros with larger concentrations of     investment, and   industry, while Trump votes were negatively correlated with each. These correlations are all stronger for 2016 than they were in 2012. ” In fact, subsequent analysis by Florida and his associates, conducted for The Atlantic, found that Clinton carried 18 of the 20 metropolitan areas with the highest amount of   investment. The only exceptions were the Dallas and Houston metro areas —  though in each case Clinton comfortably won the county directly centered on the city itself. The 18   metropolitan areas that Clinton carried —  a list topped by San Francisco San Jose Boston New York Los Angeles Washington, D. C. San Diego and Seattle —  collectively account for over 85 percent of the nation’s total   investment. In all these ways, the   industries accustomed to thinking of themselves as visionaries shaping an increasingly digital, globalized, and green economic future expressed their resistance to Trump —  a presidential candidate who, in his pledge to “make America great again,” chose as his model a   century economy that relied more on manufacturing and   extraction, and less on immigrants and imports, than today’s economy does. Trump, for his part, may see the socially liberal,   tech community as an ideal foil: a prominent industry he can confront for his   largely   base with very little risk, because he has so little support in it to lose. Wednesday’s meeting will offer the first indication of how these clashing perspectives will converge —  or, more likely, collide —  over the next four years.

"Oops: ’Superhenge’ actually had no stones.  ”The response from the radar was so good that the team thought they were dealing with a whole series of stones lying on their side” at Durrington Walls, archaeologist Nicola Snashall tells the BBC.  But when the team finally got down to excavating two of the pits, they instead found ”enormous pits for timber posts.” The large beams of wood appear to have been removed not long after they were sunk into the post holes some 4, 500 years ago, reports Vice.  The Independent puts numbers to what it calls Britain’s ”largest ancient monument of its type,” reporting that as many as 300 timbers measuring up to 23 feet long were vertically lifted from the holes making up what was a    circle.  After the wood was removed, ”the top was then filled in with chalk rubble and then the giant henge bank was raised over the top,” explains Snashall.  Researchers are still baffled by what the timber was for and why it was removed before the monument was even finished, but ”for some strange reason” it clearly was, says Snashall.

"Is Education Tied To Conspiracy Theory Belief?. Debunked conspiracy theories have been making the rounds on social media lately, from the thoroughly unsupported claim that millions of people voted illegally in California to false assertions about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations. Conspiracy theories, which typically involve one or more powerful agents secretly manipulating world events, are accepted by a large proportion of Americans. One analysis of four nationally representative surveys found that half of respondents endorsed at least one conspiracy theory, such as the claim that Barack Obama was born outside the United States or that the financial crisis was deliberately orchestrated by a group of Wall Street bankers. Because conspiracy theories can influence people’s attitudes towards individuals, social groups, institutions and policies, they’re often of interest to those tracking public opinion and individual behavior. But they’re also of interest to psychologists for what they reveal about the human mind. What makes conspiracy theories compelling to so many people? And why are some people more compelled to believe them than others? Dozens of studies have begun to investigate these questions. Based on these studies, we know that people who believe in one conspiracy theory (say, that JFK was assassinated by the CIA) are also more likely to believe in others (for instance, that the moon landing was faked). In fact, people who endorse some conspiratorial claims (e. g. that Princess Diana faked her own death) are also more likely to endorse inconsistent alternatives (e. g. that Princess Diana was murdered). These findings suggest that in addition to the idiosyncratic factors that figure into people’s reasoning about each unique conspiracy theory, there are more general characteristics about some individuals or their environment that make them more or less inclined towards conspiratorial thinking. What might these more general characteristics be? Among other things, studies find that people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories if they feel alienated, powerless and disadvantaged, and if they are distrustful of others. Conspiratorial thinking is also associated with narcissism, rejection of climate science, and an individual’s own willingness to participate in conspiracies. Additionally, a variety of demographic factors have been found to predict conspiratorial thinking, including low levels of education. These patterns of association are informative, but they’re often difficult to interpret. For example, is it the case that education reduces belief in conspiracy theories, or that people who endorse conspiracy theories are less likely to pursue formal education? Moving from correlation to causation is difficult in such cases because a true experiment  —   in which, for example, people are randomly assigned to education levels  —   can be impossible, impractical or unethical. Despite these challenges, two new papers shed light on the connection between education and conspiratorial thinking. They do so not by manipulating education experimentally, but by testing hypotheses about why and how education could affect belief in conspiracy theories. Specifically, the papers identify factors that mediate the relationship between education and conspiratorial thinking. The first paper, authored by psychologist Karen Douglas and colleagues, was published earlier this year in the journal Thinking  Reasoning. It reports evidence that one factor mediating the relationship between lower education and conspiratorial thinking is the tendency to attribute agency and intentionality where it doesn’t belong. In two studies with more 500 participants who completed an online survey, people reported the extent to which they thought nonhuman animals (such as fish) natural entities (such as the ocean) and technological devices (such as televisions) possess attributes that are often restricted to humans, such as having intentions and free will. Those with higher education were less likely to extend these attributes beyond humans, while those who believed in conspiracy theories were more likely to do so. Most importantly, the relationship between education and conspiratorial beliefs could be explained in part by the association between each of these factors and the tendency to ascribe human attributes to  . This suggests that education reduces   of agency and intentionality, and that this reduction decreases the appeal of conspiracy theories, which often posit one or more agents behind a constellation of potentially unrelated events. The second paper, authored by psychologist   van Prooijen and forthcoming in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, finds support for two additional mediating factors: skepticism towards the idea that complex problems can have simple solutions, and greater feelings of control. Across two samples of Dutch participants (one including 4, 062 readers of a Dutch popular science magazine and the second a group of 1, 251 adults selected to be representative of the Dutch population) participants with higher levels of education were more likely to disagree with statements suggesting simple solutions to complex problems, such as: ”With the right policies, most problems in society are easy to solve.” Participants with higher levels of education also felt that they had greater control over their political environment  —   they were less likely to report feeling powerless when watching how events unfold in the news, and more likely to agree with a statement such as: ”Citizens can influence government decisions” or ”It is possible to object against government decisions.” Most importantly, both of these factors also predicted skepticism towards conspiracy theories, with further analyses suggesting that the association between education and conspiratorial thinking was mediated by both of these factors. While these papers fall short of establishing a causal connection between education and skepticism towards conspiracy theories, they point to the idea that education brings with it a suite of cognitive and affective consequences, and that these consequences can disrupt the processes that draw people towards conspiratorial beliefs in the first place. Moreover, they suggest that one of these cognitive consequences is a shift away from relatively intuitive and automatic processes  —   of the kind that support simple, intentional narratives  —   in favor of more deliberative, analytic thinking. In fact, the causal link between analytic thinking and greater rejection of conspiracy theories is the one piece of the story that does have direct experimental support: A paper published in 2014 found that having people complete a task that increased analytic thinking in the short term led them to report lower belief in conspiracy theories when asked immediately after. Education could be a way to generate similar but   effects. Not all conspiracy theories are harmful. Some might promote a healthy skepticism, and some might even be true. But many do have negative personal and political consequences. For these reasons alone, it makes sense to track how and why conspiracy theories arise and gain traction. Yet blaming errant tweets or other forms of social media is just one part of the picture. The real culprit is the human mind  —   the machinery that generates conspiratorial narratives in the first place, and that guides each subsequent tweet, share, and like.

"Schumer: House repeal bill is 'Trumpcare' | TheHill.

""Trumpcare will make health insurance in America measurably worse in just about every way and likely leave more Americans uninsured,"" he said. Republicans quickly labeled former President Obama's 2009 healthcare bill as ""ObamaCare,"" part of their strategy to link Democrats and the president to the legislation. House Republicans rolled out their proposal to repeal ObamaCare Monday night, earning opposition from Democrats and, increasingly, conservative Republicans opposed to tax credits included in the plan. Schumer argued that ""Trumpcare"" will increase the cost of insurance, lower taxes on the wealthy and negatively impact women's health by cutting off federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  ""With respect to women, Trumpcare would send us back to the Dark Ages,"" Schumer added. ""The bill is a winning lottery ticket for wealthy Americans – it removes an investment tax and a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans.""  The House proposal dismantles the core provisions of ­ObamaCare, including its subsidies to help people buy coverage, expansion of Medicaid, taxes and mandates for people to have insurance. It would also cut off Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding.   House lawmakers are hoping to clear the bill through committee this week, a timeline that Schumer signaled was too fast. ""After years of howling at the moon about Democrats rushing through the Affordable Care Act ... Republicans are having committee votes two days after the bill is released,"" he added.  The Senate is eyeing voting on the repeal bill by early April, though top GOP lawmakers haven't ruled out needing to amend the House legislation.

But in the past several decades, the children and grandchildren of that first wave of Cuban exiles, known as   have settled in many U. S. cities. And like their fellow urban residents, they have voted more for Democrats. “Big story, Cubans endorsed me,” Trump said Saturday in Tampa, referring to an endorsement recently in Miami from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association, a group of retired U. S. military members that in 1961 launched a failed attack on the Cuban bay. Trump also stopped the rally to hold up a sign that read: “Cuban Women for Trump” and said, “I love all of these signs. ” Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, are in a tight race in Florida and in the handful of other battleground states that on Tuesday will decide their White House contest. See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → Clinton and other Democrats have for decades held the minority vote, largely black and Hispanic residents. But Trump, a   candidate, like other Republican presidential nominees before him, has tried desperately to appeal to both voting blocs in an effort to upset Clinton, who has led from the start of the race. A new Fox News national poll shows Clinton leading Trump by 2 percentage points,    percent. Obama this spring used his Executive Office powers to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in an attempt to “normalize relations” with Cuba, which means opening up more trade and tourism between the countries to put an end to their Cold   standoff. However, Republican leaders largely disagreed with the president’s move, particularly over continuing human rights violations, but failed to block it. Early voting so far in the   race among Hispanics, a voting bloc in which   are typically included, suggests strong support for Clinton. However, early voting among blacks appears significantly lower for Clinton, compared to the historical levels for Obama, the county’s first   president. Clinton, in her effort to win over the Hispanic vote in Florida, Nevada and even   Arizona, has tried to portray Trump as opposed to almost all immigrants. “If you are Latino, you know what life would be like because we’d have a president who doesn’t see you as American,” Clinton said Thursday in Las Vegas. On Friday, Pence said Miami that Obama    “with Clinton’s support”      the U. S. embassy in Havana and suggested that the president, if possible, would have lifted the entire trade embargo on Cuba. “Well let me make you a promise: When Donald Trump is president of the United States, we will repeal Obama’s executive orders on Cuba,” Pence said.  “We will support continuing the embargo until real political and religious freedoms are a reality for all the people of Cuba. Donald Trump will stand with   Cubans in the fight against Communist oppression. ”       ",1.0
"GOP Hopes Rise In Battle For The Senate, But Democrats Still Have The Edge. Republicans are feeling the best they have this cycle about their chances of holding their majority in the U. S. Senate, but doing that would require several states to break their way on election night. That’s a risky place to be one day before control of the Senate is decided. The tightening of the presidential race over the past week may have had an impact on these Senate contests. Most of the contests remain firm   though Democrats still have multiple paths to winning back the five seats they need (or just four if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the presidency). Illinois is all but assured of being in the Democrats’ column, but it is the only seemingly sure thing. Former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold’s lead in Wisconsin has shrunk in the closing days, and both parties are spending anew. Republicans, though, privately say they would be shocked if it broke their way. The next two most likely to flip, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, depend so much on the presidential race. Both are tight, but Democrats might have the edge because of a superior turnout operation. Weak GOP incumbents in Missouri and North Carolina continue to give Democrats an    edge, but in Missouri especially, the conservative lean of the state is certainly helping Republicans. North Carolina will also likely track closely to the presidential results in the battleground state. Perhaps the biggest shift over the past week has been in Indiana. Former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh hasn’t had a cakewalk since he jumped into the race in July. His advantage here is gone, while Republicans are increasingly optimistic. And it’s another state that’s likely Republican in the presidential race. Nevada, the lone GOP offensive opportunity, has sunk on the list of most likely to flip control, with early voting in the state signaling heavy Democratic and Hispanic turnout. Still, if Democrats do take back control of the Senate, it will be by a much slimmer margin than they had hoped for weeks earlier. And if it’s a   majority, get ready for another fight in a year if Clinton does become president. That’s because Vice President Tim Kaine’s Senate seat in Virginia will come open in 2017, and it would become the focus of a very competitive special election. Even if Republicans lose the majority, they would have every incentive to delay and not go along with major legislation. Why? The 2018 Senate map is a minefield for Democrats. Expect some late calls across the board. And at least one race, possibly two, may go into overtime. The open Louisiana race won’t be decided until a Dec. 10 runoff, because Tuesday is actually the   primary. And if Georgia GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson falls below 50 percent, he’ll be forced into a Jan. 10 runoff. Both, however, won’t decide the Senate, as they should stay in Republican hands. Here’s our final ranking of the vulnerable Senate races, from most to least likely to change party hands: 1. Illinois (  Kirk) Previous rank: 1, This one was baked a long time ago, and Kirk’s downward spiral in the closing weeks certainly didn’t help. No suspense here  —   Democrats start out at least a net one for the night with Rep. Tammy Duckworth poised to become the state’s next senator. 2. Wisconsin (  Johnson) Previous rank: 2, It would be a pleasant surprise for Republicans if Johnson did hang on here in his rematch with former Democratic Rep. Russ Feingold. Final polling in the state showed this one was    and spending from both sides has proven that. But Democrats view the   investments as an insurance policy  —   you don’t want to look back and regret not having done what it takes. If Johnson does pull what would be an upset here, it’s going to be a very long night for Democrats. 3. Pennsylvania (  Toomey) Previous rank: 3, Clinton is favored in the Keystone State, but the margin may decide whether she takes Democratic nominee Katie McGinty with her. Toomey has pulled out all the final stops at the end, and his closing ad even quoted President Obama praising him for his work on   legislation. But that tactic drew a sharp statement from the White House. Of the   states, though, Democrats feel best about this one while Republicans don’t. 4. New Hampshire (  Ayotte) Previous rank: 6, The Granite State is tight across the board, but when you factor in Democrats’     operation, and the fact that late deciders typically break their way here, it might be good news for Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Still, this one could go either way. 5. Missouri (  Blunt) Previous rank: 4, This race had to be a perfect storm for Democrats to even have a chance, and that has happened. Blunt is viewed as the ultimate insider, and he hasn’t taken his challenge from Secretary of State Jason Kander seriously enough. Kander, a war veteran, was an early, solid recruit. Still, the Republican lean of the state is showing up in polls. If Blunt is able to win, it will be Trump who carries him across the finish line  —   the opposite of most of the other races on here. 6. North Carolina (  Burr) Previous rank: 7, Burr has been another underwhelming incumbent, but former state Rep. Deborah Ross has taken plenty of hits from Republicans over her tenure as head of the state’s ACLU. Burr has also had some     moments that are adding to the GOP’s headache here. As the presidential race goes, so likely goes this Tar Heel State contest. 7. Indiana (Open,   Coats is retiring) Previous rank: 5, No candidate has seen his stock fall as far and as fast as former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh did this year. His late entry into the race this summer was heralded as a major   and it was, forcing Republicans to worry about this seat. But his   lead has evaporated, thanks to questions about his residency, lobbyist ties and his final months in office back in 2010. Now, the momentum is all with GOP Rep. Todd Young, who has a slight edge in the final polls. Republicans are increasingly bullish, and with good reason. Trump’s prospects have improved in the Hoosier State as well, which should help Young. 8. Nevada (Open,   Reid) Previous rank: 8, This is the only   seat on this list. Republicans liked the trajectory of this race for months, but the state’s Democratic tilt seems to have won out. An uptick in Hispanic turnout in the early vote, fueled by antipathy for Trump, isn’t helping GOP Rep. Joe Heck, who has seesawed back and forth on his party’s controversial presidential nominee. This state is hard to poll, but it almost always underestimates Democrats, particularly Latinos. Some Republicans point out that Sen. Dean Heller was able to win here in 2012 even as Obama carried the state, but his opponent,  . Shelley Berkley, was a poor candidate who was under a House ethics probe. 9. Florida (  Rubio) Previous rank: 9, There may be some Wednesday morning quarterbacking going on if Rubio is able to beat Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy by just a few points. But caution: Results may appear closer than they actually are. Some Democrats have begun finger pointing, saying they are missing a chance to take out a possible 2020 presidential candidate. But Democratic money was likely better spent putting multiple cheaper races into play. This is an incredibly expensive state, and the minute Rubio decided not to retire, he was going to be incredibly hard for Democrats to knock off. Not ranked: Arizona or Ohio, Yes, we’re stopping our rankings with just nine, because those are the only truly competitive races to watch on election night. Clinton playing in Arizona had given Democrats renewed hope they could knock off Sen. John McCain there, but there’s no data to back that up. And Ohio Sen. Rob Portman likely sealed his ticket back to the Senate a long time ago, running maybe the best race of the cycle and putting away his opponent early.",-0.5
"Drought-stricken Southwest considers water desalination.  (CNN) It’s not just California. Droughts are sapping precious water supplies all across America’s southwest. The region has been suffering from drought for 11 of the past 14 years, according to NASA, directly affecting more than 64 million people. In Arizona and Nevada, the water level in Lake Mead    which feeds water to 40 million people across the region    has plummeted to lows not seen since the 1930s, according to the Los Angeles Times. And then there’s Texas    which has been battling its current drought for nearly five years.    weather forecasters predict it could get a lot worse. A NASA study warns that greenhouse gases from fossil fuel emissions might create ”megadroughts” in the western U. S. during the coming decades.  These events could trigger ”events that nobody in the history of the United States has ever had to deal with,” NASA climate scientist Ben Cook says. See a drought map of the United States, Without snow and rainfall, what’s the alternative? Communities in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada are considering more reliance on two sources: ”brackish” or salty water found underground and seawater.  The process is called desalination.  In Texas    which like California, boasts hundreds of miles of ocean shoreline    water levels in some reservoirs are extremely low. Farmers in parts of the state have suspended crop irrigation. Communities have restricted water use. Cities need water to generate energy, and thirst for electricity is skyrocketing. ”There’s 1, 000 people a day moving into Texas and there just won’t be enough water unless we do something about creating new resources,” says Mark Lambert, CEO of a water treatment firm called IDE Americas. In San Diego, Lambert’s company has built the biggest seawater desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere, a $  facility expected to go online as soon as November, producing up to 50 million gallons of freshwater a day by a process called reverse osmosis. Lambert expects the desalination plant to result in a $5 to $7 spike in average monthly water bills. In Florida, a desalination plant in Tampa Bay transforms seawater into as much as 25 million gallons of freshwater daily. That’s 10% of the company’s 2. 3 million customers. About a hundred miles south, Cape Coral, Florida, boast the oldest municipal reverse osmosis desal plant in the nation, dating back to 1977. When it comes to changing seawater to freshwater, Texas is watching.  Texas predicts its population will skyrocket 82% between 2010 and 2060, but its water needs will increase just 22%. The projection factors in declining demand for irrigation and increasing municipal conservation. ”We’ve certainly spent a lot of time looking at what Tampa Bay has done in Florida with their seawater desal project,” says Robert Mace, Texas deputy executive administrator for water, science, and conservation. ”And then we’re certainly looking very closely at that project that San Diego has for water supply.” For years, Texas communities have used desalination plants to purify brackish water from underground. San Antonio    the state’s second most populated city    is building a plant for brackish water set to go online in 2016. But Texas has no major plants that desalinate seawater. Instead of desalination, state water officials are emphasizing conservation, including facilities that transform waste water directly into drinking water.  ”There’s a great deal of potential in reusing water in Texas,” Mace says. The state’s ”direct potable reuse” facilities have been attracting interest from other states, including California, Mace says. But experts acknowledge desalination, especially from seawater, will eventually play a large role.  Building more desalination plants ”probably should have happened a decade ago,” Lambert says.  ”I’m not saying desalination is a silver bullet. It’s a part of the solution.” Environmental groups have been cautiously supportive. When Texas lawmakers hammered out new legislation in March for seawater desalination plants, the Sierra Club’s Ken Kramer told a Texas House committee that each proposed seawater desalination plant should be thoroughly reviewed ”to make sure that it is the most viable approach to meeting a true water supply need and . .. to avoid or minimize the potential effects on marine life and the environment.” A few basic methods for desalination include: Reverse osmosis  This process uses high water pressure. Undrinkable salty or brackish water is pushed at high pressure through a membrane filter. Pure water molecules then exit the other side.  Thermal, This one is all about the heat. When you raise the temperature of the water, it evaporates, leaving the salt behind. The evaporated water condenses in a separate chamber and becomes pure water. Electrolytic, Electricity is the key to this process. Salt in water is made up of atoms called ions that have electrical charges. By sending electricity through salt water and a stack of filters, the process can separate the salt, leaving pure water.  The immediate prospects for Texas seawater desalination are minimal. Next year, a seawater desalination plant is expected to go online in Corpus Christi, Texas. Italian chemical company MG Resins is building its own private desalination facility for manufacturing. It’s expected to pump out 6 million gallons of freshwater a day. There’s also been discussions in communities such as Brownsville and the   area about building seawater desalination plants.  ”Desalting seawater is very expensive compared to other water supplies,” Mace says. ”As other water supplies get allocated or used, seawater desal will probably become more desirable.” Lambert agrees. There ”will be a time in the relative near future when desalinated water becomes the cheapest source of water” as the price of water from other sources rises, he says. Overall, expect the search for new water sources in the southwestern U. S. to be permanent, says Lambert. ”This isn’t a blip on a radar screen.” ",-1.0
"Steph Curry scores 30 as Warriors sweep Jazz to reach conference finals. The Splash Brothers provided the fast start, and the Golden State Warriors made it a quick finish to the second round. They’re four wins from another NBA finals appearance, and so far nobody can slow them down. Stephen Curry scored 30 points and the Warriors completed a   sweep of the Utah Jazz with a   victory Monday night. “We have a lot of talent,” Curry said. “We never know who is going to have a hot night. We try to move the ball, use each other to create open shots and when we do that, the ball is hopping and a lot of good things happen. ” The defending Western Conference champions have won both their series in four games and now await the winner of the   series that is tied at  . The Warriors kept pace with defending champion Cleveland in what has appeared like an inevitable third straight NBA Finals matchup. Both teams are   thus far. “Steph was Steph and we fed off him,” Warriors interim head coach Mike Brown said. Brown said before the game he hoped his team would get out to a fast start and the Warriors did exactly that. Golden State led   at the end of the first quarter after an onslaught from Klay Thompson and Curry. They combined to shoot 6 for 8 in the opening period. Thompson finished with 21, Kevin Durant scored 18 and Draymond Green posted his third career postseason   with 17 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Gordon Hayward led the Jazz with 25 points and Shelvin Mack chipped in with 18. “The most important thing was we imposed our will on the game and we had the game at our pace,” Green said. Curry entered the game averaging 26. 7 points in the playoffs, but Thompson had struggled against the Jazz. That ended Monday. Thompson rebounded from a   effort in game three with    jumpers out the gate. Curry then drained consecutive threes and the rout was on. The Jazz started 3 for 16 from the field as Golden State hit from all areas and finished shooting 57. 1% in the first quarter. Curry picked up right where he left off after an   fourth quarter in game three with a   first quarter. He, Thompson and Green combined for 29 points in that first 12 minutes. The Jazz tried to put off their vacation. They used a   run early in the second quarter, sparked by the suddenly active Dante Exum and Derrick Favors, to cut the lead to 10 points. Utah closed the half with a   run to trail   at halftime, but every time the Jazz made a significant run the rest of the way, the Warriors answered and pushed the lead back to double digits. The Jazz never led Monday and in three of the four games against the Warriors. Utah ended a   playoff drought. Hayward developed into an   and Rudy Gobert became a Defensive Player of the Year candidate. The addition of veterans George Hill, Joe Johnson and Boris Diaw to the young corps of Hayward, Gobert, Favors, Hood and Joe Ingles turned into the team’s first   appearance since 2010. “It’s been a unique arc for us,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “The adversity that kind of continued to rear its head and the way these guys dealt with it.

"Trump: China's effort ""has not worked out"" on North Korea. Several White House officials, including Sean Spicer, stated the Trump administration will continue to put pressure on China in an effort to retaliate against Kim Jong-Un's regime following the death of Otto Warmbier. But the president seemed to dismiss those notions on Twitter Tuesday, writing that their efforts haven't worked out: Why it matters: The Trump administration has looked to China in recent months to ramp up its aggression toward North Korea. But Trump's latest tweet suggests the WH may be switching gears now, and planning to deal with North Korea more directly. A word of caution: Axios' Jonathan Swan writes that it's possible, even likely, that rather than abandoning his previous approach, Trump is publicly shaming Xi for his lack of success in changing North Korea's behavior and giving him one last chance to fix the situation. Timing: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts later this week.",0.0
"Dem vet lawmaker: Senate 'would be wise' to confirm Mattis | TheHill. A Democratic lawmaker who served under retired Gen. James Mattis in the Marines says President-elect Donald Trump is misjudging his pick to be Defense secretary — and he says that’s a good thing. In a Wednesday op-ed for USA Today endorsing the Pentagon chief selection, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) argued Mattis is more than the bravado and bluster Trump finds attractive. “The good news for our country is that Trump has Mattis all wrong,” Moulton wrote. “Before Trump realizes this himself, Democrats would be wise to have this debate and then grant an exemption to confirm him as our next secretary of Defense.” Mattis retired three years ago, so Congress would need to pass a waiver to a law that requires the secretary of Defense be out of uniform for at least seven years before being confirmed for the job. Two Democrats thus far, Sen.

Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), have expressly said they will not vote for a waiver. Other Democrats have not ruled out passing a waiver, but have said the issue deserves careful consideration. Trump has seemed enamored by Mattis’s tough talk and particularly his nickname, “Mad Dog,” saying at Tuesday night’s “thank you” rally in North Carolina that “Mad Dog plays no games, right?” In his op-ed, Moulton relayed the first time he heard Mattis speak, on the eve of invasion of Iraq in 2003. “Standing atop his Humvee, he told us how he planned to duct tape Saddam Hussein to the front of the truck when we got to Baghdad and drive around the city — and we eager young Marines roared with approval,” Moulton said. But Moulton also recalled Mattis’s now-famous letter to his Marines before the invasion that implored them to “engage your brain before you engage your weapon” and reminded them to treat all noncombatants with respect. “He reminded us of the fundamental rights and values for which America stands, and he has never accepted compromising those values even in the brutal pursuit of killing our enemies,” Moulton wrote. Moulton also highlighted Mattis’s comments to Trump that torture does not work and his lack of support for tearing up the Iran nuclear deal.     “When you get to know Mattis, you quickly learn that he is one of the most thoughtful strategic thinkers we have,” Moulton wrote. “Amidst a cabinet that is shaping up to be nearly as unqualified as our new president, including a secretary of Education who has never attended a public school and a Treasury secretary who made millions off foreclosures at the height of the financial crisis, Mattis stands out as a remarkably qualified leader, and I know he is someone who will actually stand up to President TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE.” View the discussion thread.

"Spike in hate crimes prompts special NY police unit.  (CNN) An ”explosion” in hate crimes since Election Day has prompted the creation of a special police unit to fight the uptick in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.  The announcement coincided with an address at Harlem’s Abyssinian Baptist Church, where Cuomo called for an end to the divisiveness that has gripped the country. ”The ugly political discourse of the election did not end on Election Day. In many ways it has gotten worse, [turning] into a social crisis that now challenges our identity as a state and as a nation and our people,” he said.   Donald Trump wasn’t specifically mentioned in his church address, but Cuomo has in the past criticized Trump and vowed in a New York Daily News   that he would ”reject the hateful attitudes that pervaded throughout the 2016 campaign.” The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election.  A   hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomo’s office. Calling this kind of prejudice a ”social poison [in] the fabric of our nation,” the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs. Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind.  The plan, he said, would be to set up a   partnership ”to provide immigrants who can’t afford their own defense the legal assistance they need . .. because in New York, we believe in justice for all,” Cuomo said. He added, ”If there is a move to deport immigrants then I say start with me. I am a son of immigrants. Son of Mario Cuomo, who is the son of Andrea Cuomo, a poor Italian immigrant who came to this country without a job, without money, or resources and he was here only for the promise of America.” Cuomo’s plans also include the expansion of New York’s Human Rights Law to protect students who are bullied or discriminated against. New York Police Department Commissioner James O’Neill told a New York radio station on Sunday he was disturbed by the trends.  ”We’ve had an uptick in hate crimes, actually a little bit more than an uptick. We’re up 31% from last year. We had at this time last year 250, this year we have 328, specifically against the Muslim population in New York City    we went up from 12 to 25, and   is up, too, by 9% from 102 to 111,” O’Neill said.  ”I have no scientific evidence as to why, but you’ve been paying attention to what’s been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it,” O’Neill added.  Cuomo said on Sunday that New York’s tolerance will lead the way for the rest of the nation, and his announcement came as an ” ” rally was held in a Brooklyn park vandalized with swastikas and   graffiti. The rally, at a playground named after the late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, was attended by band member Adam Horovitz, better known as  . ”Keep your eyes open, stand up for each other. This is homegrown terrorism for real,” Horovitz told the crowd. ”I reject Donald Trump’s vision for America. New York City, I’m asking you to do the same.”",-1.0
"Objects From New York’s Buried Past Find a New Home in Midtown - The New York Times. From a   mold used in sugar refining to an oversize oyster, a    spear tip to a   Transferware teapot and a bone from a passenger pigeon, which was once the most abundant bird in North America but was declared extinct in 1914, New York City has cataloged and digitized a vast archive of its buried past. On Wednesday, the Landmarks Preservation Commission is opening the Nan A. Rothschild Research Center, which the commission says is the first municipal archive devoted to a city’s own archaeological collection, a repository in Midtown Manhattan of more than one million artifacts open to researchers and scholars by appointment. A digital archive is already available. In many cases, the objects are portals of discovery into the city’s history, opening hidden doors to untold stories that began  —   or, perhaps, ended  —   with a child’s broken teacup abandoned in Battery Park or a glass seal that identified a wine bottle waiting to be refilled at a local tavern with a family’s favorite vintage. “We’re curating what scholars may want to study and what may be exhibited,” said Amanda Sutphin, the commission’s director of archaeology. The   repository on West 47th Street already contains more than 1, 500 boxes of artifacts from 31 sites that were excavated in all five boroughs. Those sites include the Stadt Huys, now 85 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan, which, in 1979, was the city’s first major historical dig and demonstrated that archaeological treasures might be buried beneath the shallow basements of old buildings. (The Stadt Huys was originally built to relieve William Kieft, the director of what was then known as New Netherland, of the burden of accommodating visitors to his home it later became New Amsterdam’s first City Hall.) That excavation was directed by Nan A. Rothschild, a professor emeritus of anthropology at Barnard College, a member of the faculty of Columbia University, and a cousin of Helena Durst, the chief administrative officer of the Durst Organization, the developer who donated the space for the repository. The repository was named for Dr. Rothschild to honor her contributions to the field. The repository and website are also a collaboration of the Museum of the City of New York the Fund for the City of New York and Iron Mountain, a records and data management company. The digital archive includes images, maps, an education guide and quiz for students, a searchable database, archaeological reports by the landmarks commission and information on which local colleges and universities offer degrees in the field. (A tip for beginners: If you want to sound smart, refer to a piece of broken pottery as a sherd, not a shard.) The repository “contains the city’s material past, although often in fragments,” Dr. Rothschild said. Meenakshi Srinivasan, the commission chairwoman, said, “The everyday objects in the collection reveal what life was like for people who were not documented in the historic record. ” Until they were gathered at the repository, the artifacts were stored at 14 locations, some under reasonably good conditions at Columbia University and Brooklyn College. But some artifacts were unceremoniously stored at a women’s restroom in Van Cortlandt Park. They will now be kept in a   storage area where the contents will be further inventoried. Over time, more will be integrated into the repository, including objects from an excavation at 7 Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan that have been in storage. “These are public projects paid for with public dollars on public land, so the public needs to benefit,” Ms. Sutphin said.",-1.0
" An American Soldier Died Fighting ISIS In Iraq. ’On Sunday evening, people reportedly gathered at Lee’s family home in Bluffton to hang flags.   “Let’s fill this yard with Red, White & Blue,” the post said.’ ’Southwest Georgia Academy, where Lee attended high school, also posted a tribute on Facebook, with old classmates, faculty, and people from his hometown posting their condolences. ’] An American soldier died in Iraq this weekend after a roadside bomb exploded during a security check, according to an announcement from the Pentagon. The Defense Department identifed the soldier Sunday as First Lt. Weston C. Lee of Bluffton, Georgia, a member of the 82nd Airborne Division. He died Saturday after an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated while he was patrolling near Mosul, his division said in a statement. It was the   ’s first deployment. Lee joined the Army in 2015 and became a platoon leader before being deployed to Iraq last December. Lee was in Mosul fighting to eradicate ISIS under Operation Inherent Resolve and to “advise and assist support to partnered forces,” the Department of Defense said in a statement. “1st Lieutenant Wes Lee was an extraordinary young man and officer. He was exactly the type of leader that our Paratroopers deserve,” said Col. Pat Work, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team. Lee was awarded the Bronze Star and Meritorious Service Medal posthumously. “God has gained himself one hell of a soldier,” Lee’s brother, Chester, wrote on Facebook Sunday. “My brother, my friend, Weston Lee died in Iraq yesterday. And I am completely and utterly devastated. Right now I and my family could use your prayers and love. I will miss you Weston but I know right now your telling God whats the next mission. ” “Im so very grateful God gave me the opportunity to know and love this brave young man while I was at SGA,” Jo S. Davis wrote. “I watched with such pride as he accomplished his dream of becoming a Ranger. Weston Lee, you will always be the epitome of a true Warrior. ” Lee is the second American service member to die since the operation to retake Mosul from ISIS began more than six months ago, according to the Associated Press. His death marks the fifth American military fatality in Iraq since the US started fighting ISIS there in 2014. Navy Chief Petty Officer Jason C. Finan, 34, died in October after a roadside bomb went off near Mosul, just days after the fight to reclaim the ISIS stronghold began. Since 2003, 4, 519 US service members have died in Iraq, according to statistics compiled by the website iCasualties. org. In Afghanistan, two American soldiers died last week during an operation against an ISIS affiliate in Nangarhar province. After withdrawing from Iraq in 2011, the US has since bolstered its military presence in the country to help Iraqi forces in the ongoing fight against ISIS. There are now more than 5, 000 US troops in Iraq, according to the Washington Post.  ",-1.0
"World’s heaviest woman flies to India to fight for her life.  (CNN) Eman Ahmed, from Egypt, is believed to be the world’s heaviest woman. According to her family, she weighs 1, 102 pounds (500 kg).  ”Eman didn’t live life as everyone does,” Shaimaa Ahmed, Eman’s younger sister and carer, tells CNN. ”She didn’t enjoy her childhood or youth. She’s been battling with her illness for 36 years.”  According to her family, Eman has barely left her bedroom in over two decades. Unable to move or communicate, she spends her days trapped inside her family home, staring at the ceiling.  A stroke two years ago impaired her speech and mobility, so the last couple of years have been particularly difficult, Eman’s sister says. However, thanks to a social media campaign initiated by Shaimaa, the family’s situation is now looking a little more hopeful.  Publicity surrounding Eman’s plight caught the attention of eminent   surgeon, Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala, who set up a fundraising initiative in order to fly Eman to India.  He plans to set in motion a series of operational procedures that will reduce her weight to below 220 pounds (100kg.) ”She is battling with her life every single day,” Dr. Lakdawala told CNN. He says that as things stand, how long she lives is anybody’s guess.  ”Right now she is like a living bombshell, which could blow up on her any moment.”  According to Guinness World Records, the world’s heaviest living woman is Pauline Potter from the United States, who weighs 643 pounds (291. 6 kg.)  ’She always had hope’ Eman’s family says she’s suffered from thyroid problems since she was a child.  When she was born, she reportedly weighed 11 pounds (5 kg) and by the age of 11, she’d started to put on weight.  By fifth grade she’d stopped going to school because her thyroid problems were making her lethargic.  Her legs were also unable to carry her weight she had to use her knees to move around because she couldn’t stand.  ”She would use her knees to reach the car in the parking lot and we would drive her across Alexandria and the coast without leaving the car,” says her sister Shaimaa.  ”She wasn’t able to walk properly and there was no wheelchair to fit her size.” Despite her tragic circumstances, according to her sister, Eman always remained patient and funny.  ”She has always had hope that she would lose weight and get better,” Shaimaa says.  But a couple of years ago, things changed. Eman’s weight went up to about 660 pounds (300 kg)  so she put herself on a strict diet.  ”Suddenly her cholesterol levels went up and she lost consciousness,” says Shaimaa.  It took time to find a hospital that would run an MRI on someone of her size, and when they eventually did, she was diagnosed as having had a stroke.  According to Shaimaa, things went downhill from there.  The stroke reduced Eman’s already limited ability to move and speak, and her family had to start taking care of all her needs.  They used hand gestures when they couldn’t understand each other and her body started retaining water her weight bloated to more than 1, 000 pounds. The doctors the family consulted seemed unable to get to the root of the problem.   Shaimaa says Eman’s positivity and cheerfulness fell away.  Obstacles  The opportunity for Eman to be operated on in India is a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak scenario for the    and her family. They were met with roadblocks almost immediately. Eman’s visa application was initially denied because she was unable to go to the Indian embassy in person. Dr. Lakdawala wrote a letter explaining that Eman had barely left her room in decades and pleaded with them to reconsider. When he was told it was still impossible, he tweeted India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj. ”I was left with no other option,” he says. He was pleasantly surprised by her response within two hours she had written back agreeing to help expedite the visa on humanitarian grounds. Organizing transport was another priority, but that presented its own complications, because access to planes is difficult for someone of Eman’s size.  ”Air ambulances normally have a bigger door because they allow stretchers,” says Dr. Lakdawala, but as Eman doesn’t fit on a normal stretcher, he’s had to talk to individual airlines about their capacity to accommodate her. Additionally, Eman is unable to sit in a seat, so the team have to find a flight where she can lie horizontally. They’re also taking into account that, coming from a Muslim country, she might be uncomfortable being cared for by men, so they’ve put together an   team.  ”I will be the only male when it eventually comes to operating on her,” says Dr Lakdawala. As Eman is a ”high risk” patient, Dr. Lakdawala says they will be taking ”all precautions.” And if the operation does go ahead and is a success, Eman will have to stay in Mumbai for a number of months afterward so she can be monitored.  To get her to a stage where she can bend and weighs under 220 pounds (100kg) Dr. Lakdawala says it will take two operations and at least three and half years. Shaimaa collected the visas Wednesday and says she’s optimistic about the future.  ”I know the doctor will exert his best effort.”",-1.0
"From Aretha to Beyoncé: the black artists snubbed by the Grammys. It was not a question of race, insisted Grammys boss Neil Portnow, in the wake of the furore surrounding Adele’s victory over Beyoncé for the album of the year award  —   the top prize  —   at this year’s awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. “I don’t think there’s a race problem at all,” Portnow told Pitchork. “We don’t, as musicians, listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity. ” Portnow’s problem is that a lot of people aren’t convinced by his argument that the 14, 000 voting members of the Recording Academy “almost put a blindfold on” when they listen to the nominated albums. Adele did not seem convinced in her acceptance speech on Sunday night when she said: “I can’t possibly accept this award,” before addressing Beyoncé directly. “You are our light. And the way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering. ” Sufjan Stevens didn’t seem convinced when he wrote that that the “urban contemporary album” category in which Lemonade won is “where the white man puts the incomparable pregnant black woman because he is so threatened by her talent, power, persuasion and potential”. St Vincent did not seem convinced by the snub when she agreed with him. Solange  —   Beyoncé’s sister and a   in her own right  —   did not seem convinced when she hastily tweeted then deleted: “Create your own committees, build your own institutions, give your friends awards, award yourself, and be the gold you wanna hold, my Gs. ” Frank Ocean did not seem convinced when he addressed the Grammy producers on Tumblr: “You know what’s really not ‘great TV’ guys? 1989 getting album of the year over To Pimp a Butterfly   …     If you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it. ” One year, one overlooked album  —   that might not be a problem. The issue for the Grammys is that in an era when RB and   have been going through a period of massive creativity  —   matched by huge commercial success  —   the album of the year prize at the Grammys has been going to white artists. The last black winnner was Herbie Hancock, for River: The Joni Letters in 2008. Since then, Taylor Swift has won twice (for Fearless in 2010 and 1989 in 2016) as has Adele (for 21 in 2012 and 25 this year). Meanwhile, black artists have been shortlisted, but lost out: Beyoncé alone has been in the final five three times since 2010 without winning. Kendrick Lamar has had two shortlisted albums without winning. Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, Pharrell Williams have all been shortlisted without winning. Kanye West has not even been shortlisted since Graduation in 2008, and Drake has been shortlisted just once, for Views, this year. It is not as if these are marginal acts being passed over for something more mainstream that list of names contains many of the main drivers of popular culture. They are hit artists, the   about artists of the moment. Are they really not as good as Mumford  Sons (2013 winners) Arcade Fire (2011 winners) Beck (2015 winner) or Robert Plant  Alison Krauss (2009 winners)? But there is nothing new here. The Grammys have always had a problem with the album of the year award. Looking down a list of winners often has you wondering what on earth the voters were thinking, even when the winner was black (was Natalie Cole’s Unforgettable   …     With Love really the best album of 1992? ). There was a period in the   when album of the year was, more or less, the Stevie Wonder award, as he won it three years out of four between 1974 and 1977, but equally there have been years when the winning album (and the entire shortlist) have ignored not just black music, but a whole load of other great music, too. So, in recognition of the fact that the Grammys have long been both #grammyssowhite and #grammyssocrap, here are some of the least memorable years for the album of the year winner in Grammy history. Winner: Blood, Sweat  Tears by Blood, Sweat  Tears, The album of the year prize ignored rock, soul and RB until 1968, when Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band won. It was back to the soft pop of Glen Campbell the following year, and then in 1970 Blood, Sweat  Tears won. It is not that their second album is bad it was a huge critical and commercial success, and their fusion of classical, rock and jazz styles was groundbreaking. It is more that when you look back at what else was happening, you would be hard picked to call this an album that defined the previous year. Black artists who were overlooked   …     • The Temptations: Cloud Nine, The soul harmony quintet were at their psychedelic soul peak with Cloud Nine, whose opening side  —   Cloud Nine, into I Heard It Through the Grapevine into Runaway Child, Running Wild  —   is one of the great achievements of Motown. • Sly and the Family Stone: Stand! A huge hit album that contained three of the Family Stone’s greatest pop hits  —   the title track, I Want to Take You Higher and Everyday People  —   as well as the discombobulating Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey, was passsed over for the shortlist for album of the year. • Isaac Hayes  —   Hot Buttered Soul, A US No 8 hit, Hot Buttered Soul set a template for soul as the 70s dawned: lubricious, ambitious and luxurious. Hayes stretched out on epic versions of Walk on By and By the Time I Get to Phoenix, and created the soul loverman. A landmark in soul. Hayes did get an album of the year nomination in 1972 for Shaft. The Grammys also missed   …     Led Zeppelin: Led Zeppelin I and Led Zeppelin II, Rolling Stones: Let it Bleed and The Band: The Band, Winner: The Concert for Bangladesh by George Harrison and Friends, Pop’s capacity for backslapping on the rare occasions it manages to do A Good Thing manifested itself in this live recording of Harrison’s charity show winning the album of the year prize. This is rarely an album dug out when one fancies hearing a former Beatle. Black artists who were overlooked   …     • The O’Jays: Back Stabbers, Two brilliant, massive singles  —   the title track and Love Train  —   and a top 10 album were not enough to draw the attention of the Recording Academy, even if Back Stabbers was the pinnacle of the Philly soul sound. • Aretha Franklin: Young, Gifted and Black, Aretha Franklin has won the Grammy for best female RB vocal performance 11 times, but has never even been nominated for album of the year. That’s despite the fact that in the late 60s and early 70s, on Atlantic, she produced arguably the greatest run of soul albums ever: this is one without a single track you would skip. • Curtis Mayfield: Super Fly, A film soundtrack that overshadowed its parent film, Super Fly was a huge creative breakthrough for Mayfield, and a critical and commercial smash: a soul concept album that stood up in its own right, with impassioned commentary on the state of black America. The Grammys also missed   …     Neil Young: Harvest, Todd Rundgren:  ? and David Bowie: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, Winner: 52nd Street by Billy Joel, There’s nothing wrong with 52nd Street  —   it’s got My Life on it, and who doesn’t like My Life?  —   but when you look at what was missed out that year, you realise that this was the Grammys at their very safest. Black artists who were overlooked   …     • Chic: Risqué  The year being rewarded, 1979, had been the Chic Organisation’s annus mirabilis. The third Chic album opened with Good Times, the song that to this day defines the sound of disco, but that was only the start of Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers’s achievements that year   …     • Sister Sledge: We Are Family, Chic also took the reins of the soul trio, producing what Rodgers believes to be “our best album, hands down”. And who is to argue, given it contained He’s the Greatest Dancer and Lost in Music, as well as the title track? • Michael Jackson: Off the Wall, As if missing the previous two was not bad enough, the Grammys also ignored what was, arguably, Michael Jackson’s greatest album (Thriller would win in 1984). The only disco record to get an album of the year nomination in this, the genre’s golden year, was Donna Summer’s Bad Girls. Though there was room on the shortlist for both Minute by Minute by the Doobie Brothers and The Gambler by Kenny Rogers. Just not Off the Wall. Or Risqué. Or We Are Family. For shame. The Grammys also missed   …     The Clash: London Calling, Neil Young: Rust Never Sleeps. Abba: Voulez Vous, Winner: Christopher Cross by Christopher Cross, As the aftershocks of punk echoed through music, as hard rock enjoyed a massive resurgence, as disco started to give way to   the Recording Academy decided that the best album of 1980 had been a soft rock record of unimpeachable craftsmanship (if you count John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Double Fantasy as soft rock, we are in the midst of a   run of soft rock winners). Black artists who were overlooked   …     • Diana Ross: Diana, The Chic Organisation were back, this time steering Diana Ross to make what was probably her best solo album, led by a pair of hits  —   Upside Down and I’m Coming Out  —   that were as good as anything she ever recorded. • Teddy Pendergrass: TP, The leading male RB singer of his era had been passed over the previous year for Teddy, and the pattern was repeated with TP. Never mind that it was a platinum album, that Pendergrass was at the peak of his powers, and that Love TKO was one of the great Philly singles. • The Jacksons: Triumph, Well, if you’re going to disregard Off the Wall, you may as well disregard what was to all intents and purposes its successor, too. Michael Jackson, at the top of his game, did most of the lead singing and writing on Triumph, another platinum album. Incredibly, the brilliant opener Can You Feel It peaked at No 77 in the US. The Grammys also missed, Pink Floyd: The Wall,  : Back in Black, David Bowie: Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) Winner: No Jacket Required by Phil Collins, After a   break for Thriller and Lionel Richie’s Can’t Slow Down, the soft rock supremacy returned with No Jacket Required. It’s not a bad album  —   none of these winners is  —   but there were some issues with what was missed. Black artists who were overlooked   …     • Prince: Around the World in a Day, Prince’s 1999 had been nominated for album of the year in 1985, but lost out to Can’t Slow Down. Prince was also nominated for Sign o’ the Times in 1988 but incredibly never won album of the year. • Whitney Houston: Whitney Houston, Never mind that voice, or those three US No 1 singles: the   debut album by a singer who redefined female   and RB singing, and who became the biggest star of her generation, crossing race boundaries and appealing to young and old, black and white, was no match for No Jacket Required. Though nominated in three categories at the 1986 Grammys, Houston won only one, for best pop vocal performance (for Saving All My Love for You). • Luther Vandross: The Night I Feel In Love, The    80s were the heyday of the smooth, sophisticated male soul star as well as Vandross, Alexander O’Neal was an international star, and Freddie Jackson’s debut album was a monster US hit in 1985. At this point, it may not come as a surprise that none of the smooth, sophisticated male soul stars were ever nominated for album of the year. The Grammys also missed   …     Kate Bush: Hounds of Love, Tom Waits: Rain Dogs and Talking Heads: Little Creatures, Winner: MTV Unplugged by Eric Clapton, There is a case for saying that no awards ceremony that preaches diversity should ever reward Eric Clapton, who  —   despite being given multiple opportunities to do so  —   has never seen fit to apologise for or backtrack from his notorious onstage pronouncement in 1976 that “Enoch was right”. Yet he was rewarded for an album of acoustic rerecordings of old tracks in one of  ’s great years. Black artists who were overlooked   …     • Michael Jackson: Dangerous, It dealt with the kind of platitudinous big themes that often get rewarded (Black or White, Heal the World) it took Jackson into new jack swing, it sold a bazillion copies, but Dangerous did not even get a nomination. Bad had been nominated, in 1988, but Thriller was to be the only album of the year award Jackson ever won. • Arrested Development: 3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of   …     A landmark in conscious   that managed to be infectiously enjoyable, intriguingly weird and joyously danceable  —   as well as being one of the first statements that southern   was about to eclipse its coastal counterparts. • Mary J Blige: What’s the 411? Blige’s first album was the big hit that the Grammys require before granting one of the big awards. It was also, like the album above, a portent of something new, in this case the melding of   and soul into something that managed to be simultaneously tougher than leather, but washed down with tears. The Grammys also missed   …     Beastie Boys: Check Your Head, Tori Amos: Little Earthquakes and U2: Achtung Baby, Winner: MTV Unplugged by Tony Bennett  One sure way of getting Grammy success was to be a great recontextualising your music: hence Clapton, and in 2000 Santana’s Supernatural album, pairing him with younger artists. Tony Bennett revisiting his back catalogue fell   in the middle of that period. It is hard to begrudge an evidently decent man, and a great singer, but once again, look at what was passed over. Black artists who were overlooked   …     Nas: Illmatic, One of the great   albums, one of the great debut albums, and a hit to boot  —   it peaked in the US chart at No 12. This was a landmark   album, yet it would be another nine years before OutKast’s   Love Below became the first   record to win the album of the year award. Warren G: Regulate   …     G Funk Era, Warren G actually got two nominations in the 1995 Grammys  —   for best rap solo performance and best rap performance by a duo or a group  —   but the album of the year category that year rewarded safety: alongside Bennett, the nominees were the Three Tenors, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt and Seal. The Notorious BIG: Ready to Die, One of the greatest rappers ever, and someone who helped revitalise east coast   Biggie Smalls never got an album of the year nomination. In what was already a depressingly familiar pattern, he was instead confined to genre categories, with Big Poppa getting a best rap solo performance nomination the following year. The Grammys also missed   …     Soundgarden  —   Superunknown, Nine Inch Nails: The Downward Spiral, Jeff Buckley: Grace, • This article was amended on 19 February 2017 to correct a misspelling of Teddy Pendergrass’s name.",-0.5
"Home-Based Drug Treatment Program Costs Less And Works. Hannah Berkowitz is 20 years old. When she was a senior in high school her life flew off the rails. She was getting high on whatever drugs she could get her hands on. She was suicidal. Berkowitz moved into a therapeutic boarding school to get sober, but could only stay sober while she was on campus during the week. ”I’d come home and try to stay sober really hard  —   really, really hard,” says Berkowitz. ”Sometimes I’d make it through the weekend, and sometimes I just couldn’t make it. It was   it, just holding on.” The transition back home always triggered a relapse for Berkowitz. ”I thought it was just my fault and there was no hope,” she says. No hope  —   but Berkowitz did have luck. She had private health insurance and she lived in Connecticut, where a startup company, Aware Recovery Care, had begun treating clients in the very environment where Hannah was struggling to stay sober: her home. A chronic disease approach, Treating addiction is a growing business, but a lot of the treatment that’s available is expensive and patients often relapse. Fortunately, there is a way to help some people pay less for better results, says Matt Eacott, vice president of Aware Recovery Care. ”  percent of the industry really treats addiction as an acute problem  —   like a rash on your arm that you rub lotion on and you’re done,” says Eacott. Instead, Aware treats addiction as a chronic illness  —   it doesn’t disappear just because symptoms are temporarily under control. The approach is a   way of treating addiction, Eacott says, with better results than most competitors achieve. Aware comes into clients’ homes and connects them with a nurse, a primary care doctor, a therapist, peer support,   meetings and a case manager. Clients hooked on opioids can get   treatment. They can also submit to urine screening and GPS tracking, if that helps them stick with the program. Hannah’s mother, Lois Berkowitz, says the program is intense at first. But as Hannah built coping skills the supports faded into the background. ”It’s not like they’re doing the work for the addict,” says Lois Berkowitz, ”they’re just basically taking them by the hand and saying, ’Here are the places you need to go that will help you. And I’m going to go with you to start, so it doesn’t feel that uncomfortable. And then we’re going to let you fly.’ ” Before they ”fly,” Aware clients have a pretty long runway. The treatment lasts for a full year. Benefits worth the initial cost, insurer says, Aware has now expanded from its base in Connecticut into New Hampshire. The program is expensive. It costs $38, 000 a year. As of now, it’s only available to   clients and people insured through Anthem health insurance in New Hampshire and Connecticut. Anthem became the first insurer to pay Aware, because the treatment is based on hard science that’s yielding solid results for clients, says Dr. Steven Korn, Anthem’s behavioral health medical director. Science and results are rare in addiction treatment, he says. ”There are old, old notions that have hung pretty tough,” says Korn. ”When I was young  —   when I was in training  —   as soon as substance abuse was mentioned, the response of physicians was, ’Well, go to AA. That’s not our problem. We don’t treat that.’ ” For a year of treatment, Anthem says it’s paying Aware about the same as the cost of a month or two of inpatient treatment. Anthem also says 72 percent of Aware clients are either sober at the end of one year or still in active treatment. That’s about twice the sobriety rate of people who check in to a facility for a month and then get no   care, says Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Treating addiction at home makes sense because it’s the exact place where people learned all their bad habits, Gitlow says. ”It’s all based on this concept that addiction is not about the substance use,” he says, ”but is about what led to the substance use in the first place. And you can’t really get there without getting to know the patient.” Aware says it’s in negotiations with four more major insurers. The program hopes to have a couple hundred clients in New Hampshire by the end of the year.

"Trump Justice Dept takes first antitrust action. The U.S. Justice Department has filed an antitrust challenge to Parker Hannifin's $4.4 billion purchase of Clarcor, which was completed back in February. At issue is DoJ's belief that the merger eliminated all competition in the market for airplane fuel filtration products. The Trump Administration isn't asking for the entire merger to be unwound, but does want the court to force Parker Hannifin to sell off either its own airplane filtration business or Clarcor's. Why it matters: This is the first antitrust action brought by Trump's DoJ, although his FTC earlier sought to block the DraftKings-Fanduel merger (which was subsequently canceled). Bottom line: The antitrust ""waiting period"" for this deal expired on Jan. 18, and Parker Hannifin formally closed the deal one month later. But DoJ now says that its lack of objection at the time wasn't reflective of de facto approval after review, but rather was the result of Parker Hannifin's failure to provide requested documents and data.",0.0
"Trump meets with ’Putin’s favorite congressman’ as Russia story swirls. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump, amid questions about his campaign’s ties to Russia during the 2016 election, met Tuesday with Dana Rohrabacher, a California congressman so   for his   views that he has been referred to as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ”favorite congressman.” Ken Grubbs, a spokesman for Rohrabacher, declined to disclose the focus of the Oval Office conversation, calling it ”a general conversation at the President’s invitation.” ”We have nothing more than that,” Grubbs said, A statement from Rohrabacher’s office Tuesday evening said the meeting lasted 45 minutes and included White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon. In the statement, Rohrabacher said Trump was ”keen” on his proposal to create a visa program that he said would help pay for Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Rohrabacher, after operating as an   congressman during the end of the Cold War, has become a vocal   voice in the Republican Party, regularly taking Russia’s side in public debates and backing Trump’s comments on the country. He even has bragged about   and playing soccer with Putin during a trip Russian leaders made to the United States in the early 1990s. ”We started arguing about who won the Cold War. And so we decided to settle it like men do when they’ve had too much to drink in the pub. So we got to these arm wrestling matches, and I ended up being paired off with Putin,” Rohrabacher said during a 2013 interview with KPCC, a California public radio station. ”He’s a little guy, but boy, I’ll tell ya. He put me down in a millisecond! He is tough. His muscles are just unbelievable.” His meeting with Trump comes at a significant time for the administration: Two congressional committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, and the FBI is looking into contacts between Trump advisers and Russian operatives during the election. Trump has downplayed the investigations and connections. ”Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years,” Trump said in February. He has since said the investigations are an attempt to justify Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss in the presidential election. Like Trump, Rohrabacher has downplayed the investigations and the fact that Russia interfered with the 2016 election. ”Did they try to influence our election? We have tried to influence their elections, and everybody’s elections,” Rohrabacher told the Los Angeles Times in March. ”The American people are being fed information that would lead them to believe that we need to be in a   stance when it comes to Russia.” Rohrabacher also said earlier this year that he planned to take a congressional trip to Russia to work with lawmakers.  In December, Rohrabacher told The Washington Post that people incorrectly think ”Putin is the same as Stalin.” ”That is not the case,” Rohrabacher said of the comparison to Russia’s dictatorial communist leaders during World War II. The meeting also comes as multiple activist groups in Syria tell CNN that dozens of people, including children, were killed in one of the deadliest gas attacks the country has seen during years of civil war. Activists have blamed the attack in the   city of Khan Sheikhoun on the Syrian President Bashar  ’s regime. Rohrabacher, in a break with many in his party, has argued that Assad should be the United States’ partner in the Syrian civil war. ”Assad is not our enemy. Neither is Russia our enemy,” Rohrabacher  said in 2016 during contentious interview with MSNBC. ”The radical Islamists who have been murdering Americans by the thousands since   are the enemy.  The Trump administration condemned the Syrian attack Tuesday, calling it ”reprehensible” and ”heinous.”  But spokesman Sean Spicer lay blame on the Obama administration. ”These heinous actions by the Bashar   regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution,” he said.",-1.0
"’Brady Bunch’ Mom Florence Henderson Has Died. Florence Henderson, who went from Broadway star to become one of America’s most beloved television moms in The Brady Bunch, has died, her manager and her publicist said. She was 82. Henderson died Thursday night at   Medical Center in Los Angeles, after being hospitalized the day before, said her publicist, David Brokaw. Henderson had suffered heart failure, her manager Kayla Pressman said in a statement. Family and friends had surrounded Henderson’s hospital bedside, Pressman said. On the surface, The Brady Bunch with Henderson as its   matriarch Carol Brady, resembled just another TV sitcom about a family living in suburban America and getting into a different wacky situation each week. But well after it ended its initial run, in 1974, the show resonated with audiences, and it returned to television in various forms again and again, including The Brady Bunch Hour in 1977, The Brady Brides in 1981 and The Bradys in 1990. It was also seen endlessly in reruns. ”It represents what people always wanted: a loving family. It’s such a gentle, innocent, sweet show, and I guess it proved there’s always an audience for that,” Henderson said in 1999. Premiering in 1969, it also was among the first shows to introduce to television the blended family. As its theme song reminded viewers each week, Henderson’s Carol was a single mother raising three daughters when she met her TV husband, Robert Reed’s Mike Brady, a single father who was raising three boys. The eight of them became The Brady Bunch, with a quirky housekeeper, played by Ann B. Davis, thrown into the mix. The blonde,   Henderson was already a Broadway star when the show began, having originated the title role in the musical Fanny. But after The Brady Bunch, she would always be known to fans as Carol Brady. ”We had to have security guards with us. Fans were hanging on our doors. We couldn’t go out by ourselves. We were like the Beatles!” she said of the attention the show brought the cast. Like the Beatles, there was even a Saturday morning cartoon version called Brady Kids, although Henderson was not in that show. She and Reed did return, however, for The Brady Bunch Hour, The Brady Brides and The Bradys. So did most of the original cast. She was also back again in 1995 when a new cast was assembled for The Brady Bunch Movie, a playful spoof of the original show. This time she was Grandma Brady opposite Shelly Long’s Carol. Numerous memoirs also kept interest in the show alive, as cast members revealed they were more than just siblings off camera. Barry Williams, who played eldest son Greg Brady, would confess to having a crush on his TV stepmom. Henderson, in her own book, denied having any relationship with Williams, but did acknowledge a fling with former New York City mayor John Lindsay. Henderson was a    drama student in New York when she landed a   role in the play Wish You Were Here. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were so impressed they made her the female lead in a 1952 road tour of Oklahoma! When the show returned to Broadway for a revival in 1954, she continued in the role and won rave reviews. ”She is the real thing, right of of a butter churn somewhere,” wrote Walter Kerr of the New York Herald Tribune. To broaden her career, Henderson took acting, dancing, singing and guitar lessons, even studying French and Italian. She went on to play Maria in a road production of The Sound of Music, was Nellie Forbush in a revival of South Pacific and was back on Broadway with Jose Ferrer in The Girl Who Came to Supper in 1963. She made her movie debut in 1970 in Song of Norway, based on the 1944 operetta with music by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Her career nearly came to an end in 1965 when she suddenly lost her hearing while appearing in The King and I in Los Angeles. She was diagnosed with a hereditary condition called osteosclerosis. ”Corrective surgery in both ears restored my hearing,” she said in 2007. As her TV career blossomed with The Brady Bunch, Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host The Tonight Show for the vacationing Johnny Carson. For eight years she also commuted to Nashville to conduct a cooking and talk series, Country Kitchen, on The Nashville Network. The show resulted in a book, Florence Henderson’s Short Cut Cooking. After The Brady Bunch ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including Hart to Hart, Fantasy Island and The Love Boat. In later years she also made guest appearances on such shows as Roseanne, Ally McBeal and The King of Queens. Florence Agnes Henderson was born Feb. 14, 1934, in the small town of Dale in southern Indiana. She was the 10th child of a tobacco sharecropper of Irish descent. In grade school, she joined the choir at a Catholic church in Rockport, Ind. After high school she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a   program at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, her studies financed by a theatrical couple who had been impressed by her singing when they saw her perform in high school. She dropped out of the program after one year, however, to take the role in Wish You Were There. Henderson married theater executive Ira Bernstein and the couple had four children before the union ended in divorce after 29 years. Her second husband, John Kappas, died in 2002. Pressman said she is survived by her children Barbara, Joseph, Robert and Lizzie, their respective spouses, and five grandchildren.",-0.5
"Italy earthquake: mafia-busting chief warns of criminal reconstruction.  (CNN) Italy’s   chief is adamant that the country’s notorious crime syndicate must be kept from infiltrating reconstruction efforts, as an investigation opened into why so many buildings collapsed in a devastating earthquake last week. The earthquake that struck central Italy before dawn on Wednesday flattened entire villages in ancient towns like Amatrice, but even newly constructed buildings that were supposed to be   including a school, were destroyed. Italy earthquake: Amid the rubble, a couple says ’I do’ ”The risks are there, it’s impossible to hide. And   reconstruction is historically a delicious morsel for criminal groups and business interests,”   prosecutor Franco Roberti told the Italian daily La Repubblica.  He said the country could learn lessons from the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, in which more than 2, 400 people died. ”Behind those thousands of dead was reckless building and clan affairs,” Roberti said.  ”And without wishing to rush judgments I see that also in 2016 many buildings crumbled, public buildings also. Too many,” he said, adding that if   standards had been met, buildings might crack but shouldn’t collapse.  ”This is why . .. I imagine there’s a lot to learn.” He said, however, that the reconstruction after an earthquake in L’Aquila in 2009, which killed more than 300 people, had been largely successful.  Devastation, The quake has so far claimed the lives of at least 290 people, and as hopes of finding any more survivors are all but gone, officials are now faced with cleaning up the mountains of rubble and organizing a mammoth reconstruction plan.  In Amatrice    the worst hit town    the main road was almost entirely destroyed. Bulldozers are now demolishing the   structures that have no hope of being repaired. Amatrice’s mayor has vowed to rebuild the town as it was, but some are wondering if that’s smart to do in a town that lies on a fault line    officials on the ground estimate that it could take five years. Trials continue over ’ ’ reconstruction, Italy has long struggled with mafia power and corruption. The finance ministry has its own police force and has sent officers to monitor the recovery so that all resources go to the right people and places. The country’s law enforcement agencies are in a renewed   drive, and more than 140 people are currently on trial for helping the southern ’Ndrangheta mafia infiltrate the country’s wealthy north. Many of them were accused of helping the network profit illegally from reconstruction projects after deadly earthquakes in the   region in 2012. Anna Sergi, an organized crime expert from the University of Essex, said she was pessimistic that the country would be able to keep the mafia entirely out of the reconstruction. ”Construction is one of the mafia’s main sources of revenue, partly because construction is linked to territory, so the mafia not only seeks construction contracts for money, but also to mark their territory,” Sergi told CNN.  ”There is very likely to be corruption in a reconstruction effort like this, because in Italy, where there is a lot of money, there is always a link to mafia power.” Another challenge in keeping them out of the picture is that they are very difficult to spot these days. Italy earthquake survivors: ’The future is finished’ ”In more traditional areas of mafia power, they used to use guns and violence to intimidate people, but in most places, they now look more like businessmen, who use corruption and threats to win contracts.” What often happens, Sergi said, is that a   company will win a contract for a certain amount of money, and underpay its   to pocket a wider margin. ”They pay their workers way less, so they of course do a worse job, and that leads to higher maintenance costs, and in many case, more money generated for them.”   Corruption a ’cancer in Italy’ In some affected parts of central Italy, the villages are so small that officials have to weigh up whether they will bother rebuilding at all. The village of Capricchia has a few hundred people living there in the summer, when residents from cities visit the mountains to get out of the heat. But in the winter, there are usually 12 to 15 residents. In the village, Rosella Santarelli is staying in a campervan, too afraid to stay in a building as aftershocks continue. ”I don’t think there’ll be a future. Our village is poor, there are no people and no jobs. Amatrice is 5 miles away, but there’s nothing left of that.” And even in L’Aquila, where the reconstruction was apparently a success, some said they felt they were left out of the town’s rebuild, and that too much had been spent fixing the damage to the historic center rather than their neighborhoods. ”In Italy, corruption is the big problem,” Davide Tonati, 36, told CNN in L’Aquila.  ”There are many politicians and bribes. It is the cancer in Italy.”",-1.0
"Chicago Debt Downgraded to Near ’Junk Bonds’ - Breitbart. Fitch Ratings downgraded the City of Chicago’s credit rating to just one step above “junk bonds” on March 28. [Fitch stated that last week’s Illinois Supreme Court decision voiding a law aimed at boosting funding for two of the city’s pension funds was “among the worst of the possible outcomes for the city’s credit quality. ”  The agency’s credit analysts warned that the rating could be downgraded further in the absence of “a realistic plan that puts the pension funds on an affordable path toward solvency. ”  Chicago’s debt rating was slashed   to   which is just one step above “junk. ” The new rating affects $9. 8 billion of the city’s general obligation bonds (GOs) and $486 million of sales tax revenue bonds. In what was considered a controversial decision last May, Moody’s Investor Services cut Chicago’s credit rating to junk by chopping it rating by two notches from Baa2 to Ba1. Standard  Poor’s chose to maintain its investment grade rating on America’s    in July, but lowered the credit score by one notch to   from  . With Fitch and Standard  Poor’s credit services still rating the Chicago bonds investment grade, the city was able to sell $500 million in municipal bonds on January 12 at what Reuters referred to as a “hefty yield” for an investment grade issue of 4. 875 percent. But the troubled Chicago Board of Education, already rated as “junk” by all three credit rating agencies, was forced to pay an 8. 5 percent yield to sell only $725 million of an originally planned $795. 5 million of   bond issue on February 3. Fitch’s issued a terse March 28 statement, “Not only did (the Illinois Supreme Court) strike down the pension reform legislation in its entirety, but it made clear that the city bears responsibility to fund the promised pension benefits, even if the pension funds become insolvent. ” Chicago’s unfunded pension obligations total $29. 80 billion for its four main retirement systems. At a stunning 15. 9 percent of its entire property tax base, that is the highest of America’s 50 largest local governments, according to a recent report by Moody’s. The Illinois Supreme Court rejected Chicago’s assertion that a 2014 state law affecting the city’s municipal and laborers’ retirement systems would actually have been a benefit to workers and retirees by taking steps to avoid an expected pension fund insolvencies in the next 10 to 13 years. But the city’s powerful unions and retirees challenged the law, because it required the city and affected workers to increase their pension contributions and eliminated the wildly expensive 3 percent guaranteed automatic annual    increase for retirees. Fitch said Chicago now “must rely on meaningful use of revenue and expenditure controls to meet much higher annual payments. ” Despite the debt crisis, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that Chicago still intends to raise as much as $1. 25 billion in another GO bond sale this year.",1.0
"Banksy Puts Mark on Bethlehem Hotel With ‘Worst View in the World’ - The New York Times. Welcome to the “hotel with the worst view in the world. ” Please be mindful of the   art on the walls. The elusive British street artist Banksy has decorated the interiors of the Walled Off Hotel, a   guesthouse in the West Bank city of Bethlehem whose windows overlook the barrier that separates the territory from Israel. Among the rooms decorated by the artist, who has earned a following for tagging walls around the world with witty illustrations and dark political commentaries, is the “Banksy Room. ” In the room, a mural on the wall above a   bed depicts a Palestinian and an Israeli locked in combat  —   only they are having a pillow fight. Banksy, who rarely comments on his work and keeps his real identity a secret, has made trips to the West Bank for years and has previously, under cover of night, painted the barrier itself. On a recent trip, he painted a mural on the barrier, just steps from his current project, showing a girl being pulled aloft by balloons. Last year, four street murals in Gaza were attributed to him, including one depicting a Greek goddess amid the rubble of a destroyed house. In addition to the guest rooms, Banksy has created something of a museum that includes surveillance cameras mounted like taxidermic trophies, a Grecian bust surrounded by a cloud meant to depict tear gas, and a wax statue depicting the signing of the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 letter of British intent to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The hotel will open to guests on March 11, with rooms starting at $30 a night. Banksy, who first came to prominence by stenciling artworks on the walls of Bristol, England, has become an international superstar. In 2015, he created an exhibit called Dismaland, in which works by Israeli and Palestinian artists were displayed side by side. Some of Banksy’s works have sold at auction for more than $1 million.",-1.0
"French Universities Play Politics by Emailing Students to Vote Macron. French university academics have made an extraordinary intervention in the French election, emailing students and urging them to back establishment candidate Emmanuel Macron. [The president of the University of Angers in Western France, Christian Roblédo, claimed in an email to students that, “as a university professor” it was his “duty to denounce the harmful ideology that [Marine Le Pen] conveys”.  He characterised this ideology as “withdrawal into oneself, intolerance, fear of the other [and] refusal of differences” in opposition to “humanism, openness, pluralism and freedom of expression”  —   the values which, in Roblédo’s estimation, “constitute the very essence of higher education and research in France”. “Already in 2002, we were placed before such a choice,” he said, recalling the second round showdown between Jacques Chirac and Marine Le Pen’s father,  . Mr. Le Pen was expelled from the Front National by his daughter as she reformed it into a moderate, populist movement. “[In 2002] a Republican front had come together to make the Front National score as low as possible,” wrote Roblédo. “[Again] we have to vote massively so that [Marine Le Pen] does not win the presidential election. ” Anticipating criticism of his intervention as an abuse of his public position, the professor concluded by saying that “[Sometimes] the values of a man’s life take precedence over all other considerations. In addressing you as president of the University, the duty of reserve is obliterated by the threats to the institutional foundations on which our University is based. ” WATCH | @MLP_officiel to @EmmanuelMacron: ”France will be led by a woman, either me or Angela Merkel!” 👏🇷😂 pic. twitter.   —   LEAVE. EU  (@LeaveEUOfficial) May 3, 2017,  Colleague Manuel Tunon de Lara, president of the University of Bordeaux, was equally unabashed, writing of his “responsibility to call on the academic community to vote next Sunday to block   …     the accession of Marine Le Pen to the presidency of the French Republic. ” He claimed that the “Marine Le Pen programme” was incompatible “with the academic values we have hitherto defended”. “How to defend openness in a country that would close its borders?” he asked. “My position is not an isolated position,” he declared. “It is associated with that advocated by the Conference of University Presidents, which called for ‘voting against the extremism of the candidature of Marine Le Pen’. ”",1.0
"After Ray Rice: Inside a batterer’s mind.  (CNN) He’s nothing like I imagined. His demeanor is gentle, his smile and handshake warm, his words friendly and measured. He asks permission before taking a bite of his takeout salad.  Where’s the batterer I’ve come to meet? The man who grabbed, pushed and punched a woman he claimed to love?  The one I’ve enlisted to help me understand: Why do some men do this? How can they be stopped?  ”Dylan” is Ivy   a   nerd who was raised by loving parents with advanced degrees. He grew up in a beautiful home in a tony Atlanta suburb. He enjoyed every privilege a boy could want. He vacationed in places like Cairo, London and Paris before he could even shave. He defies the stereotypical image of a batterer I have in mind. I’m ashamed of my own naiveté. Lesson one: Just because he had it so good doesn’t mean he wasn’t capable of becoming brutal.  Dylan has met me after work in a quiet office outside Atlanta. He’s asked that I change his name and hide his identity to protect him and his victim. In exchange, he has agreed to take me back to a time he’d rather forget. He will map out how he became an abuser. And how, some 10 years later, he became a new person, the man he wanted to be. Going inside the mind of a batterer, I’ll learn, means examining much more than the images we hold onto. The story of suspended NFL running back Ray Rice, and other abusers, doesn’t end with a   punch in an elevator or an attack never seen on video. Nor do these tragedies begin there.  Power and control, Dylan’s parents weren’t perfect. Neither were friends who he idolized. Not many people are.  Scene one: His mother and father argued. The abuse was verbal, sometimes physical. Twice he watched his father push his mother.   Scene two: He was sitting on a bus in the high school parking lot. He watched out the window as an upperclassman he respected struck his girlfriend. Hard. She was the sort of girl Dylan dreamed of dating someday. He gawked with others as she cowered and bled. At home and at school, no one talked about what Dylan saw. Love between a man and a woman, as far as he could tell, was allowed to look this way.  Now, in his   Dylan has a tool for identifying what he witnessed    and how he acted himself.  ”Have you ever seen the power and control wheel?” he asks me.  I have no idea what this means. He pulls out a sheet with a round diagram. It shows tactics a man might use to gain leverage in a relationship, ways he may behave before resorting to physical or sexual violence. These are the less obvious, but insidious, means by which men keep women down. Red flags Dylan couldn’t identify back then. Minimizing. Coercion. Male privilege. At first, the language sounds like   psychobabble. But soon I realize that the wheel represents everything I’d like to caution my nieces about before they go out into the world.  Dylan was in college when he met his first girlfriend. Early on, without even knowing her friends, he told her he didn’t like them. Isolation. Controlling who she sees.  When she came to his room later at night than he wanted, he locked the door    something he never did otherwise    and made her knock. He took his time answering to remind her who was boss. Male privilege. Acting like the ”master of the castle.”   Fast forward to after college. He was living with a new girlfriend, ”Isabelle,” in Atlanta. She might have had the better job, but he was the one who could drive. She has a disability and depended on him to get to work. He didn’t let her forget it. Threats. Making her feel guilty. The cloud of economic abuse she could lose her job.  His boss treated him like an idiot, but Dylan felt he had to take it. Out in the world, it seemed like people walked all over him. So at home, Dylan exerted power in the only place he felt he could. He was making more money by then, he says, and had earned the right to ”act like a man.” More male privilege. Defining their roles. He criticized how she did her hair, what she wore, even the way she filled the dishwasher. Emotional abuse. Making her feel small and humiliated.  You see how this works, right? He kept the wheel   and it would eventually spin out of control. Smarter than this, It’s one thing to hear his story, but what about hers? Once I learned he was still in touch with Isabelle, I told Dylan I wanted to give voice to her perspective, too. It seemed only fair, I said. He didn’t think she’d be interested in talking, but he agreed to reach out to her for me. A week later, Isabelle and I first communicated.  She was eager to speak, but only if I used a pseudonym. She doesn’t want her past to define her present or future. Growing up thousands of miles from Dylan, Isabelle watched her father suppress her mother. He degraded her with his words and threw things to intimidate her. Even though her mother would later find the strength to leave, Isabelle learned early about submission. Today, she seems   and certainly no pushover as we share chips and salsa in a small Mexican joint. Thinking back to how her relationship with Dylan unfolded, she says she should have seen what was coming.  Survivors of domestic abuse speak out, She’d taken to going away on weekends to escape him. She pleaded with him to move out of her house, but he wouldn’t budge. He used her inability to drive against her    even though she’d managed just fine before he came along.  He isolated her from friends and family. Too ashamed to admit how unhappy and worried she was, she isolated herself further. He put her down in public and made her feel like a child. She was embarrassed. After all, she had a master’s degree. She was smarter than this.  Still, for so long, she hungered for what they had when the relationship was good. ”I wanted him to come back to me as I remembered him,” she says. ”I lived for those moments when he would show up.” When she changed the radio station in the car without asking, he says he gave her a push and yelled about wanting to be respected.  She remembers him pinning her against the door in the moving car and worried that if it opened she’d be a goner.  When she once called him an asshole, he grabbed her arm: ”If you want to call me an asshole, I’ll show you an asshole,” he says. Why I stayed: Tangles of domestic abuse, It was a Sunday morning, when he crossed the line for the last time. This is how Dylan recalls it: She’d been up late talking on the phone with a male friend, and Dylan decided she was cheating. He ripped up some of her favorite photographs. He called her a bitch and a whore. He took a vase of flowers    ”they were irises,” he says, thinking back a decade    and dumped it over her head. He threatened to break her cell phone. And then, he unleashed his remaining rage with a punch to her chest. ”In that moment,” he says, ”I realized what I’d done.” He picked up the flowers and poured on the apologies. He left to give her space. He was at his parents’ house when the sheriff’s deputy drove up and served him a temporary restraining order.  Dylan never fought it. That last punch was a jolt to him, too. He’d assaulted his girlfriend of more than four years on, of all days, Father’s Day.  ”I will not bring a child into this,” he remembers thinking. ”I was very clear that I needed to find a new way to move in the world because the way I was moving wasn’t working and wasn’t healthy.”  When he stood before the court, he quickly agreed to stay away from her for a year. He didn’t want her to have to sit on a stand and recount all he’d done.  He says he wanted to protect her feelings. But to be honest, Dylan didn’t want to hear it.  ’Lucky to be alive’ The story she tells is less sanitized and more haunting. Isabelle says on the day of ”the incident,” she thought she’d die. She hadn’t been on the phone late at night, as he remembers it. No, she’d escaped to a hotel to crash with visiting friends and had stayed up late with them.  Back home that Sunday morning, Isabelle was jolted awake from a nap when he grabbed her. ”He called me a whore,” she says, and began ”ragdolling me around the house.”  That vase of flowers he spilled over her? He intended to break it over her head, she believes, but she was able to push his arm away. He tried to snap her cell phone in two and asked her which half she’d want. She tried to close a door between them, which only enraged him further: ”Never shut the door on me!” Then came that punch to her chest, which sent her      frame flying into a heap of laundry on the floor. The world, she says, fell silent. And then ”the universe said just play dead, and so I did.” He was sufficiently freaked out and backed off long enough for her to crawl into the bathroom and lock herself inside.  He peppered her with apologies through the door. He offered her Advil. She laughs at the absurdity of that suggestion. As if Advil could make things better?  ”You need to leave,” she says she told him. ”And I suggest you take an overnight bag.” She’s grateful there was no weapon in the house. A friend came over to help her. She called a locksmith to change the locks before she left the house. She wore a turtleneck to hide the growing bruises. She pretended she was OK. But in the restaurant where the two friends went, Isabelle could barely breathe. Her friend took her to the hospital, where ”the doctor said, ’I don’t know how you’re alive.’ ” One inch to the left, she was told, and the direct blow to her chest could have killed her.  ”I’m very lucky,” she says. ”I have angels on my shoulders.” Owning what he’d done, Dylan promised the court he’d stay away. No contact. No phone calls. No showing up at her door. He paid restitution, covering some expenses such as the cost of changing the locks in her house.  He then set out to change himself.  He camped out in the   section of Barnes  Noble. He armed himself with books, including ”Anger Management for Dummies.”  When books could only take him so far, he sought out more and came across Men Stopping Violence, a national training institute committed to creating safer communities for women and girls. The    organization conducts trainings in churches, corporations, community groups, government agencies and schools.  The primary aim is prevention, to help society understand and change the social norms that create violent men    and thereby prevent the abuse of women from even starting. Only a small fraction of batterers get busted, explains MSV Executive Director Ulester Douglas. It’s better to engage all men before they abuse    whether they are black, white, rich, poor, young or old. ”If we rely only on intervention, we miss the mark,” Douglas says. ”Prevention is what we need, and this must be a systemic approach.”  But there is an intervention arm of MSV, and Dylan signed up for its   educational course to learn alternatives to controlling and abusive behavior.  The   course, which teaches about 220 men a year, draws those who’ve been sent under court order and men, like Dylan, who      oftentimes because they feel they have too much to lose. Maybe a wife has threatened to leave unless they get help.  Or protective services has required their attendance before they can see their children again.  Dylan learned to let go of his definition of manhood, the image society drills into boys. It says tears are for sissies, vulnerability is a sign of weakness. It teaches that the only manly emotions are anger and rage.  He owned what he’d done and who he’d become. Only then could he change. He found out how to be intentional and thoughtful. He became versed in what Men Stopping Violence calls ”The Arc of Choice,” a path lined with ”speed bumps” to stop   attacks    verbal or otherwise. He learned to take deep breaths and think about his choices. He learned to honor his true emotions and not hide behind others. He learned to listen to his body and catch himself before acting. He learned to, as he put it, ”center myself in a spirit of patience, respect, peace, love and empathy for what the other person is feeling.”   ’It has to be hopeful’ Today Dylan sees himself as a better man. He went on to work in the field of social justice, dedicating his time to the protection of women. And he volunteers with Men Stopping Violence.  He says he’s had healthy relationships and is in one now.  He calls Isabelle his best friend. That gives her pause. She cares for him deeply, sees him as a sort of brother and believes that he’s grown and changed. She doesn’t believe for a second that he would hurt another woman. But best friend? Sometimes she feels that way other times she struggles to go that far.  ”I forgave that day because I choose to forgive,” she says. ”But some of my life got stolen.” She’s proud of his success, the career he’s built, but knows    in some ways    she paid for it. He wouldn’t be doing what he’s doing, after all, if he hadn’t abused her and found his way to Men Stopping Violence.  For her, the ripple effects still linger. Call it PTSD.  If a man takes her arm unexpectedly, she flinches. A critical comment, no matter how small, can set her back to a different time. A scream, even at a television during a football game, might leave her rattled.  While he can cut out the ugly details of the past, she doesn’t feel she can. This old relationship still shapes how she relates to men, no matter all the therapy she’s had. Her radar is on for bad things to come, and sometimes she worries that she’ll miss the signs. When a man says something nice to her, she may wonder if she’s being manipulated. She doesn’t love as freely. But she also emerged on the other side empowered in new ways. She isn’t afraid to stand up for herself. She’s strong enough to know she’d rather be alone than mistreated.  Isabelle is only willing to share her part of the journey because she wants women to see their value. She wants to give hope to those in unhealthy or dangerous relationships.  ”I want our story to encourage women to get out    and men to get help,” she says. ”It has to be hopeful. Otherwise I’d rather keep this chapter in the past.”  She knows there are those who can’t understand the friendship she’s built with Dylan. Cutting ties, though, isn’t easy when there’s history.  Isabelle will be the first to admit that letting Dylan into her life was a gamble. But she chooses to see the good in him. And she knows he’s unusual. He’s taken responsibility. He’s accountable. He is so in tune with the patterns of men that she benefits from his advice. ”It’s like getting counseling without paying for it,” she says. And she’s not afraid to dole out her own feedback to keep him in line.  ”I found my voice,” she says, ”and he learned to listen.” Glimmer of understanding, The story of Dylan and Isabelle moves me. It also terrifies me. They are beyond unique that’s clear. I mean, how many men who’ve battered really go on to build a career dedicated to protecting women? How many women who’ve been abused can safely befriend their abuser?  I lose sleep wondering if it’s too good to be true.  It’s a Friday afternoon when I stroll in to the DeKalb County Courthouse for a reality check. Around me are men who’ve recently been arrested for misdemeanor charges related to domestic violence. They are only here because the court made them show up at this afternoon class as a condition for bond. No one is happy to be here. Some are outwardly mad. What about when you’ve got a woman beating on you? What if a girl likes it and puts up with it? I don’t like the idea of getting locked up for something I didn’t do. What if she wanted to get me in trouble and knew if she called the cops the system would be on her side? These questions are tossed at the facilitators of ”Tactics  Choices,” offered by Men Stopping Violence. They have a little more than three hours to engage men, shift thinking and, hopefully, protect women. If they’re lucky, some of these men will later land in their   course, the type that helped Dylan. ”I know we don’t live with angels. I know we don’t live with saints,” a teacher says. ”But the only person in the world I can control is myself.”  The conversation is steered toward the importance of building partnerships based on respect and equality. Men are reminded that if a relationship isn’t healthy for them, they should get out. This talk about equality, though, doesn’t fly with everyone. If I make more money, then I have the last word.  We are designed to fill certain roles in relationships. It’s biblical. Why is man’s role being so feminized? In a minute, we’re all going to be wearing dresses.  I want to learn how to be successful in a relationship without being sensitive. ”I want you to hear this: The world is changing,” warns an instructor. ”Begin to change your thinking, renew your mind, grow into a new possibility.” During the last hour of the course, as instructors guide the men through exercises, I see a few light bulbs go off    but I wonder, once they leave the room and return to their environments, will the glimmer of understanding fade? Can they, like Dylan, give change a chance? Or will they walk the path they’ve already traveled and abuse again? And, most pressing to me, how many Isabelles will suffer in their wakes? ",-1.0
"Donald Trump, Aleppo, Golden Globes: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Top Republican leaders in Congress are setting up a stark confrontation with   Donald Trump by backing an investigation into Russian hacking during the election. “The Russians are not our friends,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, above. Hillary Clinton’s campaign called for all information about the meddling to be declassified. Mr. Trump is expected to announce on Tuesday that he has chosen Exxon Mobil chief Rex. W. Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, rejecting bipartisan concern that he has forged a   relationship with Vladimir V. Putin, the president of Russia. _____ 2. China returned fire at Mr. Trump over his questioning of the   U. S. policy to recognize to Taiwan as part of “one China. ” A   tabloid said his grasp of foreign policy was “like a child. ” Our reporter analyzed five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration. _____ 3. One effect of Mr. Trump’s victory is playing out in abortion politics. In Ohio, an emboldened Republican statehouse passed two abortion bills  —   including one that could ban the procedure as early as six weeks, which is before many women even know they are pregnant. And people on both sides of the debate agree that there’s a possibility Roe v. Wade could be overturned during the Trump presidency. _____ 4. In Syria, Aleppo is falling. The forces of President Bashar   are within days, if not hours, of capturing the last corners of the country’s largest city. The seizure would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government rule in all major cities and forcing the opposition to reckon with whether the armed rebellion has failed. _____ 5. Some of the world’s richest men  —   Microsoft’s Bill Gates, above, Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos  —   joined other global business leaders to launch a fund that would invest more than $1 billion in “next generation energy technologies. ” And investors who control more than $5 trillion in assets have agreed to drop some or all of their fossil fuel stocks. The divestment movement has doubled in size in 15 months. _____ 6. In courts across the U. S.   offenders can get a chance to avoid the devastating consequences of a criminal record, taking classes and doing community service through a program called diversion. But our   examination found that in many places, only people with money could afford the fees to secure that second chance. Above, Marcy Willis, who struggled but is now just $25 from a clean record. _____ 7. About one in six American adults reported taking psychiatric drugs, according to a new analysis. And researchers say an increasing number of infants in the rural U. S. are born   largely to mothers on opioids.

"Your genes play a role in when you lose your virginity.  (CNN) How old were you when you lost your virginity? Or maybe you haven’t reached that point yet. Either way, whether you’re 16 or 40 when you decide to have sex for the first time, you may think the choice comes down to your partner, the people around you and the environment you are exposed to. That’s part of it    but scientists are increasingly realizing that your genes also have something to do with it. Your genetic coding helps define the timing of that milestone moment, as well as when you first have children    and how many you have    as well as your actual functioning during sex. ”It’s clear genes are an important factor,” said John Perry, a geneticist at the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge. ”People think it’s all  .”  But it’s not. Perry acknowledges that factors such as social environment, family structure, peer pressure, culture and religious influences can all affect the age when someone starts having sex. ”You don’t need to be a scientist to know that,” he said. But he believes that these behaviors have an underlying heritability. ”There are core biological pathways underpinning what we believe is mostly societal and cultural,” he said. To back up this belief, Perry’s team recently conducted a study in which they analyzed the genes of more than 125, 000 people whose personal data are stored in the UK Biobank, a health resource containing blood, urine and saliva samples from 500, 000 people ages 40 to 69 from across the country. Data on people’s lives and lifestyles, noted during interviews, are also stored in the Biobank. The genes were analyzed and linked to reproductive milestones, such as the age when people first had sex, the age when they had their first child, how many children they had and, most important, when.  ”We showed that 25% of variability was down to genetics,” Perry said. ”So genes do play a significant role in your reproductive behavior.” The remaining 75% was down to nurture, so it’s not all nature, but the study found 38 gene regions in the body’s genetic makeup that contributed to these life moments. Risk, behavior and puberty, People’s genes do not directly decide actions such as losing virginity, but they do determine aspects of life that could influence when someone chooses to have sex, such as when they reach puberty and become sexually mature. This was another feature of Perry’s study. ”We demonstrated that earlier puberty had a causal impact on the age at which you have first sex,” he said. Earlier puberty was also found to be associated with when people first had children as well as the level of education they reached. ”You can speculate that if you mature earlier, your priorities may change,” he said, suggesting it may become harder to concentrate in school. One of the genes found to be linked to having sex earlier, called CADM2, is thought to influence someone’s likelihood of taking risks, as well as other factors, and was linked to having more children. Another gene, MSRA, is linked to irritability and was seen to result in people losing their virginity later. ”Most human traits have a genetic underpinning,” Perry said. But it’s the combinations of these traits that come together to decide when you take the plunge for a milestone like sex, and as with anything, it’s complicated. ”People think a gene will cause a risk, but it doesn’t,” said Perry. ”It just puts you at higher risk.” ”It is a great study,” said Andrea Burri, associate professor at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Burri’s own research focuses on the genetic aspects of sexual health and chronic pain, including sexual dysfunction. ”It’s fascinating how (this) can be used to untangle what actually influences complex human behaviors,” she said.  Her own studies have found a similar degree of involvement, from 28% to 48% for heritability playing a role in sexual anxiety and dysfunction.  Reducing the risks    and stigma, Burri added that this insight should be used purely as a knowledge base and, if anything, could be used to destigmatize and change attitudes toward sexual behavior by showing how variable people can be at their core.  ”Sometimes, you don’t chose [how] to be and have the preferences that you do, but actually there is    to a certain extent    a biological component,” she said, and differences among people are ”normal.”  The insight could also be used to inform other areas of public health, according to Perry, including addressing lifestyle factors that contribute to earlier ages of puberty, such as obesity and poor nutrition. ”[These] contribute to earlier puberty timing,” Perry said. ”[And] if earlier puberty puts you on a riskier trajectory, reducing anything causing that will be of benefit.”",-1.0
"Putin bigger threat than ISIS: Soros. Russian President Vladimir Putin represents a greater threat to the European Union (EU) than ISIS, according to George Soros. Writing for Project Syndicate, Soros said that Putin's goal is to ""foster the EU's disintegration, and the best way to do so is to flood Europe with Syrian refugees."" Desribing Putin as a ""gifted tactician, but not a strategic thinker,"" Soros went on to explain that while there was no reason to think that the Russian leader became involved in Syria to intensify Europe's refugee crisis, once he ""saw the opportunity to hasten the EU's disintegration, he seized it."" Russia and the EU were in a race against time to see who would collapse first. Attacks from jihadi terrorists, while terrifying, did not compare with the threat ""emanating from Russia"", Soros said.

"Poetry Behind Bars: The Lines That Save Lives — Sometimes Literally. The way Jimmy Santiago Baca tells it, poetry saved his life  —   but he’s not speaking in hyperbole. Long before the poet won an American Book Award, Baca was in prison on a drug conviction, where he was facing down a   fight with another inmate. Baca sought padding however he could get it. ”So I got a bunch of tape and a bunch of books on the library cart and strapped them around my stomach,” he recalls, ”and when this guy pulled out his shank, I was like, wow, this ain’t just a fight  —   this guy wants to kill me.” The guy he was fighting connected on a few swipes, he says, but each time, the books  —   and one big one, in particular  —   took the blow. ”Had the book not been there, I would have been dead it would’ve cut all the way to the tailbone. When i went back to my cell, I looked at this one book where he had gouged it about an inch deep. And it was a thick anthology of Romantic poets.” William Wordsworth, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley  —   ”I thought, ’Wow, you guys saved my life!’ ” ”That’s when I sat down on the cot in my cell and started looking at this book that saved my life and realized that these poets had in a very real, real way saved me,” he says. ”And when I began to read the words, I was astounded by their beauty and eloquence, and how the arrangement of words made me happy.” It’s no coincidence, then, that these days  —   decades after that prison term  —   Baca serves as the final judge in a contest designed to encourage some of the country’s youngest prisoners to turn to poetry themselves. He hopes poetry, that vessel of a million meanings that saved his own life, may do the same for them. ’Children Of Whitman’ Words Unlocked  —   an annual poetry curriculum and competition launched in 2013 by the Center for Educational Excellence in Alternative Settings  —   draws submissions from students in juvenile correctional centers across the country. Poets in facilities from Alaska to Florida have sent in their work this year, according to CEEAS Director David Domenici, and the number of submissions has reached 1, 000 and counting. Baca hasn’t gotten a look at this year’s poems yet he won’t make his selection until a crew of other judges, led by Christy   first whittle that number to just 10 or 15 finalists. But this isn’t his first experience with the contest. He judged last year’s crop, as well. ”Last year, when Christy sent me the submissions, I was just blown away by the high standards of the writing, and by the depth of emotion that was expressed in the poems,” he says. ”You would think that they were all the spawn children of Whitman or something!” Though this year’s contest hasn’t been decided yet, several of the young poets did record their entries for All Things Considered. And while NPR does not have permission to use their names, their voices give life to the words they’ve put to paper  —   which you can listen to via the audio links on this post. Baca believes these poems will serve them well on the outside. ”Literacy is probably the foremost resource that they need to become successful human beings. To be able to deal with sorrow, joy, loneliness and isolation, the first step is that you have to be able to put your feelings into words  —   and you have to share those words with people,” he says. ”If you can write this out and give it to society, it’s going to allow them to take the blinders off and see what’s really going on with you in your life. They’re going to begin to understand what’s really going on in your heart. So let’s give them this gift.” And that gift, like Baca’s story, may be more than a metaphor. The poets recognized by the contest will be included in an anthology of their own  —   not unlike that poetry anthology that Baca says saved him.",-0.5
"The Handmaid’s Tale is timely. But that’s not why it’s so terrifying. When Hulu released a trailer for their adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian classic The Handmaid’s Tale, some conservatives didn’t realize the series was based on a   novel  —   they thought it was created in response to Trump’s presidential win. The confusion makes some sense. Much of the show feels familiar in today’s political climate: children being wrenched from their parents’ arms at borders. A lesbian tortured in order, she’s told, to cure her unnatural appetites. Women forced to carry pregnancies after they’ve been raped. But what makes The Handmaid’s Tale so terrifying is not that it’s timely, but that it’s timeless. And after watching seven episodes, what’s been keeping me up at night isn’t the explicit horrors as much as how the show surfaces women’s fear of what everyday sexism really means. Before the handmaid era has been ushered in by a coup d’état, for example, Moss and her friend Moira (played by Samira Wiley) are called “fucking sluts” by a cashier at a coffee shop for no real reason. It’s as if the man, who seems to know about the impending government shift, is finally free to say whatever he wants to women  —   a misogynist troll empowered. (A sobering thought in any time, but even more so in the wake of the news that one New Hampshire politician got his start on Reddit forums calling for an end to women’s autonomy.) There’s violence and sexual assault to spare, but it’s the milquetoast misogynists that feel more familiar: the boss who offers a meek apology when he’s forced to   female employees at a publishing company the soldier who holds door open for the women as they file out of their workplace, knowing they’ll never return the “commander” who allows his handmaid to read a   fashion magazine so he can feel benevolent. It’s a creeping sort of sexism that American women are   familiar with  —   the kind that pats you on the head instead of on the ass. Like Atwood’s book, the series makes clear that personal anxiety about masculinity underpins this world’s politics  —   it’s forbidden to suggest that men could ever be infertile, for example, and women are banned from reading lest intellectual pursuits distract them from childbearing. Even   men fall into patriarchal traps: when Moss’s character  —   before she’s forced to become a handmaid  —   is panicking because women’s bank accounts across the country have been emptied and passed on to their closest male relative, her husband responds by assuring her that he will “take care of” her. It’s an empty promise that misses the point entirely. The world is crashing down around her, and her husband can only offer words of comfort that exalt his power. And that’s what makes the series  —   and sexism  —   so scary. It’s not just that we live in a country where politicians call pregnant women ‘hosts’ and the   refuses to dine alone with women. It isn’t just that we can’t trust the government to treat us as full human beings  —   it’s that oftentimes we don’t know if we can trust the men in our lives, either. Because as much as The Handmaid’s Tale is about what happens when some men’s disdain for women boils over, it’s also about the danger of “good” men’s apathy and attachment to the privileges sexism affords them. Both are horrors women know well.",-0.5

"Paul Krugman Is Nearly Always Wrong - Breitbart. Paul Krugman,   opinion page editorialist for the New York Times and professor of (macro) economics at NYU, is really nothing more than a limousine liberal, champagne hatchet man for the Clinton’s.  He should be seen for what he is, the most vocal supporter of Hillary for President. He goes out of his way in offending Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, calling both of them “delusional”. Krugman has himself become very accomplished at one thing, namely:  . Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize in economic science in 2008 for his earlier work on trade theory. He actually served in a junior position briefly on the Reagan Council of Economic Advisors  —   something he often hides. Nowadays, he is a leftist puppet that no longer uses economic science, preferring instead, inflammatory rhetoric. Krugman has been decidedly wrong about the 1990s where very little shared prosperity was generated. He has been wrong about supply side feedbacks and about the benefits of globalization (unless you believe in the elevation of China’s development). He selectively chooses statistics (liars figure) instead of admitting that there has in fact been no boom for ordinary people. The numbers show that wages were flat in the 1990s for the bottom 90 percent of the US population and the whole thing died in 2001 in the dotcom crash, wiping out the supposed investment boom. I know too well, as I lost my shirt. Those numbers have stagnated ever since or declined. That’s Dr. K’s model: pontificate as a learned bearded economist, when in truth you are nothing more than a shrill whore for the liberal establishment. His solution for every problem is the same, raise taxes and have the federal government borrow yet more debt. Twenty trillion is not enough for Paul, the ultimate proponent for spending our hard earned money on wasteful boondogles and giveaways. So condescending, Krugman has become a snide polemist that has given up on reason and economic argument. He is not an academic who uses objective factuality any longer but instead, is these days, a know it all —  who knows very little. Please recall however during the 2008 campaign, that the same Dr. Krugman hit on then candidate Barrack Obama, calling him a “hero of venom and a “cult of personality. ” He has seriously been the Clinton’s bagman of ideas  —   forever. Krugman is primarily interested in only one cult, his own. His overt biases make him both academically questionable and scientifically discredited. He gave a lecture in Oxford last year on the condition that no one could challenge his positions. Really this is academe? What kind of academy does Krugman need where everyone pays obeisance? However, at FreedomFest when he debated Steve Moore (from the Wall Street Journal, for a boatload of money) he lost. Krugman is nothing more than an establishment ventriloquist in a cushy leather academic library chair paid for by some innocent donor who has been robbed. He has never run anything, served in a corporation or managed a profit  loss statement effecting real employees or been judged by the bottom line. Yet this windbag is given a perch weekly in a notable newspaper to knock Trump because he lacks “management skills. “ How would he know? For Krugman success in business does not equal economic success. Admittedly, “partisan “ Krugman makes the constant statement that Democrats perform better without looking at the full set of statistics that disprove his slanted judgment. Calling people ignorant blowhards “ is not the same as disproving their arguments or denying real facts. Why do people like Krugman run down accomplished entrepreneurs like Trump, among others, who use the market and their considerable skills to extol not only the virtues of democratic capitalism but who demonstrate its beneficial effects on everyone in the value chain  —   from vendors and employees to communities and charities? The reason in a single word, actually a deadly vice, is: envy. Krugman states this proposition: CEOs don’t know anything about running a national economy, which is nothing like running a business. “ Running the economy demands a macroeconomist, the likes of Krugman. Only such Keynesian wisdom and econometric modeling can comprehend the contours of this tangled global system. And they have done so well after all. To quote Krugman, “The truth is that the idea that Donald Trump, of all people, knows how to run the US economy is ludicrous. ” Well, the only thing more ludicrous is that Krugman and his crony capitalist Goldman Sachs pony, Hillary Clinton would be more qualified. Krugman claims, as his book and column suggest, that he is, “the conscience of liberalism. ” It might be better stated that he is the prophet of more and more government intervention and the precise reason that the Left is failing. He and his ilk are, to steal a now familiar phrase, the culprits for why America is crippled. In my humble opinion, Professor Krugman should be stripped of his Nobel Prize (which comes from dirty money resulting from the less than noble Nobel family funds gained through the manufacture of gunpowder —  hardly a liberal icon). But we should give him a new Prize —  The Clinton Prize  —   for crony and criminal capitalism. This haut arrogant intellectual of modest origins, whose family escaped the pogroms of Belarus in the last century, has grossly misled the modern American public for decades. He is disconnected from the everyman. He has failed to tell the truth about his dogma of globalism. A   Panglossian, he is the very source of American demise. It’s time the New York crowd stopped giving him credit and instead called him what he is: Wrong.

" A University Sued Its Own Student Newspaper And Won.  A Kentucky judge has denied a student newspaper’s request to get ahold of documents related to claims that a professor sexually assaulted and harassed graduate students in a   case that tested a federal privacy law. In August, the University of Kentucky sued the school’s independent student newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, after the state’s attorney general ruled that the university must release documents related to an investigation into the allegations against entomology professor James Harwood. In a decision Monday, Judge Thomas Clark, of Fayette County Circuit Court, agreed with the university that even releasing redacted records  —   without the names of victims or witnesses, or details of the alleged assaults or harassment, as the Kernel requested  —   would leave people involved vulnerable to identification, violating federal privacy laws for students. The Kernel “will absolutely be appealing this decision,” the paper’s    Marjorie Kirk, told BuzzFeed News. “What’s at stake here is much bigger than just one professor and one university’s interests,” she said. In December 2015, Harwood was accused of sexual harassment by two graduate students and two months later resigned his tenured position amid a university investigation. In March, a Kernel staff member submitted a records request for documents related to the claims against Harwood after getting a tip about the case. “What’s at stake here is much bigger than just one professor and one university’s interests. ” According to the Kernel and court filings, Harwood’s accusers wanted to publicize the case because they were upset that Harwood was allowed to resign and continue receiving his $107, 000 salary until Aug. 31, 2016. Harwood also was allowed to keep his medical benefits until the end of last year. Under terms of his resignation, Harwood did not admit wrongdoing, and the university agreed not to disclose information about the investigation to Harwood’s future potential employers. The university’s lawsuit kicked off a battle between President Eli Capilouto and the Kernel that divided activists on campus. Some agreed with the university that the documents should be withheld to preserve the victims’ privacy, but others argued disclosure would protect other possible victims. The victims originally voiced support for the newspaper, but came out in favor of the school’s position in September. Other universities in Kentucky tried to put responses to records requests on hold pending the case’s outcome. University of Kentucky attorneys said in court that releasing documents showing students’ majors, advisers, projects, or the date of the alleged assaults and harassment all “make it possible for the Googlers or the Facebook nerds” to find out victims’ names. Judge Clark ruled the records contained too much personal information about the complainants to be effectively redacted, violating the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The university repeatedly blamed the Kernel’s reporting for a drop in students seeking help from the school’s Violence Intervention and Prevention Center to deal with sexual assault incidents. Ashley Rigby, the head of that center, said in a video put out by the university Tuesday morning that students who did seek help specifically worried about their cases becoming public without their consent. Capilouto in a video released by the school similarly said he hoped the ruling would cause reporting to increase due to a new sense of confidentiality. But some experts disagree. “We’re seeing that tactic quite a bit  —   that universities are trying to make secrecy all about the interest of the victim, when in fact it’s almost always motivated by the university’s desire to conceal,” Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, told BuzzFeed News. Going forward, Capilouto said the university will ask potential faculty hires to answer whether they were involved in a sexual misconduct case at their previous institutions.   ",-1.0

If you come from Chile, Argentina, Brazil, or any other Latin American nation, the most striking thing about Jeffrey Goldberg’s interview with Henry Kissinger is the absence of your vast corner of the world. This should shock no one. Since September 11, 2001, Latin America has been noticeably absent from the U. S.   agenda. President Barack Obama acknowledged as much in a conversation with Goldberg published in The Atlantic last April, to which Kissinger is now responding. Not even the increasing presence of China, whose commerce with Latin America grew at a dizzying 31. 2 percent per year from 2000 to 2011, managed to draw U. S. attention to the continent, once considered “America’s backyard. ” Not that this seemingly diminutive moniker gives much cause for resentment. During this decade, the region enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, with annual GDP growing at about double the pace of the previous one, and poverty plunging from 44 percent in 2003 to 29 percent in 2015, in part thanks to the new partnership with China. The Lessons of Henry Kissinger, And yet, it’s not the   Latin America, nor the region’s future, that should have compelled an appearance in Goldberg’s Kissinger conversation, but, rather, the past. As part of America’s chess game with the Soviets during the Cold War, Kissinger, as secretary of state and national security advisor to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, became an unflinching supporter and, at least in the case of Chile,   of the coups d’etat and military dictatorships that spread throughout South America in the 1970s. Tens of thousands of people were tortured and killed in clandestine camps, their bodies dumped from planes into rivers, their children stolen and given away under false identities. In his book The Trial of Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens argued convincingly that Kissinger deserved prosecution “for war crimes, for crimes against humanity, and for offenses against common or customary or international law, including conspiracy to commit murder, kidnap, and torture. ” Kissinger also disagrees with Obama that America should ever have to justify its actions, as he suggests in the Goldberg interview. While Latin America largely took a back seat to the rest of the world through the Obama years, some of his administration’s most monumental late additions to his legacy occurred in the region. Obama decided to bring the Cold War to a formal (and long overdue) end this year. He   diplomatic relationships with Cuba and visited the island he sent an official envoy to Havana to back the peace negotiations between Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). As part of the same attempt at closure, in March, on the 42nd anniversary of the military coup that gave birth to the cruelest of the several dictatorships Argentina suffered through in the 20th century, Obama visited a memorial to the “disappeared,” the thousands kidnapped, tortured, and killed by the military in Buenos Aires during the   dictatorship, which seized power thanks, in part, to the support of the United States. “Democracies have to have the courage to acknowledge when we don’t live up to the ideals that we stand for,” he said, falling short of a full apology. “And we’ve been slow to speak out for human rights, and that was the case here. ” Days before Obama’s trip, his administration announced the declassification of U. S. diplomatic, intelligence, and defense documents containing information about Argentina’s years under military dictatorship. Last August, Secretary of State John Kerry handed over the first batch during a meeting with President Mauricio Macri. The documents were, in fact, part of the Carter Library’s collection, and contained few revelations —  the intelligence and defense documents which might, or might not, offer new insight about the U. S. role in the coup are still under declassification review. However, three of the diplomatic cables provided by Kerry brought Kissinger’s role back to the fore. In a memo from 1976, we learned of a meeting only two days after the coup, in which Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America William Rogers warned   of State Kissinger “to expect a fair amount of repression, probably a good deal of blood, in Argentina before too long. ” The new dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla, Rogers warned, would “have to come down very hard not only on the terrorists but on the dissidents of trade unions and their parties. ” Kissinger replied, “Whatever chance they have, they will need a little encouragement . .. because I do want to encourage them. I don’t want to give the sense that [the dictatorship is being] harassed by the United States. ” The next day, the International Monetary Fund released $127 million in credit for Argentina’s new government. Gerald Ford, under whom Kissinger would also serve, also approved $49 million in security aid for the new government. In another document from June of that year, Kissinger urged the junta to act faster to establish government authority, before U. S. opposition to its human rights violations gained momentum. “If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly,” he advised. Even after he left the U. S. government, Kissinger’s shadow loomed over Argentina. In one cable from 1978, Raúl Castro, the U. S. ambassador to Argentina, wrote, “My only concern is that Kissinger’s repeated high praise for Argentina’s action in wiping out terrorism may have gone to some considerable extent to this hosts’ heads. ” Kissinger, as a private citizen, was in Argentina as a guest of Videla’s for the World Cup. Members of the Carter administration were putting pressure on the junta to cease with the disappearances of tens of thousands of dissidents. Castro, horrified by the bloodbath taking place in Argentina, worried that “Kissinger’s laudatory statements” might be used (as they were) by the military junta as “justification for hardening their human rights stance. ” We don’t know if it is Chile, Argentina, or Vietnam that Kissinger has in mind when, in an answer to Goldberg about the usefulness of mea culpas about “past American behavior,” Kissinger asks, “Should every American public servant have to be worried about how his views will sound 40 years later in the hands of foreign governments? Is every foreign government entitled to a file verified by the U. S. government decades after an event?” I wonder if the question here should, in fact, have been what happens when a public servant has no fear of being held accountable for his or her views and actions in the future? In Kissinger’s view, ethics and morality are desirable only as long as they don’t become a nuisance. “When the charge of war criminal becomes an accepted form of discourse,” he laments, “the prospects of national cohesion disintegrate. Diplomacy loses its flexibility and strategy its force. ” Putting any moral considerations aside, if that is even possible, Kissinger seems to dismiss what is usually referred to as “international public opinion,” which the Obama administration has always appeared so eager to engage. “Foreign countries don’t judge us by the propensity of our president to traduce his own country on their soil,” Kissinger lectures Obama in the interview. “They assess such visits on the basis of the fulfillment of expectations more than the recasting of the past. ” In that, after all, he might be right. Today, with China’s, and its own, economy faltering, Latin America finds itself as divided and polarized as the United States about what to do and whom to blame. One faction looks at its Northern neighbor with mistrust, rancor, even hostility the other, admiring and sympathetic, longs for its approval and protection. To their common chagrin, they both encounter the same American indifference.",-0.5
"IDC data showed OPPO shipments grew 137 percent on-year to ship 23 million smartphones in April-June. Growth in the global smartphone market is starting to cool after a frenetic few years, but a little-known Chinese smartphone maker, OPPO, is making heads turn. OPPO shipped 22.6 million smartphones in the April-June quarter, a 136.6 percent increase from a year ago, data from research company International Data Corporation (IDC) released on Thursday showed Based on the latest IDC numbers, OPPO held a global market share of 6.6 percent at the end of the second quarter, making it the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in the world, ahead of famed brands Xiaomi, and Lenovo, which owns Motorola. ""Technology is so important to us,"" Michael Tran, director of OPPO Mobile Australia, told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Friday. ""We are listening to our consumers and what they want in the devices, and designing the products based on [that]."" One of OPPO's focus was on the camera technology installed in its phones. For example, one of its popular smartphone models, the ""R9"", boasts a 16 megapixel front-facing camera, with various light settings and noise-reduction technology, to appeal to users who enjoy taking ""selfies."" ""We are investing into research and development for our camera technology,"" said Tran. ""We want to be known as the camera phone."" OPPO, along with another little-known Chinese smartphone maker, vivo, pushed both Lenovo and Xiaomi out of IDC's top five smartphone vendors by shipment in the first quarter of 2016. Shipments for vivo grew 80.2 percent on-year in the second quarter to 16.4 million units. Globally, IDC said smartphone vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the April-June period, up just 0.3 percent on-year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, however, shipments climbed 3.1 percent. Aggressive marketing and advertising for OPPO's flagship ""R9"" phone helped to boost sales in the quarter, IDC said. [OPPO] continued to leverage its strength in Tier 3 to Tier 5 cities in China, which significantly contributed to growth, according to IDC. In a separate report released Wednesday, Strategy Analytics said OPPO was also expanding rapidly into foreign geographies in Asia, such as India, and other emerging markets. Despite its promising prospect, OPPO has a long way to go to catch up with market leader Samsung, which shipped 77 million handsets in the second quarter and had a market share of 22.4 percent, thanks to the popularity of its latest flagship ""Galaxy S7"" and ""S7 edge"" models. Second-placed Apple shipped 40.4 million handsets for the same period, holding 11.8 percent of the market, with users likely delaying their purchase to the next quarter when a new iPhone model is expected to be released. Huawei, which recently said its smartphone shipments for the first half of the year jumped 25 percent on-year, shipped out 32.1 million units between April-June, according to IDC data, and had a 9.4 percent share of the market. On a more positive note, Strategy Analytics' Linda Sui said in the Wednesday report there are ""emerging signs that the global smartphone market has reached a bottom in the first half of 2016."" ""The growth outlook for the second half of this year is brighter due to multiple big new product launches from Samsung, Apple and others,"" said Sui. — Follow CNBC International on and Facebook.",0.0
"China reveals deadly vaccine sales ring, hunts 300 suspects, doctor arrested. Chinese authorities are hunting 300 people suspected of illegally selling deadly, spoiled vaccines, in what could be the country's biggest case of its kind. Late on Friday authorities issued a public notice of the identities of the suspects, who are thought to have been involved a vaccine trading ring worth as much as 570 million yuan ($88 million), state media reported. The authorities called on the public to help track down the dealers involved, the reports said. According to Xinhua News Agency, the suspects sold compromised vaccines, which were neither adequately refrigerated for storage nor transported in approved conditions, to hospitals and disease control centers in at least 24 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, where they were used over a number of years The vaccines had the potential to cause disability or death, Xinhua reported. The reports said that although the case was not made public until Friday, the illegal operation was first discovered in April 2015. Since then, the police had made over 20 raids across the country to confiscate unsafe products and had arrested a former doctor only identified by her surname, Pang, as well as her daughter, a medical school graduate, in eastern China's Shandong Province, the reports said. The women had profited from the illegal sale of vaccines since early 2010, the State Public Security Bureau alleged. The duo are accused of purchasing 25 types of vaccines from more than 100 pharmaceutical salesmen, both licensed and unlicensed, then selling them on to illegal agents as well as local medical facilities at higher prices. So far, authorities have been unable to work out precisely what quantity of compromised vaccine entered the market, media reports said. The vaccines the suspects allegedly sold included ones used against chicken pox, rabies, meningitis and hepatitis A, none of which are mandatory injections in the mainland. Thepaper.com, the digital news outlet that first broke the story, reported that Pang, 47, had worked as a doctor at a public hospital but in 2009 was given a three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, after she was convicted of illegally selling vaccines worth almost five million yuan ($763,358). Angry Chinese asked on social media why the case was only revealed almost a year after police had solid evidence that unsafe vaccines had been widely used, and how the justice system had allegedly allowed the former doctor to commit the same crime twice. China is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets but also the biggest producer of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, according to a report by the London-based International Policy Network. Plagued by drug scandals, Beijing has ramped up its policing of the drug sector and called on hospitals and clinics to improve transparency on their drug purchases. However, the crackdown, which includes more severe punishments for the production and sale of fake or substandard pharmaceuticals, so far appears to have had little impact.

"Riccardo Tisci Leaves Givenchy: What It Means - The New York Times. Yet another seismic shift is taking place in French fashion. Riccardo Tisci, the creative director of Givenchy and the designer responsible for redefining the brand Audrey Hepburn built for the Kardashian era, said on Thursday that he was leaving the brand after 12 years. A successor has not been announced. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French conglomerate that owns Givenchy, said in a statement, “The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the House of Givenchy represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution. ” Designer moves have become so common of late they are starting to seem more   than critical. (A brief list of departures, since 2015, include Raf Simons from Dior, Hedi Slimane from Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz from Lanvin, Alexander Wang from Balenciaga, Consuelo Castiglioni from Marni and, as of last Monday, Clare Waight Keller from Chloé.) But Mr. Tisci’s amicable divorce from Givenchy, rumors of which WWD reported on last month, could have deeper repercussions. Mr. Tisci had, after all, not only transformed Givenchy into one of LVMH’s most successful brands, but was often held up as a model for the partnership between hot young designer and heritage house. That he was willing to end what appeared to be a happy marriage suggests that the old days of designers staying in place for decades (Karl Lagerfeld has been at Chanel since 1983) may be finally, officially, over. Linda Fargo, senior vice president for fashion and store presentation at Bergdorf Goodman, said, “I guess destabilization is the new normal. ” When Mr. Tisci joined Givenchy in 2005 the brand was floundering after being led by a quick series of creative directors, including John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald. In an interview with The Financial Times in 2011, Marco Gobbetti, the former chief executive of Givenchy, said the brand was “a mess, without an identity. ” And Mr. Tisci was a    upstart Italian with a gothic sensibility who had barely started his own line. It seemed a surprising match, but Mr. Tisci managed to combine his own   sensibility with a certain French classicism and a dose of emotion to give Givenchy a newfound relevance: He made crosses, skulls and the perfect white shirt make sense. Mr. Tisci was also an early adopter of social media, cognizant of the power that those platforms and influencers would have on fashion. He has 1. 8 million followers on Instagram, and many of his famous friends appear in his posts as often as they do in the front row of his shows. LVMH, which also has brands such as Louis Vuitton, Céline and Fendi in its portfolio, does not break down the performance of individual maisons in its financial results. But the number of employees at Givenchy has more than tripled since Mr. Tisci joined the house in 2005, and sales revenue is believed to have grown to around 500 million euros ($539 million) annually. There are now 72   stores worldwide (compared with seven in 2005) with a Rome flagship set to open this year, and plans for a London store are underway for next year. Last week, LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, posted record revenue and profits for 2016, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe and a pickup in demand in Asia. “Riccardo has accomplished everything a designer can do for a brand, clocking a very respectable tenure and creating a fully realized language for them,” Ms. Fargo said. So, why leave? Mr. Tisci said in his statement, “I now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions. ” But rumors have suggested he may be headed to Versace. It would mean going home to Italy, and to a brand whose unabashed Italian sex and   aesthetic mirrors his own. And Mr. Tisci is close to Donatella Versace (he shocked fashion in 2015 when he featured Ms. Versace, at least nominally a rival designer, in a Givenchy ad campaign). Besides, the suggestion, briefly beloved of the industry, that a designer needs a timeout from the increasingly endless show seasons, which was posited when both Mr. Simons and Ms. Waight Keller left their posts, increasingly seems like smoke and mirrors. After Dior, Mr. Simons took an even bigger job at Calvin Klein, and Ms. Waight Keller is said to be moving to a different brand (Givenchy? ). Perhaps this is the answer. Once upon a time, a designer’s name was on the door, and his or her heart was in building a legacy. Now it is rare that any creatives start their own line. Rather, the biggest jobs involve putting their talents at the service of someone else’s already gilded name. That may be an interesting intellectual and creative challenge for a while, but once achieved, it no longer holds the same allure, and the search for the next test begins. “This clearly shows that a lot of folks are about change and evolution, and both designers and brands want to be continually in motion,” said Marc Metrick, president of Saks Fifth Avenue. We tend to romanticize “the designers” and to bestow upon them some sort of mystical, spiritual connection to the houses where they reign, maybe because what they make touches our bodies and can thus transform our lives, maybe because it involves the alchemy of invention or because designers these days have the golden glow of celebrity. But what Mr. Tisci’s move suggests  —   what all of this may reveal  —   is another, more parochial, truth: Being a designer is a job like any other. And people change jobs.   Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, suggested when Frida Giannini was ousted from Gucci in 2014 that 10 years was probably long enough for any designer to stay at a brand, and after that it was good to mix things up (10 years also being the number most often chosen as an ideal tenure for a chief executive). At the time, it seemed like a radical idea. It does not any more.",-1.0
"Ray Lewis Blasts Black Lives Matter for Ignoring Black-on-Black Crime. Former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is excoriating the Black Lives Matter movement for its silence about the rising rates of    crime. [“The things that’s ran in the newspapers have disturbed me,” the ESPN NFL analyst said in an emotional video posted on his Facebook page on April 2.  He said: I’m trying to figure out if black lives really matter, then in Chicago alone the murder rate has soared 72 percent in 2016.   percent in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year. I’m trying to ask the question to an organization of black lives, if they really mattered, then why not riot now? Indeed, as Breitbart News’ Warner Todd Huston reported last week, “According to DNAinfo. com, the first three months of 2016 have seen more shootings than the first three months of any year in over a decade. With 790 shot so far this year, that is over 80 percent higher then the 419 March ended with in 2015. ” In the emotional video posted, Lewis said he is “trying to figure out in [his] mind why no one is paying attention to black men killing black men. ” The    former NFL star, who knows a thing or two about violent   himself, castigated Black Lives Matter for protesting and marching in the streets after a black person is killed by law enforcement, while remaining silent as    murder rates skyrocket. “Why do we always find ourselves half the victims, and now we have the separation once again that we’re being victimized because of one bad white cop, two bad white cops, three bad white cops, killing a young black brother,” Lewis said. “But every day we have    crime killing each other.   …     The March murder rate rose by 29 percent, but we’re not rioting in the streets about black on black killing each other. ” Lewis’ video has garnered more than two million views on Facebook.

"Netflix engineers hacked a brain-controlled interface – TechCrunch. This is pretty much the definition of unnecessary, but then, that’s part of the fun of hack days. A quartet of Netflix designers have given the world “MindFlix,” by way of a short video, highlighting the hack’s use of a the Muse headband to control the movie streaming site’s familiar interface. “Instead of implanting chips in our brain for Hack Day,” the video explains, “we decided to take this brain-reading headband to really put it to the test.” It’s a short video — and a highly edited one. As someone who’s tried out brain wave- and eye-controlled television interfaces, I’ll admit that I’m pretty skeptical about how smoothly the thing actually works. I’ve personally never tried one out that gave me hope that any of this will become a usable option in the near future — let alone a better one than the interfaces that are currently available. But the video and hack are clearly more about fun than developing some future version of media streaming interface. But, as with so much of what technology has given us of late, the technology was developed with the exceptionally lazy in mind. The tongue-in-cheek video attached to the project stars a Netflix user too lazy to go in search of their lost remote control — of course, there’s no solution yet to the issue of what happens when one misplaces their headset. The hack is one of a handful that came out of the Netflix Hack Day. Others include a picture in picture option to see what other profiles tied to your account are watching, a donation feature tied to social conscience films and the hit Netflix series Stranger Things reimagined as an Atari-like video game.",0.0
"Yik Yak is back with a college Slack called Hive – TechCrunch. Yik Yak crashed and burned after raising $73.5 million… then laying off most of its employees as users ditched its anonymous message board app. But now Yik Yak appears to be taking another shot at the college demographic with an app for chatting up people with the same classes, major or interest. Last week, an app called Hive appeared in the app stores. It was built by Richard Guy, Yik Yak’s lead mobile developer, shares the same minty green color scheme and features Yik Yak co-founder Brooks Buffington in its screenshots. Spotted by The Verge and now on Product Hunt, Hive describes itself as “an exclusive social network for your campus. With Hive it’s easier than ever to talk with everyone on campus.” The app appears to let you join chat room “channels” for different classes, majors and interests, plus message directly with specific people. It’s laid out much like Slack with a side drawer full of your different channels. The catch is that the iOS and Android app is only for college kids with .edu email addresses, and right now it’s only open at South Carolina’s Furman University where Yik Yak’s co-founders met. The idea seems to be that if you need help studying for a test, working on a research project or organizing a club, Hive could help. We’ve reached out to Yik Yak for more details about whether this is an official pivot or just a side project, but haven’t heard back. Merging Facebook original sign-up strategy with the messaging trend and Slack’s design is a pretty astute way to create a formula for a viral app. Facebook initially only let users at a few elite colleges join, and one of its core features was the ability to see who was in your classes. The constant usage of chat apps has made them the focal points of the mobile industry. And Slack has proven that simple messaging can unlock deep value from collaboration. Yet Hive lacks the network effect Facebook created by interconnecting users from different schools. The messaging has become swamped with competitors. And Slack’s design works because you’re probably only in a few teams or channels, and all your work is important. Hive’s wide range of channels of unfocused communication could feel noisy and unnecessary. Facebook already has a Groups For Schools product focused around classes. Plus, when students already have a mess of messaging apps, they might be reluctant to join another just for homework tips. Cutting its head count, doubling down on the demographic it understands and building a lean new product is exactly what Yik Yak should have done with its remaining venture capital. But to bounce back to anywhere near the $400 million valuation it reached before its first app crumbled, Yik Yak needs lightning to strike twice — and this time to figure out how to bottle it.",0.0
"For Trump, no qualms in contradicting Obama. Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump isn’t waiting until Inauguration Day to assert his posture on foreign policy, even in areas plainly at odds with the sitting   . On sensitive issues of diplomacy and national security, Trump has displayed a continued willingness to pressure and contradict President Barack Obama, eschewing a ”one president at a time” policy that Obama insists must govern the peaceful transition of power. The most forceful example came Thursday, as diplomats at the United Nations were preparing for a vote in the Security Council on a resolution rebuking Israel for its settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In a morning statement, Trump urged Obama to reject the measure, arguing it ”puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.” The vote was postponed. But at the time Trump’s statement emerged, the Obama administration was still debating whether to abstain and let the measure pass, a gesture that would have been in line with the White House’s vocal objections to settlement activity on lands claimed by the Palestinians. Trump’s team informed Obama administration officials ahead of time they were planning to release the statement, according to Jason Miller, a transition spokesman. A national security spokesman for the White House declined to characterize how the message was received. But administration officials privately say the move, paired with a string of public splits between Trump and Obama, runs afoul of a longstanding custom observed by past incoming presidents to withhold statements or remarks that might be seen as contradictory to the sitting administration and perplex global allies as they await a new   . ”The   clearly is determined to show through any number of moves during the transition that, in effect, there’s going to be a sharp break with the policy toward Israel of his predecessor,” said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a CNN global affairs analyst. ”I think this is unprecedented for a   during a transition to openly oppose an act of diplomacy at the UN in   in an administration,” Miller said. ”It’s remarkable.” Trump’s team respects the one president at a time concept, but that doesn’t mean he will sit back until January 20, his incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on CNN’s ”New Day” Friday morning. ”President Obama and his team have been unbelievably gracious to the   and his team, but at the end of the day, he’s not someone that’s going to sit back and wait,” Spicer said. ”(Trump’s) point was Israel is our closest ally in the Middle East,” Spicer said. ”It is something that we should protect and he wanted to make it very clear that anything that undermined Israel, which is a great friend of the united states, he was going to make sure his voice was heard. and it worked. But look, what is the hit, that he’s been unbelievably successful so far as a  ?” Obama held back from meetings in 2008, During Obama’s own transition to power in 2008, he withheld extensive public comment about flashes of violence in the Middle East and terror attacks in India that occurred as President George W. Bush was concluding his term. Bush’s aides even invited Obama to participate in a Group of 20 meeting held in Washington shortly after he was elected President. Obama’s team    which at the time was developing an economic recovery plan that differed from Bush’s proposals    concluded his presence at the summit could send contradictory signals to global allies. Trump, meanwhile, has shown little signs of concern about sending mixed signals about US policy to overseas allies. He’s offered foreign policy prescriptions on Twitter and in public remarks that differ from Obama’s approach. And he’s claimed to be openly negotiating government contracts before he takes office. This week alone has seen Trump meet with top members of the US military at his Florida estate, followed by a session with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Trump had lambasted the cost of projects those firms are completing for the US government, later claiming credit during a rally for negotiating down the costs of a new presidential aircraft. On Thursday he tweeted the US ”must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,” a break from Obama’s own policy of reducing nuclear weapon stockpiles. Later, a spokesman clarified Trump was referencing ”the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it.” Russia and China, The most glaring divide between the incoming and outgoing administrations: Trump’s stance on Russia, who the US accuses of meddling in the presidential election. Trump has questioned the intelligence that led to that assessment, leading to a combative public spat between his transition team and the White House. Disputes over how to handle China have also emerged. When China seized a US underwater drone in international waters this week, the   responded forcefully on Twitter, including making suggestions to the current administration on how to proceed.  ”We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.  let them keep it!” Trump wrote. The drone was returned earlier this week. The messages came after another diplomatic scuffle prompted by Trump’s phone conversation with the leader of Taiwan, a move that broke decades of US diplomatic precedent and sparked bombast in Beijing. Obama himself brushed off the incident in a press conference last week, indicting that Trump’s move in itself wasn’t necessarily harmful.  But he advised his successor to carefully weigh the consequences of his actions, and insisted that US foreign policy was still under his control for another month. ”What I’ve advised the   is that across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you’re doing it in a systematic, deliberate, intentional way,” Obama said. ”And since there’s only one President at a time, my advice to him has been that before he starts having a lot of interactions with foreign governments other than the usual courtesy calls, that he should want to have his full team in place, that he should want his team to be fully briefed.”",-1.0
"In Austria, Over Half Of All ’Asylum Seekers’ Commit Crimes. A new report on migrant crime reveals that for every 100 people who attempt to claim asylum in Austria an average of 55 criminal offences are committed, with some communities significantly more represented in statistics than others. [The Austrian agency of Federal statistics report shows that during the period of 2004 to 2014 almost every other migrant had committed some kind of criminal offence after coming to the country and seeking asylum.  The majority of the crimes were perpetrated by Algerians, who have been held as responsible for many of the high profile migrant crimes like the mass sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve in Germany. Algerians commit a staggering 155 crimes per 100 asylum seekers, with Georgians close behind at 151 per 100, and Nigerians at 129 per 100, reports Kronen Zeitung. Syrians are presently reasonably low on the list at only around 8 offence per 100 applicants, but the Federal statistics agency says that because the study only covers up to 2014 it doesn’t account for the mass influx of Syrians experienced during 2015. The report also notes 80 per cent of the criminals were young men. While the overall proportion of all crime in Austria committed by what the report identifies as “asylum seekers” was reasonably low  —   around five per cent  —   during the period of the study they only actually made up less than half a per cent of Austria’s total population. This significant over representation in the crime statistics for this group will continue to give concern to Austrian police. Assuming the statistics are correct, one in every two migrants have been suspected of committing crimes. The study did not include whether charges were pressed upon the criminals or whether they were simply released. Criminology experts have said the cause of the high numbers is because of a “lack of prospects” for young migrant men in Austria. Many say the men take high risks coming to Europe and often find themselves indebted to people smugglers who often have ties to organised crime.",1.0
"Teachers in Kentucky hold sick-out over pension bill. Teachers across 26 counties in Kentucky called out sick today forcing jurisdictions to close schools after lawmakers passed a pension bill that prevents state employees from adding accumulated unused sick days to their retirement plans as well as reducing the return on investment on hybrid savings accounts with the state.  Why it matters: The sickout in Kentucky continues a nationwide trend of teachers stepping out of the classroom to fight for improved benefits and salary in their states.  What they're saying: Teachers say the bill came as a surprise to them with very little time to review the bill. Jeni Bolander, a teacher and a member of the Kentucky 120 United group, said that teachers could easily accept the pension plan. However, she said, the plan is harmful to prospective teachers and won't help attract educators to the state.  Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear said he'd be filing suit to stop the bill from becoming law. Beshear said there was no public comment and no fiscal analysis.  Governor Matt Bevin supported the bill, but he has yet to sign it.  Why you'll hear about this again: Schools around Kentucky closed on Friday with teachers calling out sick and it's unclear when they'll return to the classroom. Most schools in the state go on spring break after Easter. ",0.0
"As battle to liberate Mosul plays out, Yazidis hope for healing. Yazidi hostages, sex slaves and even young men brainwashed and conscripted into the   jihadist army are inside the city. And the beleaguered Yazidi community knows those may be the lucky ones. “The most important thing now is the hostages,” Baba Chawish, the highest spiritual authority in the Yazidi community, told FoxNews. com. “There is nothing we can do about the dead. We need to take care of the ones still living. ” Yazidis joined Peshmerga soldiers on the front lines early Monday morning as the civilian exodus began, awaiting the return of familiar faces. According to Haitham   head of military intelligence for the Iraqi Army Emergency Response Division (ERD) the survival of potentially thousands of Yazidi sex slaves is of paramount importance. Locations of many have been identified and plans to ensure safe passage are in place, he said. Yazidis are guarded in their hope. The persecution they suffered for centuries culminated in the rise of ISIS, which made Mosul its Iraqi capital in June of 2014. Two months later, the world watched as the Yazidi villages atop Mount Sinjar were overrun. The community remains skeptical that its members will be given special help or protection by any government. Earlier this year, the U. S. State Department gave the Yazidis the official designation as victims of genocide  —   a designation they say has done nothing to help them. “It hasn’t changed anything. I am on my own, trying to find answers,” one Yazidi man, who asked only to be identified as Omar, told FoxNews. com. He was not at Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014, when ISIS marauded its way into the mountain, slaughtering and capturing Yazidis by the thousands and prompting many more to flee to the top where they died of starvation and exposure. Omar has neither seen nor heard from his 18 closest relatives since that day. Supported from the air by the U. S.  coalition, Kurdish Peshmerga forces liberated Sinjar and the surrounding villages from ISIS occupation last November, yet the region remains largely unlivable and reminiscent of a haunted war zone. The lone road into Sinjar traces the Syrian border, right up into the coiled road mountain, and is still littered with overturned vehicles, strewn clothing and singed belongings.  Some 22 Yazidi mass graves have recently been unearthed in different locales across the mountainside, with many more likely to be discovered in the coming weeks. According to Chawish, there are now over 1, 000 Yazidi orphans and more than 400, 000 of their people remain homeless. Very few are able to return to Sinjar, scores have fled the country as refugees, some are living in displacement camps across the Kurdish region and others are simply finding refuge in abandoned buildings. While many are hopeful the anticipated liberation of Mosul will bring with it some tearful reunions with freed Yazidi survivors, the community is all too aware that their people will need help, both immediate and long term. Driving though an array of ravaged villages in northern Iraq, it is common to see Yazidis seeking shelter wherever possible. In one case, a rundown building  —   where ripped sheets serve as walls  —   had become home to several elderly and disabled Yazidis. One occupant, Murad, 70, painfully reconstructed that scorching summer morning ISIS came for them. He was pushing his wife Guly in her wheelchair to collect water when members of the fearsome terror army opened fire. Unable to run, they were captured along with thousands of others and held prisoner in Mosul. “We were tortured, people died from starvation. They were killing infant babies in front of their mothers,” he told FoxNews. com. “They raped our girls in front of us. I will never forget. ” Guly, previously disabled from what she referred to as a ”brain attack”  —   a stroke  —   said that ISIS fighters threw away her wheelchair when they kidnapped her. In that first brutal winter of captivity, they were left without blankets or protection from the elements. She forever lost feeling in one hand, and her husband the use of a leg. As they spoke to FoxNews. com, their young daughter, recently rescued from sex slavery, gently wrapped her frail mom in blankets to cover her legs. “After six months, they separated the disabled people and put us in a truck. We were dumped at the Kurdish border,” Murad said. “We are grateful for our lives but we have nothing, no medicines and no money. Before this, we had a beautiful quiet life. But they broke us inside. ” With barely enough means for survival, the notion of psychological help is a distant priority that will loom larger if the Mosul operation succeeds. At one displacement camp in Duhok, a    boy just rescued after being held and indoctrinated in a jihadist camp, attempted to behead his baby sister with a kitchen knife. He was stopped by his mother. Countless rescued girls have attempted suicide. One by one, members of the Yazidi community produced documentation to FoxNews. com of the war crimes inflicted upon them, from gruesome “before and after” photos of men beheaded by ISIS, to their grandchildren being burned alive on hotplates, to the young children who succumbed to the heat and starvation while fleeing their ancestral homelands. Many of the Yazidis refer to their loved ones, who were captured more than two years ago and have not been heard from since, as “still with ISIS. ” However, after Mosul is cleared, and answers still not found, many fear that even greater grief and suffering will ensue. Also of grave concern to the community leaders is that with the lack of assistance, many more Yazidis will continue to flee. “We need protection and help from the international community,” Chawish said. “People will only stay if they know this won’t happen again  …     Or else we, as Yazidi people, will vanish. ” The Yazedi Human Rights Organization reports that over 800, 000 Yazidi lived in their native Iraq, but that number has dropped to below 450, 000 today. Genocidal campaigns against the   minority have been a persistent hallmark of their history, although nothing on the scale of the   atrocities. The Yazidi religion predates Islam and Christianity, but integrates numerous aspects of Abrahamic faith. Their calendar starts almost a thousand years before the Hebrew one, making it one of the world’s oldest vestigial religions, and due to their worship of a Peacock Angel, hardline Islamic militants like ISIS have justified their killings by referring to them as “devil worshippers. ” In spite of the pending reckoning, last week hundreds of Yazidis  —   many traveling from the increasing Diaspora scattered around the world  —   traveled to their holiest site, the Temple of Lalish, on the outskirts of Mosul for their annual pilgrimage, held every October. The event served as something of a modest, but not melancholy, commemoration of their resilience in the face of evil. The crooked, ancient cobblestone streets of Lalish were ablaze with bright colors as families slept out on the roof tops under the still warm fall skies, market stalls were set up selling traditional goods, hundreds wandered barefoot to kiss the primordial trees, which they date back to Eden, and several took turns to enter their sacred White Spring to be baptized. For many  —   even adults  —   this marked the first time they had ever even been able to make the roughly   journey between Sinjar and Lalish, the first time they have been baptized in their holiest of waters. “Many people from Sinjar are very poor and they lived their lives very happy, but very poor,” said one young Yazidi, Baxtiar Baadri, exuding a quiet pride as a middle aged man stepped inside the sacred spring. “He became a big man not yet baptized  —   but today for him that changes. And if there is hope for one Yazidi, there is hope for us all. ”",1.0
"Archaeological Victims of ISIS Rise Again, as Replicas in Rome - The New York Times. ROME  —   A statue of a   winged bull from the Northwest Palace in Nimrud, Iraq, that was bulldozed by the Islamic State last year to great outcry has been faithfully recreated using modern technology and put on exhibit at the Colosseum in Rome to spur discussion of the possible reconstruction of   archaeological sites.   reconstructions were also made of two damaged Syrian sites: the archive room of Ebla and a portion of a ceiling from the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, as examples of how conflict can devastate a nation’s fragile heritage. “Nimrud was the first place to be destroyed,” said Frances Pinnock, the   of the Ebla expedition, the most important Italian archaeological expedition to Syria. “It was a palace known as the Versailles of the ancient Near East, and so it was chosen because it was symbolic. ” “We included Ebla because it represents abandonment, what happens to a site when a mission is no longer present to protect it,” said Ms. Pinnock, who is a member of the scientific committee for the exhibit. “And Palmyra is a wound” and a place of violent murders, not just of Khalid   the retired chief of antiquities for Palmyra, who was killed in August 2015, three months after the Islamic State took the city, “but of more than a dozen employees, killed in brutal ways only because they tried to protect the heritage,” Ms. Pinnock said. Though the violence in the Middle East continues, archaeologists and officials from various international organizations continue to explore various options for the reconstruction of archaeological sites in Syria and Iraq once the fighting has abated. “There’s a lot of discussion over how to reconstruct what is lost,” said Stefano De Caro, the director general of the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, based in Rome, who is also on the scientific committee. “This is one proposal combining technical documentation and manual skill. ” This is not the first attempt to resurrect ancient art from the ashes of war. Last month, a replica of an ancient arch from Palmyra, destroyed a year ago, was erected in City Hall Park in New York. That model was made using   scanning, but it is smaller than the original, and less finished, some officials here suggested. The Italian models are    reconstructions based on extensive documentation of various kinds. After being created using   printing techniques, the reproductions were then covered with a layer of plastic material mixed with stone powder and finished by hand to replicate the original as closely as possible. Ms. Pinnock noted that the restorer based in Florence who completed the Nimrud statue even included scratches on the surface, “to give the sense of passing time. ” Such minute detail was possible because the restorer worked from   photographs taken by United States military officers and later stored in Mosul, she said. “We have shown that scientifically it is possible to do good work. ” The Ebla reconstruction was accomplished by a company based in Rome that specializes in film sets and props, while the Bel temple ceiling was made by a company in Ferrara that already works in casting copies. “These aren’t just isolated objects,” but markers of a civilization’s “history, context and value,” brought alive “thanks to Italian know how,” said Francesco Rutelli, a former mayor of Rome and culture minister and the driving force behind the exhibit. “This is also an Italian story that you see here today. ” On display are also two marble busts from the museum in Palmyra that were damaged during the   occupation by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “We baptized them the   of Palmyra,” Mr. Rutelli said. The badly damaged sculptures were brought to Italy so that they could be restored, making an arduous journey from Damascus to Rome via Beirut, Lebanon. “The only artifacts to leave Syria have been part of the illicit trafficking trade, but these came out with an accord,” Mr. Rutelli said. Even though it is “very rare during a conflict that a corridor for culture opens,” he said, Damascus cultural officials had allowed the sculptures to travel because they knew the pieces would be in good hands, and on display in a prestigious spot where the plight of Syrian art would reach many. “The Colosseum is the most visited site in our country,” Francesco Prosperetti, the art official responsible for Rome’s main archaeological area, said in a statement. It was chosen to give maximum visibility to a “global message on the importance of cultural heritage and its value as part of national identity, on the need to protect it, preserve it, restore it and in some cases rebuild it,” he said.",-1.0
"Delingpole: Trump Edges Closer To Pulling Out Of Paris Climate Agreement. President Trump is edging closer to taking the U. S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement. [The clincher, according to insider reports, is that he has been warned by lawyers that if he doesn’t pull out it may seriously affect his plans to revive the U. S. economy with cheap, abundant fossil fuel and a reduction in environmentalist red tape.  Up until now Trump has been torn between two factions within the White House: the Steve   Pruitt faction who think he should honor his campaign promise to quit and the     Tillerson faction which would prefer the U. S. stay and keep a “seat at the table. ” But as Trump hinted at a Saturday rally  —   when he described the agreement as ‘ ’ and an example of the kind of deal where ‘the United States pays the costs and bears the burdens while other countries get the benefit and pay nothing’  —   he is now inclined towards exit. The agreement states that a country “may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition,” which sources say concerns White House Counsel Don McGahn and his staff. If Trump wanted to ratchet down former President Barack Obama’s promise of a 26 percent to 28 percent emissions cut by 2025, the agreement may prevent it. The administration is also worried that staying in the accord would give environmentalists a legal argument to prevent Trump from repealing climate regulations like the Clean Power Plan. If and when Trump does pull out the worldwide repercussions will be enormous. “Climate change” is so embedded in the consciousness of the political, corporate and financial elite that even this random guy from NATO is asking us, straightfaced, to believe that it represents some kind of major global security threat. General Denis Mercier  —   who glories in the title of “Nato’s supreme allied commander for transformation”  —   says: “If one nation, especially the biggest nation  …     if they do not recognise a problem, then we will have trouble dealing with the causes of climate change. ” And I don’t think he means China. Nor, you can be sure, will the withdrawal be greeted with much applause by the mainstream media. To give you an idea, here’s how CNN dealt with the possibility that Trump might pull out of Paris. “What happens if the U. S. pulls out?” Jake Tapper asks CNN’s   expert Rene Marsh. Marsh tells it as only a CNN environmental reporter can: “Essentially this agreement is, many would argue, to save the planet. They want to rid the planet of this carbon pollution in this century. ” And now evil President Trump wants to stop saving the planet and keep all that carbon pollution. Oh the humanity! Oh the polar bears  …    .",1.0
"End the Threat of Internet Access Taxes. The U. S. Senate will soon vote on whether to permanently ban   taxes. Congress enacted the ban in 1998, and there have been nearly a   renewals since then. Senator John Thune (R. S. D.) has done present and future taxpayers a great favor by leading the fight to include it in the upcoming customs bill. Members of Congress from both parties have voted again and again against the taxation of Internet access. In the U. S. public support for   Internet access is overwhelming. The world agrees. Last year tens of thousands of Hungarians filled the streets to forestall their government’s attempt at imposing   taxes. For more than 15 years, Congress held the threat of taxing Internet access over the heads of the American people, routinely passing   temporary bans on state and local access taxes, but refusing to permanently close the door on what amounts to taxing interstate commerce. Ironically, the most recent holdup was orchestrated by proponents of a new tax scheme on purchases made over the Internet. RELATED: Dick Durbin Wants to Tax Your Internet, Though support of the ban is bipartisan and widespread, some senators, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D. Nev.) are fighting hard to pull this provision out of the customs bill, either because they oppose the ban outright, or because they prefer to hold it hostage so they can pass other tax increases (like the new scheme for taxing Internet sales). Or both. These senators are mounting an effort to strip the ban out of the customs bill when it comes to the floor. This time, however, when these senators try to stop the    ban, they will be on record. Through their public vote to strip the permanent ban out of the bill, Americans will know where each senator stands, and it’s going to be tough for anyone in any red or purple state to explain away a vote for allowing   taxes. Share article on FacebookshareTweet New technologies that depend on Internet access are created every day. If our digital economy is to continue to thrive, it is imperative that Congress quit playing games with what has become an absolute necessity to business, education, entertainment, and basic communication. One of the greatest barriers to Internet access is cost. For example, a tax that increased the price of Internet access by just 1 percent would reduce demand for Internet access by 2. 75 percent, according to an estimate by former White House Chief Economist Austan Goolsbee. RELATED: Stop the Streaming Tax, This new burden would disproportionately fall on   Americans. Households of lesser means could pay ten times more of their income than they do now for access. Many families would see their access to the Internet limited, or they might even be shut out altogether. It is past time for Congress to rule out the threat of Internet taxation. Ever since I served on the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce back in 1999, I’ve been arguing that we need to make the ban permanent. Our innovation economy and the American people deserve complete certainty that Internet access won’t be taxed. Senators should vote against stripping the permanent   ban out of the customs bill. They must ignore protests from their colleagues who want to retain the uncertain status quo as leverage in some other fight. It’s time to free the hostage.,",1.0
" Outdoor Companies Are In A Fierce Battle With Republicans Over Obama’s National Monuments. ’A group of outdoor companies led by clothier Patagonia are waging a battle against Republican lawmakers who want to rescind one of President Obama’s last national monuments and end the federal government’s control of millions of acres of land.’ ’Patagonia’s campaign comes after Utah lawmakers in February passed a resolution urging President Trump to rescind the Bears Ears National Monument.’ ’Throughout all of these efforts Patagonia has been the most prominent company fighting to keep the Bears Ears National Monument  —   but it isn’t alone.’ ’For lawmakers who want the federal government out of the land management business, Bears Ears is just the tip of the iceberg.’ ’The conflict is also not limited to the West. ’] On Tuesday, Patagonia took the extraordinary step of transforming the front page of its website into a defense of Bears Ears National Monument, which Obama created in December. In a series of stunning 360º interactive videos posted on the site, the company directs viewers to “take action” by calling or tweeting at   Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who overseas national parks, monuments, and about 500 million acres of federal land. Since 2013, Patagonia has spent more than $1. 7 million advocating for and defending the Bears Ears National Monument, according to Patagonia communications director Corley Kenna. The monument covers 1. 3 million acres in Utah’s   San Juan County and the designation was controversial from the get go, with some Utah leaders arguing it would hamstring the local economy. Companies such as Patagonia were joined by conservationists and Native American tribes in lobbying the Obama administration in favor of the monument designation. Patagonia continues to devote resources to Bears Ears because the company believes the “area is vulnerable to the fossil fuel industry” and sees it as a “moral imperative” to protect the region, Kenna said. “I think the reason why we are so invested in this is because history has shown that when states get control of federal lands they’re sold off to the highest bidder,” she said, referring to Republican proposals that would have states take over vast public lands in the West. The resolution  —   as well as other efforts in Utah to limit federal control of public lands  —   sparked a backlash from much of the outdoor retail industry. First, Patagonia pulled out of a major retail convention that for decades had taken place in Salt Lake City. Then, the organizers of the convention itself announced that they would move to another state. The convention  —   which also featured big names like REI and The North Face  —   reportedly pumped $45 million into Salt Lake’s economy. Its departure marks perhaps the biggest escalation in the ideological conflict over public lands between Utah and the outdoor retail industry. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said the retailers’ decision to leave was “offensive” and “reflects a gross ingratitude,” according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Herbert’s spokesperson Paul Edwards praised Patagonia’s new videos as “a stunning piece of work” Wednesday in a conversation with BuzzFeed News. But he said that Herbert and Utah oppose the monument designation because they preferred a legislative approach rather than the use of the Antiquities Act, which gives the president unilateral authority to create monuments on existing federal land. Edwards also described the departure of the outdoor retail convention as a “ ” for both the state and the companies, and said he’d like Salt Lake City to get the chance to bid for it in the future. The North Face said in a statement to BuzzFeed News last month that it stepped up donations to the Conservation Alliance in response to “threats to the monument’s designation. ” Retailer REI has also waded into the fray. In a blog post last month, company president and CEO Jerry Stritzke wrote that when he heard about efforts to undo the national monument he “was mad as hell and disappointed. ” On Wednesday, KEEN Footwear said that it “does not support the rescinding of any monument designation. ” The company maintains a “Live Monumental” website in support of public lands, including Bears Ears and Gold Butte, a monument in Nevada also created by Obama in December. A spokesperson for Salt Lake City based KÜHL Clothing said Wednesday it is “certainly concerned” about efforts to undo the monument, which it supports, though it has “not taken an official position” on lawmakers’ actions. The controversy also knocked Utah out of contention for a bicycle trade show, and a number of other clothing and gear retailers have weighed in as well. In addition to Bears Ears, Utah lawmakers have also passed a resolution asking Trump to shrink the Grand   National Monument, which President Clinton created in 1996. Utah’s two resolutions, both of which have inflamed outdoor companies, underscore the fact that the debate over public lands is about a larger movement, not just one specific location. Case in point: Utah has been trying for years to get the federal government to turn over public lands  —   were are managed by the federal government and comprise the majority of the states such as Utah and Nevada. Lawmakers in Utah have helped export land transfer strategies to other states, and there are similar efforts underway in Nevada and other western states. In most cases, advocates are arguing that the federal government has been a poor steward of the land and that increasing regulations have decimated rural populations that rely on industries such as ranching and logging. “It feels like you have an absentee landlord,” Edwards said of federal land management. He specifically cited federal handling of invasive species, forest management, and wild horses as issues with ongoing problems. “Everyone agrees this is an extraordinary area that deserves significant protection,” he said. Zinke, the Interior secretary, has said he is opposed to selling off federal land, though neither the Interior Department nor the White House have responded to numerous BuzzFeed News questions specifically about Bears Ears. And either way, it’s unclear how a national monument could be legally rescinded. In February, Maine Gov. Paul LePage asked Trump to rescind the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument. Obama created that monument as well, though its made up of formerly private land that was donated to the government. BuzzFeed News reached out to LePage and a number of Utah lawmakers but did not receive a response. Nevertheless, Patagonia and other outdoor companies are unlikely to back down. Kenna pointed out Patagonia’s founder is from Maine, and that an array of companies that are normally rivals have come together to oppose the dismantling of national monuments. “These places are all equal in our minds and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that that national monument is also protected,” Kenna said, “We’re certainly not stopping here. ”   ",-1.0
"Pope Francis Condemns ‘Barbaric Attack’ on Egyptian Christians. In a telegram to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   Pope Francis denounced Friday’s Ramadan massacre of Egyptian Christians while promising continued prayers for the victims, their families, and the entire nation. [The strongly worded message, signed by the Vatican’s secretary of state on behalf of the Pope, called the slaughter a “senseless act of hatred” and a “violent outrage,” resulting in “tragic loss of life and injury. ”  While expressing his “heartfelt solidarity” with all those affected by the attack, Francis said he was particularly mindful of the children who lost their lives when masked gunmen opened fire on a busload of Christian pilgrims on their way to the Monastery of St. Stephen in the Minya province south of Cairo on Friday morning. Commending “the souls of the deceased to the mercy of the Almighty,” the Pope also assured their grieving families and all who have been injured of his “ardent prayers” while pledging his “continued intercession for peace and reconciliation throughout the nation. ” On Saturday morning, the Pope traveled to Genoa, Italy, for a pastoral visit and opened his meeting with bishops, priests, and the religious with a moment of silence and a Hail Mary for the Christians murdered in Minya: #PopeFrancis begins Genoa mtg with bps, priests, religious with moment of silence  Hail Mary for Christians murdered in Egypt pic. twitter.   —   Cindy Wooden (@Cindy_Wooden) May 27, 2017,  Pope Francis visited Cairo in late April, shortly after twin suicide bombings by Islamic State militants took the lives of at least 46 Egyptian Christians who were celebrating Mass in two churches in the Minya province on Palm Sunday, a week before Easter. The pontiff took the occasion to condemn the attacks, repeating his statement that killing in the name of God is blasphemy. “Let us say once more a firm and clear ‘No!’ to every form of violence, vengeance and hatred carried out in the name of religion or in the name of God,” the Pope told a peace conference meeting at the   university, Egypt’s highest Islamic authority. The Minya province has the highest Coptic Christian population in the country and has been the scene of a number of attacks on the Christian minority. Christians in Minya have lived in constant fear of attacks from the area’s large Salafi Muslim population. In certain local villages, the faithful celebrate Mass before a cross drawn on a wall, making it easy to erase quickly to avoid attacks. Follow Thomas D.

"Google Street View’s beefed-up privacy blurs cow’s face. We are used to faces and number plates being obscured by Google to protect privacy for images on Street View, but animals don’t often suffer the same fate  —   except for this Cambridge cow. The picture, which was taken last summer at Coe Fen, was spotted by the Guardian’s US opinion editor David Shariatmadari. Although the cow can be seen in all its bovine glory in one image near the river Cam, Google appears to have blurred it for a tighter crop. The search giant admitted its technology may have been a little overeager. A spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic   technology has been a little overzealous. Of course, we don’t begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame. ” Shariatmadari’s tweet has been retweeted more than 9, 000 times  —   with plenty of cow jokes among the replies.

"On ’London Road,’ Murder, Music And British Lower-Middle-Class Manners. London Road is not the first musical to be made about a   serial killer. But it may be the first to draw its poetic   from the testimony of residents of a rural English town where five prostitutes were found murdered in 2006. Aside from a wicked moment or two when a leering movie star known for playing unsavory fellows shows up to throw us off the scent, this is not about the murderer. It’s about the undoing  —   and remaking  —   of a community in its own words, owing more to Shirley Jackson than Masterpiece Theater. As it happens, the film was worked up from a National Theater workshop that grew into a hit stage play. This is not Shakespeare or Sheridan though, nor is it one of those   bits by West End playwrights with their gun sights fixed on the ruling class. London Road beams its sympathy, as well as an irreverent eye, on one    street in Ipswich, Suffolk, whose residents have long resented the sex workers plying their trade under the noses of the righteous and respectable. It helps to know going in that the cultural gulf between the British   and working class is wide and deep, in no small measure because only a smidgen of bad luck separates the one from the other. When the five women are found dead and the chief suspect  —   a transient truck driver dubbed the Ipswich Ripper  —   is arrested in a neglected house on the same street, London Road quickly becomes the focus of a media circus, followed by painful introspection within the community about its own claims to good character. All the residents are played by actors, one or two of whom you’ll be able to name. Every line they utter  —   the script is by Alecky Blythe, who specializes in ”verbatim theatre,” a la Anna Deavere Smith  —   is taken from recorded interviews. So there’s a documentary impulse at work here that’s integral to British realism. But London Road is an entirely different animal from any film by Mike Leigh or Ken Loach or Stephen Frears. Based on the play by director Rufus Norris (Broken) London Road fairly bristles with visible technique. This is because it’s a famously hellish prospect to adapt a stage play for the screen: You have to get the action out of the house, and you have to put a stop to all that declaiming. As with other filmed versions of National Theater productions that have brought the best of British theater to North America, a swooping, restless camera follows the players around their hitherto obscure town as they wring their hands about the identity of their resident serial killer. Paranoia blooms, and suspects appear in sinister   that make you wonder not simply who the perp might be, but who the women’s regular customers were. Once you get used to the film’s most potent strategy  —   the incantatory repetition of dialogue in song and    —   it takes on the cadence of hypnotic poetry, a Greek chorus that picks out a billowing unease that only begins to spread following a trial verdict that was meant to bring closure. Yes, London Road will spruce itself up with a riot of color in hanging baskets and bunting and block parties and doors thrown open to neighbors. Yes, there will be jubilant togetherness  —   for everyone but the now   prostitutes, who sound a desolate, lonely voice from the gasworks at the end of the street. At the climax, London Road administers a   kick to complacent liberalism when the heroic organizer of the community’s rebirth, a single parent named Julie played by Olivia Colman, delivers a frank opinion about the streetwalkers’ fate, while her teenaged daughter squirms on the couch beside her. As Shirley Jackson so well understood in her masterpiece, The Lottery, no community coheres without its sacrificial lamb.",-0.5
"Foreign Minister To Turks In Europe: Be ’Loyal’ To New Nation Or Go Home. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has made a clear message to those Turks living in Austria who want to involve themselves in Turkish politics, saying they are free to leave the country to do so. [The failed coup in Turkey, which led to thousands taking to the streets in Vienna over the weekend, has been sharply dismissed by Austria’s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who joins presidential candidate for the   migration Freedom Party (FPÖ) Norbert Hofer in denouncing the action.  Mr. Kurz has stated that those who protested in support of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan were “anything but commendable”. In a new interview on Thursday the minister has gone so far as to say that Turks in Austria who want to participate in Turkish politics should leave, and the ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador over the incident, Kurier reports. “Whoever wants to be involved in Turkish domestic politics, they are free to leave our country,” Mr. Kurz told Austrian media via a telephone call from an   State conference taking place in Washington DC on Thursday. The comments are a reaffirmation of  the stance of Mr. Kurz’s party, the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) who have said they expect all Austrians of Turkish origin to behave in a manner “loyal to Austria”. The coordination of the demonstrations is also under the microscope as some accuse Ankara and the Erdoğan regime of having a hand in organising events.  The issue led to the summoning of Turkish ambassador Hasan Gögüş who has dismissed what he called “biased and unfair criticism” of the purges currently ongoing in Turkey. “Such behaviour could also mean support for the rebels,” he said in a letter to Austrian media in which he slammed the coverage of the coup attempt. The purges have so far seen a travel ban on all Turkish academics and the suspension, firing, or imprisonment of more than 50, 000 government workers, educators and armed forces members. Mr. Gögüş, however claimed that the participants in the coup will be tried “by the independent judiciary in line with our international obligations and applicable law”. The statement is countered by the Turkish announcement Thursday that the European Convention on Human Rights would be suspended, despite rumours of torture of prisoners persisting. “We have evidence that the demonstrations for Erdoğan that have taken place in Vienna were called for directly from Turkey  …     and that, of course, is absolutely untenable and we want to protest against that,” Mr. Kurz told Austrian broadcaster ORF justifying the reason for the summoning of the ambassador. The Austrian Foreign Ministry says above all they want “clarity in which direction Turkey develops”.",1.0

"What’s The Difference Between Famine And Hunger? A Food FAQ. Can eating insects help people survive a famine? Are there new ways to help farmers water their crops when drought strikes? Isn’t the basic hunger problem that there’s just not enough food to go around? Those are some of the tough questions that you submitted in April for our monthly #CuriousGoat series. We’d asked what you wanted to know about world hunger. You sent in so many good queries that we didn’t want to pick just one to answer, as we typically do. So here are some of the best  —   and our best answers. The questions have been edited for length and clarity. What’s the difference between hunger and famine? And why should we care about famines?  —   Anjala Illemassene, ”Hunger is a physiological sensation,” explains Tufts professor Daniel Maxwell, acting director of the university’s Feinstein International Center, based at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. It’s brought on by what is formally called ”food insecurity,” which is just another way of saying a lack of nutritious food on a regular basis. ”Famine is an extreme event leading to widespread death,” he says, and it’s typically about politics and violence, as much as it is about the overall availability of food. Hunger exists everywhere, although it’s more common in areas with high levels of poverty. For a situation to be officially declared a famine by the United Nations, hunger needs to be concentrated and catastrophic. As we explained in February, there’s a   scale used to rate food insecurity emergencies. To hit No. 5, which is ”famine,” here are the criteria: ”At least 1 in 5 households now faces an extreme lack of food, more than 30 percent of the population is suffering from acute malnutrition, and at least two people out of every 10, 000 are dying each day.” In the 20th century, Maxwell notes, famines killed nearly 75 million people  —   although outright starvation was often not the direct cause. Instead, people in famines die from cholera, measles or other nasty diseases because severe malnutrition leads to compromised immune systems, he says. Even people who manage to survive a famine are gravely affected, adds Stephen Were Omamo, deputy director of the World Food Programme. Severe malnutrition  —   which according to UNICEF affects an estimated 16 million children under the age of 5 worldwide  —   has health implications for life, particularly among kids affected during their first 1, 000 days. When does food aid work well, and when doesn’t it work?  —   Anna, It works best when people actually get it, and that’s not always so easy to pull off, says Tufts’ Maxwell, who’s   of the book, Food Aid After Fifty Years: Recasting Its Role. Beans, lentils and other staples are great, he says, unless they’re sitting in a warehouse, waiting to get boxed, shipped, trucked and who knows what else. The clunky transportation process can take months to coordinate. Now, though, food is often purchased and stored closer to where it’s needed, Maxwell says. But this approach can still be problematic, he says, if its distribution interferes with local markets. That’s why the new form of food aid that’s really taken off is money. Cash can be transmitted digitally rather than airdropped or shipped. ”It allows us to move much more quickly with a tailored response,” WFP’s Omamo says. Plus, buying power gives people the chance to pick and choose what they need, while generating economic activity. Omamo says   transfers  —   a term that includes all cash transfers and vouchers, both physical and digital  —   accounted for less than 1 percent of the food assistance WFP delivered in 2009. Now it’s close to 20 percent (with a value of about $1 billion a year). Can you address population growth in relation to hunger and famine?   —   Nadia G. To do that, we need to discuss Thomas Robert Malthus, an English economist and scholar born in 1766. One idea Malthus laid out in his most influential paper, ”An Essay on the Principle of Population,” was that the world population continues to grow exponentially, and the food supply can’t possibly keep up. If that’s true, any day now, we should have too little food for too many people. It’s a concept called the Malthusian theory of population. Although the theory has continued to circulate, it’s been disproved, Omamo of WFP says. Agricultural innovation has helped produce much more food than Malthus ever expected, and population growth is actually showing signs of slowing. ”The answer is not, ’More people bad,’ ” Omamo adds. ”There isn’t a direct link.” Consider the current state of the world: There are plenty of calories to sustain all 7. 5 billion of us, but they’r not distributed evenly. Hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry each night. That’s not to say Omamo isn’t worried about the future, and particularly the effects of climate change. If we don’t change how we use energy, Omamo says, hunger will become an even bigger challenge. There are some regions that cannot support the population that lives there. What’s the point in providing food aid to an unsustainable population?  —   Anonymous, We’re going to assume you meant drylands, or places without much water. There’s a major problem with writing them off, says Bilal Butt, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment in Ann Arbor. ”They’re almost half of the world’s surface area,” he says. They’re home to hundreds of millions of people, and have supported livestock and people for thousands of years. What’s more, Butt adds, drylands have generally been quite sustainable, especially for nomadic herders. That they move from place to place ”has been looked at as outdated and irrational,” Butt says. ”But it could not be further from the truth.” They must stay mobile to find forage and water because resources are distributed unevenly in drylands. Because of this strategy, they’re not continually degrading one patch of land by grazing on it. Over the years, nomadic groups have developed various strategies for survival in tough conditions, Butt says. One example he offers is from Kenya, where groups often keep a diverse group of livestock, each with separate feeding strategies. Cows eat differently than sheep, goats and camels, Butt says, so to have a mix is an adaptation to drylands. In most circumstances, at least some of your animals will find enough grub to survive. (Here is a fascinating story from Beef Magazine extolling the virtues of multispecies grazing.) This technique relies on widespread mobility, and being able to seek out new places to live. So as more land has been developed and taken away from grazing, and conservation areas have banned livestock, that’s limited options. That’s why, Butt says, it’s common to see livestock nibbling on grass in downtown Nairobi. The animals have been there much longer than the cars and buildings. The name of that city comes from the Maasai ”cold water,” he explains, because it’s historically been a place that the Maasai would water their livestock. The big problems arrive when a drought strikes, Butt says, and that’s when you’re likely to see images of crowded displaced persons or refugee camps, where people flee not only to escape conflict but also to find food and water during a drought. What you can’t tell from looking at their faces, Butt notes, is that they’ve often traveled from hundreds of miles away. ”It’s all too easy to dehumanize people in this process,” he adds. ”But they’re not careless, and unsustainably using the land.” Instead, they’re dealing with droughts that in recent years have increased in frequency and intensity. ”Then you ask yourself why,” Butt says. ”Some would speculate that this [increase in droughts] is a climate change signature. The people contributing the least to climate change are being affected the most.” What are some of the boldest, most sustainable ways help farmers water their crops in   areas?  —   Karen Teber  Pose this question to Robert Opp, director of the World Food Programme’s innovation division, and he’ll start talking enthusiastically about Styrofoam with holes poked into it and plastic trays. It may not sound like much. But use the holes to prop up plants, and let the roots soak in a   mix in those trays, and you’ve got a hydroponic garden. Opp believes the soilless technique has the potential to change how people cultivate crops, particularly in the developing world. ”You can grow food with 90 percent less water and 75 percent less space,” he says. WFP has sent starter hydroponic kits that cost $25 to urban households in Peru, where they face a number of the same constraints as people living in conflict zones. (Namely, no space.) And it’s been helping them grow leafy greens in about 4 to 6 weeks that they can serve to their families and sell to make money. Hydroponics are also being tested with a refugee population in Algeria that was displaced 40 years ago because of conflict in the Western Sahara. ”They didn’t want vegetables for themselves,” Opp explains, since that’s not typically a part of their diet. But they’ve grown barley shoots to feed their goats, which then produce milk for the people to consume. The latest twist is combining hydroponics with food computers, which are units about half the size of a dishwasher and that boast a completely controlled environment, including LED lighting and automated nutrient release. Basically, they allow researchers to create any climate imaginable. WFP has teamed up with MIT and other partners to test a bunch of these computers in Jordan and determine how playing with variables can translate into the highest yield possible for crops. Can eating insects help people during a famine?  —   Anonymous, On a small scale, the answer is yes, according to Patrick Durst, senior forestry officer for Asia and the Pacific at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In various times of famine, he says, people have hunted insects for sustenance. ”They are tough and can survive in harsh conditions. When crops die, there are still insects around that people are eating,” he says. They can be nutritious sources of protein and fat. And they can be delicious  —   hence, why edible insects are a ”preferred food” for many people around the world. So how about shipping giant bags of bugs to starving people in famines? Durst sees several potential hurdles to this idea. For starters, you’d need to produce a lot more bugs, and the recipients would have to want to eat them. Maybe that’d be more likely in the form of   flour, he says, which could be an extra nutritious alternative to the normal stuff. ”There’s no reason that can’t be part of the arsenal, but we have a long way to go,” says Durst, who explains that more research is needed into shelf life and allergic reactions. (Apparently, people who have shellfish allergies often have the same problems with insects.) Anyway, Durst is not saying we can’t use insects to fight famine worldwide. It’s just not likely anytime soon. Thank you to everyone who participated in this #CuriousGoat. Vicky Hallett is a freelance writer in Florence, Italy.

"How to Deal With Digital Distractions - The New York Times. I used to teach at the graduate school of information sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. I couldn’t believe how many students looked at ESPN. com or its ilk in class. We live in a world of screens, where digital distractions contend with our need to learn. Is multitasking a good idea? No. Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor who pioneered research into how humans interact with technology, conducted numerous studies of people juggling different cognitive tasks, like talking on the phone, watching television and working on a computer. Basically, people are bad at it. They are actually moving in and out of different things quickly, not working simultaneously, and nothing gets enough attention. On the other hand, performance isn’t the same as learning.   Song, a psychologist working with the neuroscientist Patrick Bédard at Brown University, found that when people learn motor skills with a distraction, the two are internalized. That can create better learning, particularly if you have to recall facts in a dissonant environment. “When pilots are learning how to handle emergency situations,” Dr. Song said, “it’s better if they learn them with distractions going on. ” But don’t turn the volume to 11. “If you can take an exam while you have Twitter on, sure, study while you’re on Twitter,” Dr. Song said. “But you better negotiate with your teacher. By the way, colleagues say I shouldn’t even talk about this. ” If you’re easily distracted, do something small about it. Quiet music may be the distraction a flighty person needs to keep focusing. If the student tries to focus too completely, he may, paradoxically, break off altogether with a bigger distraction. Analog learning works better. Writing notes by hand is better than typing them on a laptop, according to a 2014 Princeton study. People taking notes by hand use fewer words but they have better recall of concepts. “People who take notes on computers are transcribing, and people taking notes by hand tend to be choosing more,” said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. “An important part of learning is ordering things, and you do that more with note taking. ” Web surfing is the new secondhand smoke. Dr. Zimmerman, like me, used to spot students looking at entertainment websites in class, a disengagement he thought hurt the student and the class over all. Even sitting next to someone multitasking on a laptop could affect your learning and performance, according to a 2012 Canadian study. With that discovery, he said: “I banned them. No one has complained. ”",-1.0
"Intel report: Putin directly ordered effort to influence election. Washington (CNN) The US intelligence community concluded in a declassified report released Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an ”influence campaign” aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The campaign    which consisted of hacking Democratic groups and individuals, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and releasing that information via   websites, including WikiLeaks    amounted to what the intelligence report called ”a significant escalation” in longtime Russian efforts to undermine ”the   liberal democratic order.” The report was the first official, full and public accounting by the US intelligence community of its assessment of Russian cyberhacking activities during the 2016 campaign and the motivations behind that hacking. ”We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for   Trump,” the report said.  ”Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the   liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations,” the report continued. The report said Moscow used a variety of tactics in a bid to sway the outcome.   ”Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations    such as cyberactivity    with overt efforts by Russian government agencies,   media,   intermediaries and paid social media users or ’trolls,’ ” the report found. The US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions. It noted that in the final   to the election, when polls favored Clinton to win the election, Moscow shifted its campaign to influence the election to one aimed at undermining the validity of the electoral results. ”Before the election, Russian diplomats had already publicly denounced the US electoral process and were prepared to publicly call into question the validity of the results,” the reported stated, adding that   government bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign on Election Night using the hashtag ”#DemocracyRIP.” US intelligence officials also assessed ”with high confidence” that the GRU Russian intelligence agency ”used the Guccifer 2. 0 persona, DCLeaks. com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyberoperations publicly.” The intelligence community also assessed ”with high confidence” that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material they obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. US intelligence agencies also noted in the report that the Russian influence campaign was not limited to the cyberhacking and release of private documents that drew headlines during the presidential campaign. The report stated that the campaign blended cyberhacking intelligence operations with overt propaganda efforts carried out by   media outlets and paid social media users. The propaganda efforts included Russian   media outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik casting Trump as ”the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets” as well as Russian propaganda officials casting Trump during the campaign as a victim of the US political establishment.  Meanwhile, the intelligence community noted that ”RT’s coverage of Secretary Clinton . .. was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism.” Clinton’s campaign first argued Russia was aiming to help Trump back in July, to which Trump’s campaign called the comment ”a joke.” After the election, Clinton argued to donors that Putin got involved in the 2016 election partially due to a grudge against her, a view that’s backed up in Friday’s report. ”Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” the report said. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. But Jesse Lehrich, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, expressed vindication Friday afternoon, tweeting:  ”every day: REPORTER: what about *this* @wikileaks email? ME: part of an unprecedented foreign cyberattack! !! REPORTER: so. .. no comment?” And Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, asked on Twitter, ”What is stopping PEOTUS from accepting intel community’s findings?  Until he accepts them, he is effectively siding   Putin over U. S.” Trump briefed, The report, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama, comes as Trump has continued to resist the US intelligence community’s conclusions that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that it aimed to help his campaign. Trump was briefed earlier Friday on the report by top US intelligence and law enforcement officials, and while he said he had ”a constructive meeting,” he declined to publicly agree with their conclusions. Instead, Trump stressed that ”there was absolutely no effect on the outcome whatsoever,” which the US intelligence community asserted in its report it was not in a position to assess. Trump did acknowledge in his statement the possibility that Russia could have been behind the hack, though he named China as well as a persistent cyberhacker. The US intelligence community also warned in its report Friday that Moscow would likely continue to pursue cyberhacking campaigns to influence future elections. ”Moscow will apply lessons learned from its   campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” it assessed. The 17 US intelligence agencies first concluded in October that Russian intelligence, directed by the most senior Russian officials, orchestrated the hacking of Democratic Party organizations. But since then, the US intelligence community said it had gathered additional information to make assessments of the motivations behind the cyberhacking operations: that the effort was aimed at undermining the US democratic process, hurting Clinton and helping Trump in the 2016 presidential election.",-1.0
"Medium launches ""Series,"" its take on Snapchat Stories. Medium on Wednesday launched a new mobile story platform, Series, that lets users post photos and short-form text pieces that ""unfold"" over time. The best way to describe Series is basically to say it is Medium's version of Snapchat Stories. There are two key differences from Snapchat Stories, though. Content doesn't expire after 24 hours and users can create as many different ""series"" as they want. The new feature comes as Medium struggles to develop a clear business model. In January, CEO Ev Williams admitted that the company ""didn't yet have the right solution to the big question of driving payment for quality content."" Series offers it a way to grow on mobile and provides an alternative to the lengthy, text-based pieces for which it is known. But it isn't clear how it will solve the business question.",0.0
"Working Class Hero by John Lennon – protest playlist No 5. I feel like that song is a commentary song on not letting the forces that be hold you down or be complacent and not letting the machine hold you down.  For Lennon it was about him being working class and trying to move up into the middle class  —   but it resonates in the US at the moment because the middle class is disappearing.  Trump is assembling one of the richest cabinets in history, and telling   people he can save them, when he and his cabinet are not in tune with the majority of the country.  There’s complacency now and it takes effort to kick against it, and inform yourself about what your government is doing in your name. I think that’s something Lennon is trying to fight against, he’s saying go read a newspaper, go find out for yourself, don’t just trust what the ruling classes are telling you. When I was 18 years old I was getting into a heavy Beatles phase and this stood out. A lot of their work and even the solo stuff is beautifully arranged chords and melody, but Working Class hero is just pure lyrics, with some droney guitar and not much else, so you have to pay attention to his stark words. Years later it still speaks to me.",-0.5
"Between Police And Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton Walking A Fine Line . As Hillary Clinton began a meeting with police chiefs from departments around the country, she expressed gratitude to those on the force. ”They represent officers who get up every day, put on their uniforms, kiss their families goodbye and risk their lives on behalf of our communities,” the Democratic nominee said at the Thursday gathering in New York City. During the brief part of the meeting that was open to reporters, Clinton referenced Dallas, where five police officers were shot and killed in July. She also talked about Baton Rouge, La. where police fatally shot Alton Sterling, a    black man, while he was on the ground. Clinton said there’s a lot of work to do to repair trust between communities and police. ”We need to work together to bridge our divides, not stoke even more divisiveness,” she said. Clinton struck a similar theme earlier this week in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. While campaigning before a largely white audience in Scranton on Monday, Clinton mentioned the protests in Milwaukee, which broke out after police shot and killed a black man there last weekend. ”Look at what’s happening in Milwaukee right now,” Clinton said. ”We’ve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities and get back to the fundamental principle: Everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law.” Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald Trump, also talked about Milwaukee this week. During a campaign stop in the nearby suburb of West Bend, Trump accused Clinton of being   because of her calls for reform of the criminal justice system. ”She is against the police, believe me. You know it and I know it, and guess what: She knows it,” Trump told the crowd. Critics on the left, including groups like Black Lives Matter, have accused Clinton of being too slow to address concerns from   and their allies  —   a key part of the Democratic base  —   about aggressive policing. Clinton herself has acknowledged that tension. ”I know that just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people,” she said. Speaking to the African Methodist Episcopal Church General Conference on the day after the Dallas police shootings, Clinton called for national guidelines on the use of deadly force and better training for police. ”I’m talking about criminal justice reform the day after a horrific attack on police officers,” Clinton said. ”I’m talking about courageous honorable police officers just a few days after   killings in Louisiana and Minnesota.” While Hillary Clinton tries to navigate those conversations, Donald Trump is walking another line. This week, he’s been praising police while promising to bring ”law and order” to   neighborhoods. So far, though, he’s been making that case in front of mostly white audiences.",-0.5
"South Carolina jury to deliberate church shooter’s fate next week.  Jurors could begin deliberating on Tuesday whether white supremacist Dylann Roof should be sentenced to death or life in prison for killing nine black people at a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, a federal judge said on Friday. The same jury that found Roof, 22, guilty last month of 33 federal charges including hate crimes heard a third day of raw testimony from the survivors of victims in the June 2015 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. ”My heart is broken,” said Malcolm Graham, brother of librarian Cynthia Hurd, who was among those killed after welcoming Roof to the evening Bible study meeting where he opened fire. ”Cynthia was easygoing, my motivator, my example.” Family and friends attending the penalty phase of Roof’s trial sobbed at the memories of victims including Ethel Lance, a matriarch whose family was left in ”tattered pieces” by her death, daughter Sharon Risher said. Susie Jackson, 87, the oldest victim, ”had an unconditional love for everyone” despite living through decades of racial discrimination, grandson Walter ”Bernie” Jackson Jr. testified. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Joseph Hamski provided more insight into Roof’s motivation to kill, outlining references he made to racist and white supremacist groups in writings jail officers found in his cell in August 2015. Roof’s comments appeared to be a continuation of the racist manifesto police found in his car when he was arrested the day after the shooting. ”I was unable to finish before because I was in a hurry to get to Charleston,” Roof wrote from his cell, before stating his belief that Jews, Hispanics and Muslims posed a threat to white people. ”I did what I thought would make the biggest wave,” Roof wrote, noting he had no remorse. ”And now the fate of our race sits in the hands of my brothers who continue to live freely.” A few months before the shooting, Roof also posted his views on the white supremacist website Stormfront, Hamski said. ”I consider myself   in racism,” Roof wrote on the site, according to evidence displayed on a courtroom screen. Some people he corresponded with there said they wanted to meet him, but the agent did not say if any meetings took place. Roof is representing himself during the sentencing phase and does not plan to present any evidence in his defense. Testimony is expected to conclude on Monday.  (Writing by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Tom Brown) The jurors whose acquittal of a Minnesota police officer in the fatal shooting of a black motorist sparked public protests received a message of support from the judge who presided over the case, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported on Tuesday. New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public.

"Donald Trump would be world’s only national leader to reject climate science. Donald Trump would be the only national leader in the world to dismiss the science of climate change should he become president, putting him out of step even with Syrian president Bashar   Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe and Kim   the leader of North Korea. The potential isolation of the US on climate change has been laid bare by a new Sierra Club report which found universal acceptance of climate science among the leaders of the 195 countries recognized by the US state department. Close US allies such as Britain, Israel, Canada and France all have heads of government who have voiced their understanding that the world is warming primarily due to human activities.  Even totalitarian or undemocratic leaders accept mainstream climate science, with Assad calling for nations to “respond more effectively” to the issue and Kim supporting a   initiative to mitigate greenhouse gases. The Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, has labelled climate change a “major global challenge”. By contrast, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called global warming “bullshit” and a “hoax” that was “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive”. Trump has vowed to remove the US from the Paris climate accord, which was agreed by 195 countries last year in an attempt to curb   carbon dioxide emissions. He has also threatened to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency, which has come under sustained fire from Republicans over its role in Barack Obama’s   Clean Power Plan.  The Sierra Club report states that it is “essential that voters know that Donald Trump’s position on climate change is just another of his reckless, dangerous positions based more in reality TV than actual reality”. The environmental group said Trump’s stance would leave the US isolated on the world stage and undermine key alliances.  Trump’s pronouncements on climate change are also contrary to a large proportion of US voters, with recent Gallup polling showing a record number of Americans now see climate change as a threat to their way of life.  Separate research released on Tuesday by Yale University found that 45% of Americans are either “alarmed” or “concerned” about climate change, with levels of worry reaching levels not seen since 2008. Trump appears to be speaking for a small but notable minority, with Yale finding that 10% of Americans are “dismissive” of climate change as an issue. Hillary Clinton is likely to assail Trump’s position on climate change during the presidential campaign, with the expected Democratic nominee handed a new party platform that calls for a carbon price and hefty support for solar and wind energy. In his endorsement of Clinton on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders said the former secretary of state understood the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Sanders said that Trump, on the other hand, “chooses to reject science  —   something no presidential candidate should do.  “He believes that climate change is a hoax. In fact, he wants to expand the use of fossil fuel. That would be a disaster for our country and our planet. ”",-0.5
" How Mitt Romney Decided To Take On Donald Trump.  On Feb. 2, 2012, Mitt Romney stood uncomfortably on a stage at Donald Trump’s eponymous Las Vegas hotel and accepted the billionaire’s endorsement for president. “There are some things you just can’t imagine happening,” Romney said, looking as though he couldn’t believe what was happening. “This is one of them. ” Four years later, Trump is on the verge of winning the Republican presidential nomination  —   and Romney has emerged as one of the frontrunner’s most outspoken opponents. “Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,” Romney said in a speech Thursday. “His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing the American public for suckers. ” Romney’s decision to fully throw his support behind the   wing of the GOP was both personal and practical, according to friends and former advisers. In a fractured party with few neutral arbiters or power brokers, Romney came to believe he could play a key role in orchestrating the Republican opposition to Trump. And even though his allies continue to defend his cozying up to Trump in 2012, Romney himself has privately expressed a sense of personal obligation to help undo whatever damage that episode might have caused. “Mitt Romney has positioned himself as an elder statesman in our party,” said Katie Packer, a former adviser who now heads the leading   group, Our Priorities PAC. She added, “I think he views this as a time for him to not admonish the candidates, but to remind voters that the decision they face is a serious one and that these times require a serious candidate, not a con man who happens to be a reality TV star. ” Until recently, Romney had remained publicly neutral in the 2016 primaries, aside from criticizing a couple of Trump’s campaign provocations on Twitter. Last month, as Trump began racking up delegates, Romney decided to take him on more pointedly, calling on the billionaire to release his tax returns and speculating that they might contain secrets that would expose him as a fraud. The irony of this line of attack did not escape Mitt, according to people close to him. In 2012, Harry Reid publicly speculated that Romney had not paid taxes for 10 years  —   a baseless accusation that drove media chatter for weeks. Romney took a certain amount of delight in using the same tack against Trump. He experimented with a variety of verbiage while deciding how best to level the charge, before finally settling on the word “bombshell. ” He tapped it into his iPad and then chuckled to himself, awaiting Trump’s response. “That ‘bombshell’ remark was all him,” said Spencer Zwick, a longtime friend and head of his 2012 fundraising effort. “At his core, he really does believe that Trump needs to release his tax returns because he might be trying to hide something. But he also knows that if you’re going to get into a Twitter war with Donald Trump, you have to be ready to fight. ” For Romney, the   effort became more serious over the weekend, after he watched the candidate repeatedly refuse to disavow the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan during a CNN interview. Romney, who has long idolized his father for championing civil rights as a Republican governor in the ‘60s, was viscerally revolted by Trump’s performance. A disqualifying  disgusting response by @realDonaldTrump to the KKK. His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America. Two former Romney advisers said Trump’s CNN interview convinced him to speak out more forcefully against the frontrunner. They added, however, that he is under no illusion that his remarks will dissuade Trump’s supporters from voting for him. In fact, when friends and allies have urged him in recent months to weigh in more often on various 2016 developments, he has responded,   that he is “old news,” and a “loser”  —   a politician who lacks Marco Rubio’s skills as a communicator and Ted Cruz’s passionate base of supporters. “No one wants to hear from me,” he told one friend. But he also acknowledges that, as the former Republican nominee, he has the ability to drive media coverage with his commentary, and sources said he will be much more visible on TV in the coming days and weeks as he makes the case against Trump. “I don’t think Mitt’s speech is going to make or break Donald Trump’s candidacy. But I do think there are a lot of people in the party and a lot of people around the country who see him as being a man of integrity,” said Robert O’Brien, a friend and former foreign policy adviser to Romney. “Mitt would probably tell you his speech will not necessarily move the needle one way or the other. But there has been a lot of attention to his views, and he thinks it’s right that he weigh in at this time. ” His reemergence has, predictably, set off a fresh wave of speculation about his own political intentions, and two former Romney advisers said they’ve heard from scores of donors and loyalists this week asking if he is positioning himself to be drafted from the convention floor. But Romney has been adamant in public that he has no interest in such an outcome, and is expected to keep pushing back against the speculation, believing that his   message will be undermined if it’s viewed as advancing his own  . For the same reasons, Romney has opted not to endorse Marco Rubio, the candidate for whom he has privately expressed a preference. “Once you back a candidate, you’re just one of their surrogates,” said Zwick. “Mitt Romney is the former nominee of his party and he has his own opinions. He doesn’t have to get up and read the talking points from another campaign. ” If Republicans do arrive in Cleveland to a contested convention, one former adviser said Romney’s more likely role would be to help broker a “unity ticket” among the remaining   candidates. “He is one of the few people with the stature in the party to convene a meeting of the candidates at the right time and help midwife a Republican ticket that would help beat Hillary Clinton,” the adviser said.

"Sessions says he plans to testify before Senate intelligence panel.  (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday that he plans to testify before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday, but it was not immediately clear if he would testify in public or private. The move is a prominent switch from his previous plans to testify publicly on the Justice Department’s budget and puts him more directly in the firing line over questions about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States and a federal investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. Sessions had been scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House and Senate subcommittees that oversee his department’s budget, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will go before them instead, he said Saturday in letters to the chairmen of those subcommittees. ”Some members have publicly stated their intention to focus their questions on issues related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, from which I have recused, and for which the deputy attorney general appointed a special counsel, ” Sessions wrote.   ”The Senate intelligence committee is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information,” he added. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the federal Russia probe three months ago after The Washington Post reported on a pair of undisclosed meetings Sessions had during the campaign with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.  In a statement Thursday, however, the Justice Department said Sessions recused himself in light of his participation in President Donald Trump’s campaign, and ”it was for that reason, and that reason alone.” CNN later reported that congressional investigators have been probing whether Sessions had a possible third, undisclosed meeting with Kislyak. Former FBI Director James Comey hinted in his public hearing Thursday that Sessions, a former US senator from Alabama, may have had additional contacts with Russians, and said in a closed hearing that investigators had received Russian intercepts detailing a possible third meeting between Sessions and Kislyak, sources familiar with the briefing told CNN on Thursday. But federal investigators have not confirmed the meeting happened, and the Justice Department has denied it occurred. ”The Department of Justice appointed special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter,” said department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores, referring to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee the department’s Russia probe. ”We will allow him to do his job. It is unfortunate that anonymous sources whose credibility will never face public scrutiny are continuously trying to hinder that process by peddling false stories to the mainstream media. The facts haven’t changed The   did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.” Sessions said Saturday that he was accepting an invitation from the Senate intelligence committee, although that was not immediately confirmed. He would likely face questions from senators not only about meetings with Kislyak and subsequent recusal from the federal Russia probe, but also about his involvement with the President’s firing of Comey last month considering Sessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation, which Comey had been leading.",-1.0
"The rise of ’modest’ fashion.  (CNN) Modest dressing is a global cultural movement on the rise. A search of the word modest on Instagram opens a treasure trove of evidence. Sensitive layering, long silhouettes, raised necklines    so far, over half a million people have hashtagged the term modest fashion below their photos, and multiple   (modest dressing, modesty movement, modest style) are widely in use. At a glance, modest dressing appears to refer to a trend seen predominantly among young Muslims, though on closer inspection the movement includes women of many different faiths, and sometimes has nothing to do with religion at all. Trend analysts have dubbed what they interpret as a new wave of feminism the ” ” factor, says Iza Dezon, a trend forecaster at Peclers Paris. ”An empowered woman is no longer subject to a specific definition, nor must she live by a specific set of values,” she explains. ”We’re seeing the opening up of what empowerment means, allowing women to create their own definitions.”  The modest movement has been gaining steam for a few years now and the hijab has become a recognized symbol. In 2014 DKNY launched a bespoke modest fashion collection. In 2016, Dolce  Gabbana released a line of luxury hijabs and abayas. In the same year, HM featured a Muslim model wearing a hijab in a video to promote their sustainable fashion line. Last November, Halima Aden was the first beauty pageant contestant in history to wear a hijab at the Miss Minnesota USA competition.  Last month, Aden was invited to Milan to walk the Max Mara and Alberta Feretti catwalk in her hijab, having also been cast by Kanye West for his Yeezy show in New York a few weeks earlier. This week, Nike announced the launch of their first ”pro hijab.”  From the styling of Emma Watson in a recent Vanity Fair issue to reports that President Donald Trump might have suggested that ”women should dress like women,” female sartorial choices continue to ignite debate, and calls for the freedom to wear whatever a woman wants without judgment are becoming louder. The fashion industry is attuning to this. ”Many brands showed collections this season that were clearly designed with a degree of inclusivity in mind,” says Elizabeth Paton, European style correspondent for The New York Times. ”Balmain, for example, known for its   creations, with a huge following in the Middle East, this season had lots of high necks and low hemlines.” This comes as no surprise to Paton. ”All luxury brands are being forced to think more strategically about how to appeal to observant women, with numerous religious backgrounds. They can’t ignore the growing chorus of voices globally demanding more choice.”  This month, supermodel Gigi Hadid features on the cover of the newly launched Vogue Arabia in a diamond encrusted hijab. Hadid posted the cover image on her Instagram, with a caption praising the magazine. Read: How to dress for a revolution, ”Being   it means the world to me to be on the first ever cover( s) of @voguearabia,” wrote Hadid. ” I hope that this magazine will show another layer of the fashion industry’s desire to continue to accept, celebrate and incorporate all people  customs and make everyone feel like they have fashion moments they can relate to. .. and learn and grow in doing so.” The current climate couldn’t be better for Ghizlan Guenez’s new venture. Launching today, on international women’s day, The Modist models itself on the slogan ”luxury modest style for extraordinary women.” Guenez wants to fill what she sees as a hole in the luxury market. The Modist site will gear itself towards an international,   group of women of all ages, who want to express themselves through fashion while leaving something to the imagination. Guenez, who spent 14 years working in private equity before changing tack was inspired to address the needs of the women she saw around her. ”Our woman might be a banker who wants a power suit or the piece that will take her from morning to evening, that’s elegant and not too exposing.  ”She might also be a mother attending her daughter’s wedding, or a university student in Dubai who’s trendy, but dressed modestly for cultural reasons.” It was after witnessing the frustration of women around her first hand that Guenez first conceived The Modist.  ”The women I grew up with are modern and fashionable, but happen to dress this way. My mother, my cousins. .. they’d have to go from one store to another looking for pieces that could work for them. I realised there had to be a solution.”  Like most fashion   sites today the business has an editorial component    The Mod. ”On the editorial side, we will create fashion that not only inspires, but also empowers our woman,” says creative director and former Harper’s Bazaar Arabia Fashion Director Sally Matthews, ”providing an intimate glimpse into the lives, wardrobes and worlds of other women who are making a difference across the globe.”  The Modist launches with 75 contemporary luxury    and accessories designers including Peter Pilotto, Marni, and Phillip Lim.  ”There are so many brands I have enjoyed  ” says Sasha Sarokin, former buying manager at    who will head up the buying department. ”Take Marni for example. They’re so good at shape and proportion, and playing out print and color. I wear Marni, so does my mother,  so it was a natural aha! moment, and they totally got it.”  London print expert Mary Katrantzou’s collection will be available on The Modist too. ”My collections have never been about being physically revealing, but rather, revealing the aesthetic and personality of our women,” reflects Katrantzou. Read: Transgender model makes history at India’s Lakmé Fashion Week, ”I want every woman to feel confident and uplifted in my clothes.” She is looking forward to further engaging with her already strong international client base.  ”Women from key markets such as the Middle East are attracted to our use of bold color, embellishment and standout   pieces. .. I always look for imagery that can transcend boundaries for women, regardless of geographic location.” The market potential within the modest fashion sector is vast, and projected to reach a value of $484 billion by 2019, according to The Modist’s own research. Chief operating officer Lisa Bridgett was immediately drawn to being part of what she calls a ”global sisterhood,” of strong, experienced, intelligent women from diverse backgrounds working in London and Dubai working on The Modist. ”It was the most easily explicable concept, and it resonated almost instantaneously with me.”  Guenez has seized the moment with her message of inclusiveness. ”At a moment when much is being made of our differences, it’s an amazing moment to launch. Talking about how much we all have in common as women is our raison d’être.” Guenez was particularly inspired by the diverse participation in January’s Women’s Marches worldwide. ”We’ve seen a lot of good come out of social media recently. If it hadn’t been for social media, how would we have been called to action? How would we have known to go to the Women’s March at all?” Read: Kiko Mizuhara on karaoke, gay clubs and her passion for travel, Social media will be a priority for Guenez who sees Instagram and Facebook’s democratized international dialogue as the foundations of the modest dressing movement.  ”The girl in Jakarta is connecting with the girl in New York every day, as part of a bubbling global fashion dialogue,” says Guenez.  ”A big percentage of the women we’ll be speaking to are in Asia and the Middle East, where they’re involved in what we call ’social media on steroids’    everything happens there. We want to participate in this dialogue, and we want to further it.”",-1.0
"Media Falsely Reports Suspected Gang Shooting as ’Mass Shooting’ - Breitbart. In the early morning hours of July 5, BNO News reported a suspected   double murder in Phoenix as a “mass shooting. ”[The incident occurred around 10:30 p. m. MT Monday night and BNO labeled it a “mass shooting” while emergency personnel were still in the process of responding to it.  The “Breaking News Alert” issued by BNO said: Emergency services are responding to a mass shooting at a mobile home park in the community of Laveen in Phoenix, according to Maricopa County officials. It is unknown if the shooter is in custody. The third paragraph in the alert said: According to initial reports from the fire department, at least two people were killed and four others were injured. Among those injured is a baby who suffered a gunshot wound in the arm. There was no information about the conditions of those injured. But after the investigation into the incident, 12 News reported that two people were killed in “a shooting”  —   rather than a “mass shooting”  —   and four others were injured. And the father of two teens injured in the incident said “he believes this was a   shooting. ” In fact, he said “his kids had been talking on the internet with some alleged gang members who were all threatening to shoot each other. ” Breitbart News previously reported that the FBI criteria for a “mass shooting” is four fatalities in one incident. And because the criteria is fixed, Mother Jones editor Mark Follman warned against the growing tendency to exaggerate the number of “mass shootings” that occur. For example, Follman countered claims of “355 mass shootings” in 2015 by testing each incident by official criteria and showing the actual number of such shootings was “four. ” Writing in The New York Times on December 3, 2015, Follman said: At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have complied an     database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four “mass shootings” this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.

"Trump groping tape turns debate attack into chaotic Republican retreat. There is no good time for party leaders to call the actions of their presidential candidate “sickening” “despicable” and “vile” but such a chorus of condemnation 31 days before an election that is already sliding out of view suggests more than just the White House is at stake. Reaction to hearing Donald Trump boast of molesting women, in a tape reported by the Washington Post, was particularly fierce among Republicans in Congress, who are not only worried about losing control of the Senate but perhaps even the House of Representatives too, with this man at the top of their ticket. To see Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, describing the taped comments as showing “utter lack of respect for women” and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, quickly canceling a planned campaign event was on one level unsurprising. Even Trump is now apologising for Trump. Both have held their noses before. Ryan even once accused his party’s nominee of “textbook racism” only to stick by his previous day’s endorsement. But this time may be different, because it may be too late to take cover. Washington fears the Trump train is finally hurtling off the tracks and the question now is how many carriages will be pulled off with it before it ends in a ditch. To see why, one only needs to look at polling among women in particular, even before Trump was heard using obscene language to brag about groping. His reputation for making derogatory comments was already damaging him among key electoral groups, according to the latest polling: 56% of white women, 64% of suburban women and 67% of women with a college degree rate the Republican “unfavourably” according to the NBC and the Wall Street Journal. Even women without college degrees  —   a demographic known to be more sympathetic  —   are now negatively disposed toward him by a margin of 62% to 28%. Such sliding popularity can be seen clearly enough in the realclearpolitics. com national polling average, which puts Clinton some five points ahead after the candidates’ numbers briefly came close to touching before the last debate. But the more worrying shift has come for Trump in key swing states like Ohio and Florida, which he looked until recently to stand a good chance of winning but are now slipping dangerously out of contention. The reaction of religious conservatives in states such as Utah to the latest shocking revelations  —   leading Utah politicians Jason Chaffetz and Governor Gary Herbert rescinded their endorsements of Trump on Friday  —   indicates that a swath of Republican red states could now join blue Democratic targets and purple swing states that are lost to Trump forever, pointing to a   electoral college defeat. On Sunday night in St Louis, Trump will face Hillary Clinton in a second presidential debate that was already shaping up as a crucial, maybe final chance to change the campaign’s momentum. Now, Trump’s strategy to turn tables on the Clinton family will be hugely complicated, not least as the new revelations appear to confirm allegations of sexual assault victims who claimed he had groped them in just such a manner. Last week, Trump said he was planning to raise Bill Clinton’s infidelities to repulse female voters and unsettle his Democratic opponent after a first debate in which she appeared to get under his skin, not least with remarks about his attitude to women. “She’s nasty, but I can be nastier than she ever can be,” Trump told the New York Times. “Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics. Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it’s a serious problem for them, and it’s something that I’m considering talking about more in the near future. ” Any attempt to go negative to try to restore momentum will also be complicated by the format of Sunday’s debate in St Louis, during which members of the public will ask the candidates questions in a “town hall” event of a kind that tends to lead to more polite policy discussions than    hosted by media moderators. It is also unclear whether Trump really wants to follow through on his repeated threats to bring up Clinton personal scandals. A lawyer who represents several women to have made unproven allegations against Bill Clinton  —   including Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Dolly Kyle  —   claims that her offer to bring one of them to sit in the front row at St Louis was rebuffed by the Trump campaign, because he wanted to “take the high road” rather than focus on sleaze. The tactics adopted by Trump on Sunday will also be heavily shaped by his choice of advisers. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are thought to have played a much closer role this time around after Roger Stone and Roger Ailes  —   two media veterans without extensive political experience, the latter with a sexual harassment scandal of his own  —   were blamed for encouraging him to skip lengthy preparations for the first debate. Christie in particular has proved a highly effective and pugnacious debater in the past, helping to destroy the 2016 presidential hopes of Marco Rubio in a primary debate when he mocked the Florida senator’s habit of repeating fixed talking points. Yet fears that the Trump campaign is in freefall were exacerbated on Friday before the release of the taped remarks, by reports that it had canceled planned television advertising in key target states  —   a sign perhaps of cash shortages or that he is dialling back expectations of actually winning and wants instead to minimise the humiliation. A separate leak of a Trump tax return revealing he may have avoided paying income tax for nearly two decades by booking a loss of $916m has further dented his reputation for business acumen and empathy for   taxpayers. Clinton, meanwhile, has continued her habit of extensive preparation, though not using a   for Trump as she did before the first debate. “Hillary did a lot of town hall debates and a lot of town halls during the course of the primaries and into the general,” her campaign chairman, John Podesta, told reporters on Wednesday, after five hours of policy rehearsal over strawberries at the family home in Washington. “She’s very used to the format. She likes it. She likes answering questions from individual citizens and she listens hard and relates to people. That’s a format that Donald Trump isn’t as used to, so we’ll see. I think it’s a natural format for her and she likes really engaging with people. ” Clinton is likely to face tough questions of her own, though. New details of her highly lucrative speeches to Wall Street bankers emerged on Friday in transcripts published via WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, as leaked emails show Clinton advisers attacking Barack Obama during the last election, the period up to the next debate has seen a barrage of potential new ammunition dumped at the feet of both candidates.",-0.5
"North Korea nuclear bomb test puts ally China in tough diplomatic position. Pyongyang's claim to have tested a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday has put China, one of its few remaining allies, in a quandary as Beijing seeks to solidify its position as a global power without compromising the region's power balance. Former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs Nicholas Burns said the events represented a test for China's leaders. ""China wants to be a recognized power in Asia and globally as its military and economy grow. Great powers need to take responsibility to put out fires and deal with reckless states."" Because China is North Korea's biggest trading partner and main source of aid, it holds influence over the pariah state, making it an essential player in the current conflict. But these ties, which date back to the Korean War, have weakened since the rogue nation began testing nuclear weapons in 2006. Chinese authorities have since joined the international community in calling for denuclearization and supported United Nations (UN) sanctions. A possible sign of further deterioration in diplomatic ties is the fact that Chinese officials claimed they had no advance warning of Wednesday's test. That's unusual because Beijing tends to have the best information on what's going on in Pyongyang, noted Stuart Holliday, former U.S. ambassador for special political affairs to the United Nations (UN). So far, the Chinese Communist Party has been vocal in its condemnation of Wednesday's test but Beijing is well aware of the consequences that could have, some of which harm China itself. If sanctions are ramped up, that only further impoverishes North Koreans and risks an influx of migrants crossing the border into the mainland. Further economic strain could also push the North closer to South Korea, whose relationship with Beijing remains murky. ""Beijing doesn't want Japan and South Korea, both whom are U.S. allies, destabilized by Pyongyang's threats but on the other hand, they don't want to see a collapse of the North and the emergence of a unified Korean peninsula with a unified Korean government aligned with the U.S.,"" said Burns. Historically, Beijing has been reluctant to impose draconian sanctions on North Korea and it's unclear how forceful Chinese President Xi Jinping's administration will be this time around, as the world's second-largest economy deals with unprecedented currency depreciation, volatile stock markets and slowing factory activity. ""The Chinese have traditionally just called for more negotiations. It'll be interesting to see what happens this time especially with their economic pressure,"" noted Holliday. China's insistence that Kim abstain from nuclear escalation or risk food and energy supplies is one of the few tools the world possesses to contain North Korea, according to strategists. ""The U.S. has little leverage in respect to North Korea, but it does have leverage with China,"" explained Holliday. ""It's up to Seoul, Tokyo and Washington to insist China uses influence. If Beijing refuses, that could have repercussions for the U.S.-China relationship,"" echoed Burns, who called on President Barack Obama to phone Chinese President Xi Jinping to set the plan in motion. —Follow CNBC International on and Facebook.",0.0
"SNL gets Trump exactly right.  (CNN) Finally, Donald Trump is getting back to something he does really well: being a punchline.  Of course, this isn’t really something new to him    he had been a punchline for years before his run for president. Comedians would simply insert his name when they needed to conjure up a (more)   male version of the Kardashians.  In fact, it is probably because he was widely seen as a bit of a joke (or, at the very least, lacking substance) that GOP voters were at first unenthusiastic about Trump. A Fox News poll taken just a couple of weeks before Trump formally announced his candidacy last June, for example, found Trump with an anemic 4% of support among Republicans. And worse, 59% of GOP voters said they would ”never vote” for Trump.  But once Trump started spewing his racist and bigoted remarks, GOP voters seemed to warm to him. After his infamous presidential announcement on June 16, 2015, where he outrageously claimed Mexico was sending ”rapists” and people ”bringing drugs,” Trump’s support quickly climbed to 11% in New Hampshire, placing him second in the crowded GOP primary field.   Trump continued serving up a steady diet of demonizing immigrants, especially Latinos, and by   he was the top choice for the Republican ticket. By late November, the RealClearPolitics average of polls had him leading the GOP field by about 10 points. And even after he announced his plan to ban Muslims entering the United States? His lead grew to over 20 points.   Even more alarming than his support among Republican primary voters was that by late last month, Trump was virtually neck and neck with Hilary Clinton in national polls. But then came the first presidential debate, on September 26. With more 80 million people watching, Trump began his return to punchline status with a performance so objectively horrible that it didn’t need comedians to exaggerate it for laughs. Trump’s distractingly loud sniffling, interruptions and overall unpreparedness was clear to all.  The late night show hosts feasted. From Seth Meyers to Stephen Colbert, Trump’s first debate performance was comedy gold. And come October 1, the transformation of Trump to comedic caricature really took hold. That’s the day ”Saturday Night Live” unveiled Alec Baldwin as Trump, and it was clear from the first minute of that sketch that Baldwin’s impersonation could very well be the equivalent of Tina Fey as Sarah Palin in terms of undermining the candidate’s credibility.  After three ”SNL” debate sketches, that’s exactly what is happening. Even worse for Trump, ”SNL” just announced a special election eve show featuring more Baldwin as Trump. Vanity Fair summed up this special show perfectly with the headline: ”Saturday Night Live Is Giving Alec Baldwin an Extra Chance to Mock Donald Trump.”  If you think Trump doesn’t get that ”SNL” and other comedians could hurt    or even help completely destroy any remaining credibility    then you haven’t been paying attention. After ”SNL”’s parody of the second presidential debate, Trump was so outraged that he tweeted at 4:14 a. m. the following morning, calling for ”SNL” to be canceled: ”Watched ’Saturday Night Live’ hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!”  But the reality is that even before this election, Trump was wary of comedians ridiculing him on a national stage. Trump has, for example, lashed out at Jon Stewart over the years for mocking him, and he also allegedly slammed Seth Meyers after the   comic crushed him at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2011. Trump even sued comedian Bill Maher for $5 million over a joke Maher told on ”The Tonight Show” in 2013 that comically undercut Trump’s racist birther campaign against President Obama.   Still, ”SNL” can’t take all of the credit    Trump is helping turn himself into a laughingstock all on his own. On Tuesday, for example, the GOP nominee declared that he would ”love” to fight Joe Biden, mocking the vice president as being a ”tough guy” only when ”he’s standing behind a microphone by himself.” (The comment was in response to Biden saying he wished he could ”take [Trump] him behind the gym. ”)  None of this is to suggest that there aren’t still a lot of holdouts among Republican voters    the polls suggest that some Americans have no problem supporting Trump despite his regularly spewing sexism, racism and bigotry. And I get that some voters just want a change    that they’re uncomfortable with their party’s   too. But I hope that when they find themselves in the polling booth, that they decide not to pull the lever for a punchline. In the days between now and Election Day, we’ll see if America’s late night comedians and ”SNL” can complete their work in transforming Trump back to being a punchline    and ensure the joke isn’t on all of us instead.",-1.0
"Clinton to receive first national security briefing Saturday. Sources told Fox News that the briefing will take place at an FBI satellite office in White Plains, N. Y. near Clinton’s home in Chappaqua.  Republican nominee Donald Trump received his first briefing earlier this month at the bureau’s field office in New York City.  Republicans, including Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have called for Clinton not to be given classified information after FBI Director James Comey said last month that she had been ”extremely careless” in her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Despite that characterization, Comey said the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton for mishandling classified information. Presidential nominees do not need to have a special security clearance to receive the briefings.

"Reality check: Bill Clinton on Obamacare.  (CNN) There have been many criticisms of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. But this one came from an unexpected direction. ”You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it’s the craziest thing in the world,” former President Bill Clinton said Monday at a rally in Michigan. He also said, ”But the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.” Say what? The comments exploded into the political scene. Democrats smacked their foreheads in disbelief. Republicans clapped their hands with joy. Clinton walked them back somewhat. It is clear that Obamacare has its share of problems. For example: Several large insurance carriers have walked away from the exchanges, and as a new round of enrollment is set to begin on November 1, it is anticipated that premiums for policies purchased on the law’s exchanges will jump considerably. All this has made the law a political football. But, beyond the partisan fallout, which was and is considerable, it looks like the    has some ”splaining” to do since his analysis of the law’s   is, for the most part, dead wrong. First of all, just who is he talking about? Certainly not the nearly 56% of the population that got their health insurance through their job in 2015. Studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, two organizations that track health care costs, indicate the premiums and deductibles were rising even before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Premium increases have slowed down while deductible hikes have continued at about the same rate. Indeed, a study by Kaiser indicated that premiums for the average   family plan went up by 31% in the five years before the law was enacted, and by just 20% in the five years afterward. One reason for the flattening out was the recession, another is that the higher deductibles and   employers and insurance companies increasingly require are forcing consumers to be more thrifty in shopping for medical care.  Premiums for the most popular policies purchased on the Obamacare exchanges have risen at a slower rate than what was originally projected.  A survey of major cities in 16 states plus the District of Columbia done by Kaiser found that premiums for the most popular ”Silver” policies    the second cheapest policy available on the exchanges    increased by a mere 2% on average this year. Analysts anticipate a hefty jump of about 9% in these premiums in 2017 as several federal programs to help insurance companies hold down costs expire.  But the estimates of   premiums on the exchanges voiced by some critics are based on requests from insurance carriers. And until state regulators approve, deny or modify those requests no one    not even Bill Clinton    knows how large the premium hikes will be. And even if they are gargantuan, more than 80% of those who buy policies on the exchanges qualify for federal subsidies that keep their payments at roughly the same percentage of their incomes that they paid this year. Clinton is right when he says that the people who will be hurt the most are those who buy their insurance on the individual market, but earn too much to qualify for the subsidies. But how many people is that? Using census data, the Commonwealth Fund estimated that about 8 million people were in the private health insurance market place last year and not eligible for government help. That’s about 3. 2% of all people under the age of 65 who have health insurance. Now, 8 million people struggling is nothing to sneeze at. But is 3% of a proportion of people with health insurance enough to justify Bill Clinton calling Obamacare ”the craziest thing in the world?” So what about the law’s impact on small business? Bill Clinton also said Obamacare was hurting ”moderately successful small businesses.” But businesses with 50 employees or less    more than 90% of all small businesses    are exempt from the ACA mandate that companies provide health insurance. Until the end of 2017, those small businesses that voluntarily cover their employees are also allowed to provide   plans that do not meet the law’s requirements for minimum coverage.  To be sure, the law does place some burdens on small business and 52% of small businesses said in a survey done by the National Federation of Independent Business that rising health care costs is their number one problem. But that was also the case before Obamacare came along as can be seen by the fact that the rate of small businesses dropping health care coverage for employees is roughly the same in the years before the law was passed than it was in the years afterward. It could be what’s happened here isn’t so much that Obamacare didn’t hurt small businesses but it didn’t help them very much.",-1.0
"Cabinet Nominees Will Face Scrutiny On Climate And Education Policy This Week. The final few days before   Donald Trump takes the oath of office will be filled with a flurry of congressional activity, as the Senate holds confirmation hearings for eight more of his Cabinet nominees. Most are expected to be fairly routine, but a few could be   affairs, including hearings for Education   Betsy DeVos and Scott Pruitt, Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing to confirm several new Cabinet members shortly after Trump is sworn in as president at noon on Friday. ”I’m hopeful that we’ll get up to six or seven, particularly national security team, in place on day one,” McConnell told reporters last week after meeting with the   at Trump Tower in New York. Last week’s hearings included several national security picks, including Defense   James Mattis, who sailed through his hearing and received a congressional waiver required due to his recent military service Secretary of   Rex Tillerson, who faced very tough questions  —   particularly from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio Attorney   Jeff Sessions, who had to defend his record on race against opposition from most Democrats and civil rights groups Mike Pompeo for CIA director and John Kelly, who was nominated to run the Department of Homeland Security. This week’s hearings are for more positions that oversee domestic policy, and discussions are likely to focus on issues like climate change and the role of public education. Here’s a rundown of what’s coming up: Betsy DeVos will have her confirmation hearing before the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP) committee at 5 p. m. It was postponed from last week amid concerns of incomplete financial disclosures and ethics review. The HELP committee, however, said the delay was ”at the request of Senate leadership to accommodate Senate schedule.” On Friday evening, the Washington Post reported that DeVos had left a $150, 000   political donation off of her disclosure forms. DeVos, a billionaire GOP donor who once chaired the Michigan Republican Party, is a vocal supporter of school choice and vouchers, but doesn’t have much experience in public education. She has gotten the support of many Republicans, including some who were very critical of Trump during the campaign, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his mother, former First Lady Barbara Bush. Earlier on Tuesday, at 10 a. m. Interior   Ryan Zinke will have his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Montana Republican congressman was just sworn in to his second term and was a somewhat surprising choice for Trump, especially since he was considered to be a top GOP recruit to challenge Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester for reelection in 2018. He’s a former Navy SEAL commander who served in Iraq and was awarded two Bronze Stars. Zinke is a vocal defender of public access to federal lands, and even resigned his position as a delegate to the Republican National Committee after the party platform included support for transferring federal public lands to the states. However, environmentalists have been critical of his nomination he’s a supporter of coal, oil and gas exploration, and has backed building the Keystone XL pipeline. The middle of the week features four simultaneous confirmation hearings, all beginning at 10 a. m. The hearing for U. N. Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will round out the testimonies of major members of Trump’s foreign policy team. The South Carolina governor was no fan of Trump during the primary, even directly criticizing him during her State of the Union response last year. That alone made her a surprise choice for the position, in addition to the fact that she has little foreign policy experience, so expect Democrats to grill her on international issues. She’s the daughter of Indian immigrants and was the first woman and the first minority to lead the Palmetto State. Georgia Rep. Tom Price will also testify before the HELP Committee on his nomination to be the Health and Human Services secretary, a position that’s sure to get more scrutiny as Republicans have begun pushing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Price is an orthopedic surgeon, who has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act and proposed his own alternative. Even though he has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the New York Times reported that his nomination has, nonetheless, left many of the country’s medical professionals divided. NPR’s Scott Horsley reported that Price is under plenty of scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest as he seeks to overhaul the country’s healthcare system, but has recently taken steps to inoculate himself from many of his financial interests. The confirmation for Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, is sure to attract plenty of attention as he testifies before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He’s been a leading critic of the very agency he’s seeking to lead. Pruitt has been a leading opponent of President Obama’s environmental and climate regulations, according to NPR’s Nell Greenfieldboyce: His official biography calls him ”a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” He has repeatedly challenged the agency’s rules in court, and he has even sued the EPA for an allegedly cozy ”sue and settle” relationship with environmentalists. One profile noted that Pruitt would sue the federal government ”every chance he can get.” Pruitt is also a climate change skeptic, writing in National Review last year that: ”Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind. That debate should be encouraged  —   in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress. It should not be silenced with threats of prosecution. Dissent is not a crime.” Commerce   Wilbur Ross will also have his confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which was also postponed from last week due to ethics paperwork delays. He’s a billionaire investor and turnaround specialist. And like Trump, Ross has been a vocal opponent of free trade and supports renegotiating current trade deals. Treasury   Steven Mnuchin will testify before the Senate Finance Committee at 10 a. m. on Thursday. The wealthy hedge fund manager and former Goldman Sachs executive was Trump’s chief fundraiser during the campaign. Mnuchin will face plenty of questions about his own financial interests and how he would plan to mitigate conflicts of interest if confirmed he’s promised to divest from as many as 43 companies and funds if confirmed, as well as step down from several corporate boards. However, the New York Times reported he won’t step down as an unpaid adviser for ”Steven T. Mnuchin Inc. ,” which manages his own investments. NPR’s John Ydstie also reports that Mnuchin’s time as chairman and CEO of the California bank IndyMac, which has ”been called a foreclosure machine,” is also sure to be a major focus of the hearings. Here’s what Ydstie reported in November: Mnuchin and his partners bought IndyMac on the condition that the FDIC agree to pay future losses above a certain threshold.

"Merkel ’explains’ refugee convention to Trump in phone call. Donald Trump’s executive order to halt travel from seven   countries  —   Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia  —   has provoked a wave of concern and condemnation from international leaders and politicians. A spokesman for Angela Merkel said the German chancellor regretted Trump’s decision to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the US, adding that she had “explained” the obligations of the refugee convention to the new president in a phone call on Saturday. “The chancellor regrets the US government’s entry ban against refugees and the citizens of certain countries,” Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.  “She is convinced that the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify a general suspicion against people of a certain origin or a certain religion. “The   …     refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday. ” Seibert said the German government would examine what consequences the ban would have for German citizens with dual citizenship, and would “represent their interests, if necessary, before our American partners”. A summary of the phone call between Merkel and Trump, jointly issued to the press on Saturday, had made no mention of the travel ban, emphasising merely the “fundamental significance” of Nato and the intention to “further deepen the already excellent bilateral relations in the coming years”. The French president, François Hollande, said on Saturday that “when [Trump] rejects the arrival of refugees, while Europe has done its duty, we should respond to him”. Hollande said that in an unstable and uncertain world, “withdrawal into oneself is a   response” adding that defending democratic principles required compliance with “the principles on which it is founded, in particular the acceptance of refugees”. In a tweet, Italy’s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said his country was committed to the values that bind Europe: “Open society plural identity no discrimination. ”  However, the leader of Italy’s   Northern League party expressed admiration for Trump’s entry ban. “What Trump’s doing on the other side of the ocean, I’d like it done here, too,” said Matteo Salvini. Referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and economic migrants brought to Italy in the last few years after being rescued in the Mediterranean, Salvini said there was “an invasion under way which needs to be blocked”. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Charlie Flanagan, said that while US immigration policy was a matter for the US government, “it is clear that the most recent decisions could have   implications  —   both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community”. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, tweeted:  Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Sarif, said Trump’s decision would be recorded in history as “a great gift to extremists and their supporters   …     Collective discrimination aids terrorist recruitment by deepening faultlines exploited by extremist demagogues to swell their ranks. ” Margot Wallström, the Swedish foreign affairs minister, said she was “deeply concerned” by a decision that “creates mistrust between people”.  Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said the government would continue to work closely with the Trump administration to implement “strong border policies”. She said: “We share a common view on many issues so we will continue to work very closely with the Trump administration,” adding: “The very best days of the   relationship lie ahead. ”",-0.5
"Google’s DeepMind makes AI program that can learn like a human. Researchers have overcome one of the major stumbling blocks in artificial intelligence with a program that can learn one task after another using skills it acquires on the way. Developed by Google’s AI company, DeepMind, the program has taken on a range of different tasks and performed almost as well as a human. Crucially, and uniquely, the AI does not forget how it solved past problems, and uses the knowledge to tackle new ones. The AI is not capable of the general intelligence that humans draw on when they are faced with new challenges its use of past lessons is more limited. But the work shows a way around a problem that had to be solved if researchers are ever to build   artificial general intelligence (AGI) machines that match human intelligence. “If we’re going to have computer programs that are more intelligent and more useful, then they will have to have this ability to learn sequentially,” said James Kirkpatrick at DeepMind. The ability to remember old skills and apply them to new tasks comes naturally to humans. A regular rollerblader might find ice skating a breeze because one skill helps the other. But recreating this ability in computers has proved a huge challenge for AI researchers. AI programs are typically one trick ponies that excel at one task, and one task only. The problem arises because of the way AIs tend to work. Most AIs are based on programs called neural networks that learn how to perform tasks, such as playing chess or poker, through countless rounds of trial and error. But once a neural network is trained to play chess, it can only learn another game later by overwriting its   skills. It suffers from what AI researchers call “catastrophic forgetting”. Without the ability to build one skill on another, AIs will never learn like people, or be flexible enough to master fresh problems the way humans can. “Humans and animals learn things one after the other and it’s a crucial factor which allows them to learn continually and to build upon their previous knowledge,” said Kirkpatrick. To build the new AI, the researchers drew on studies from neuroscience which show that animals learn continually by preserving brain connections that are known to be important for skills learned in the past. The lessons learned in hiding from prey are crucial for survival, and mice would not last long if the   was erased by the skills needed to find food. The DeepMind AI mirrors the learning brain in a simple way. Before it moves from one task to another, it works out which connections in its neural network have been the most important for the tasks it has learned so far. It then makes these harder to change as it learns the next skill. “If the network can reuse what it has learned then it will do,” said Kirkpatrick. The researchers put the AI through its paces by letting it play 10 classic Atari games, including Breakout, Space Invaders and Defender, in random order. They found that after several days on each game, the AI was as good as a human player at typically seven of the games. Without the new memory consolidation approach, the AI barely learned to play one of them. In watching the AI at play, the scientists noticed some interesting strategies. For instance, when it played Enduro, a car racing game that takes place through the daytime, at night, and in snowy conditions, the AI treated each as a different task. Writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how the new AI solved problems with skills it had learned in the past. But it is not clear whether drawing on past skills made the AI perform better. While the program learned to play different games, it did not master each one as well as a dedicated AI would have. “We have demonstrated that it can learn tasks sequentially, but we haven’t shown that it learns them better because it learns them sequentially,” Kirkpatrick said. “There’s still room for improvement. ” One reason the AI did not nail each game was that it sometimes failed to appreciate how important certain connections were for its playing strategy. “We know that sequential learning is important, but we haven’t got to the next stage yet, which is to demonstrate the kind of learning that humans and animals can do. That is still a way off. But we know that one thing that was considered to be a big block is not insurmountable,” Kirkpatrick said. “We are still a really long way from   artificial intelligence and there are many research challenges left to solve,” he added. “One key part of the puzzle is building systems that can learn to tackle new tasks and challenges while retaining the abilities that they have already learnt. This research is an early step in that direction, and could in time help us build   systems that can learn more flexibly and efficiently. ” Peter Dayan, director of the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London, called the work “extremely nice”. He said that for computers to achieve AGI, they will need to learn how one task relates to another, so that past skills can efficiently be brought on bear on new problems. Alan Winfield, at the Bristol Robotics Lab at the University of the West of England said the work was “wonderful” but added: “I don’t believe it brings us significantly closer to AGI, since this work does not, nor does it claim to, show us how to generalise from one learned capability to another. Something you and I were able to do effortlessly as children. ”",-0.5
"Trump 101: He plans rapid, radical gutting of government regulations. One of the most fervent, but least discussed, elements of President Trump's master plan is the deconstruction of the regulatory state — hobbling EPA, Interior, Energy and more in a bid to — as aides see it— ""open up the animal spirits of the economy."" You might call his Cabinet secretaries of the domestic departments ""the gutters."" Internally, they are known by some as ""deconstructors,"" the men and one woman (Betsy Devos at the Department of Education) tapped because of their shared view in eviscerating key pieces of the agencies they will run. The blueprint became visible when we connected the dots in department-by-department and agency-by-agency conversations. And when top advisers talked about what animated the selections of very conservative, very anti-government picks for the agencies with big regulatory reach. A senior transition source said: ""This is an important area that has flown under the radar among Democrats, and even Republicans and conservatives. President Trump plans to attack the regulatory state from every angle. The government has been captured by elites, which gets to the very core of what animates the president."" How this will unfold: According to internal administration documents that we viewed, plans include withdrawing or suspending major Obama rules that were not finalized; reopening major rules that have been finalized if they have ""highly negative economic consequences""; suspending ""forthcoming grants to non-profit groups and universities pending review""; and suspending some hires in progress. A Republican lobbyist told us after meetings in Trump Tower and the West Wing that the Trump plan is clever because it undermines the regulatory machine, which the president can do by executive action, rather than trying to dismantle the machinery, which requires congressional approval and would be difficult to achieve quickly. The targets: Environmental Protection Agency: Top priorities include unwinding Obama's Clean Power Plan and regulations for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Trump insiders also want to reopen the process for determining the appropriate fuel economy standards (CAFE). Department of the Interior: Re-open the so-called five-year leasing plan, which is used to determine the offshore areas available for energy exploration. Department of Energy: Freeze on all regulations, loan guarantees, and deployment of energy technologies. The plan is to evaluate all of them on a case-by-case basis and unwind the elements of Obama's Climate Action Plan under the purview of the DOE. Department of Education: There are two big potential actions that some of his education advisers are pushing. Creating a tax credit program to support the educational needs of students is one idea. Making Title I funding portable is another. Title I funding makes up the largest portion of federal education spending. Currently the funding – which goes to poor kids – is given to public schools to administer. Some senior Trump officials wanted to give that money directly to families to use as they see fit (which could mean private schools.) That act alone would be highly disruptive and would enrage progressives. Another major — and less discussed — priority is likely to be reforming Obama's federal loan programs for higher education. Trump insiders believe the federal government has gone way beyond its proper bounds as a loans provider. The power behind the throne: Much like the nationalistic inaugural speech, and today's push for new immigration restrictions, the quick-strike, hard-line approach to gutting regulation was championed by strategist Steve Bannon and policy guru Stephen Miller, among others.

"Poll: Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6. Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 6 percentage points, according to a new USA   University poll.  Clinton’s 46% to 40% edge is a tighter margin than the poll has found in the past, suggesting that Trump is narrowing the advantage Clinton has had since the two became their parties’ presumptive nominees. Just two months ago, the same poll showed Clinton up 11 points.  The poll also found high interest in the election    though much of what Americans are expressing is concern.  It found 61% said they are alarmed by the 2016 presidential race, while 23% are excited    and just 9% are bored.

"Obama Says Guantanamo Prison Doesn’t Help U.S. Security, ’It Undermines It’. U. S. operation of the Guantanamo Bay military detention center in Cuba is ”contrary to our values” and is seen as ”a stain on our broader record” of upholding the highest rules of law, President Obama said Tuesday as he announced plans to close the facility. The administration’s proposal is ”not expected to go very far,” as the   reported earlier today. Devised by the Pentagon, the plan outlines how a shutdown might work  —   something that was requested by Congress. But it comes months after lawmakers from both parties approved legislation that prohibits the president from moving detainees onto U. S. soil. Obama made his case for the plan at a live event at the White House. ”For many years it’s been clear that the detention center at Guantanamo Bay does not advance our national security,” he said. ”It undermines it.” The president added that this wasn’t his opinion alone, but one that’s shared by military advisers  —   and he said that the facility provides a recruiting and propaganda tool for terrorist groups such as ISIS and also hurts America’s relationships with its allies. ”Let us do what is right for America,” Obama said, seeking to close a chapter in the country’s fight against terrorism. Several times during his speech, Obama invoked his predecessor, President George W. Bush, noting that Bush oversaw the facility’s use to house suspected terrorists  —   and also wanted to close the prison. ”I give him credit for that,” Obama said, calling it ”an honest assessment on his part on his part of what needed to happen.” Toward the end of his remarks, the president said, ”I don’t want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is. And if as a nation we don’t deal with this now, when will we deal with it?” Responding to Obama’s plan, the American Civil Liberties Union’s executive director, Anthony D. Romero, applauded the effort to close Guantanamo  —   but he added, ”his decision to preserve the   military commissions is a mistake.” Romero also said that the president’s ”continuing embrace of indefinite detention without charge or trial will tarnish his legacy.” More than a third of the current occupants at the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay are now eligible to be transferred to other countries, the White House says. Although Republican majorities in the House and Senate are not inclined to go along, the Pentagon plan will fulfill an obligation created by Congress for Obama to at least file such a plan and move the onus for action onto Capitol Hill. ”The politics of this are tough,” the president said Tuesday, noting that many Americans remain highly concerned about terrorism  —   and the prospect of holding terrorists prisoner here in the U. S. Defense officials have been surveying sites inside the United States to see how well they might do as the new homes for Guantanamo detainees. There are 46 detainees whom U. S. officials consider too dangerous to release because of the potential threat they might pose, along with 10 others who are either charged or convicted by military commissions. Another 35 detainees held at Guantanamo since the George W. Bush administration are awaiting transfer to other countries. The Pentagon has looked at military and federal prisons in South Carolina, Kansas and Colorado. Its report could include the details of what work each one would require as a potential stateside successor to Guantanamo, but is not expected to pick one over the other. NPR’s David Welna, who just returned from a week covering military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, has visited two of the sites the Pentagon has considered. The mayor of Leavenworth, Kan. home to a maximum security Army prison, told Welna she is ”absolutely against” the idea of Guantanamo detainees moving there. Many locals in Canon City, Colo. also oppose the idea of hosting the terror suspects, but as home to a prison complex that includes the   federal ”Supermax,” they know why their area makes sense. ”I suppose I would prefer not to have war criminals or war prisoners in our community,” Canon City Mayor Tony Greer told Welna. ”On the other hand, we are a prison community. And if I were assigned the task from Washington to choose a site, certainly this would be on my short list.”",-0.5
"Coinbase gets approval from U.S. regulators to start listing tokenized securities – TechCrunch. Coinbase shared big news Monday that federal regulators are allowing the popular cryptocurrency exchange to proceed with plans to sell cryptocurrency tokens that are deemed securities. Last month, Coinbase acquired Keystone Capital, a California-based FINRA-registered broker-dealer that operates as an alternative trading system. With the announcement, the SF-based cryptocurrency exchange disclosed that it would still need to get regulatory approval to operate under the Keystone licenses. Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority gave Coinbase just that, Bloomberg reported, approving that deal alongside the acquisitions of Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth. Coinbase confirmed these details to TechCrunch as well. Today’s news opens up the scope of Coinbase’s ambitions to the billions of dollars that have been raised in initial coin offerings over the past several months. With permission to trade tokenized securities, Coinbase users could soon have the ability to move beyond the limited cryptocurrency options currently available to be traded on the site’s central exchange which currently just lists Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. The company announced last week that it was exploring adding five new tokens to its exchange, including Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Stellar Lumens, Zcash and 0x. In a blog post, the company specified that the announcement did not necessarily deem that these tokens were not securities and that classification might vary by jurisdiction.",0.0
" Bill Nye And The Science March’s White-Dude Drama.  On Thursday, after at least a week of contentious deliberations, the popular March for Science movement will announce three people to lead its April 22 protest in Washington, DC. Two are prominent scientists and vocal advocates for diversity in science: Mona   the pediatrician who first exposed dangerous lead poisoning among the mostly poor black kids in Flint, Michigan, and Lydia   a molecular biologist famous for helping to figure out how to get bacteria to make insulin. The march’s third leader is the only bona fide celebrity: ‘90s   phenomenon Bill Nye. Since his hit TV show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, went off the air in 1998, Nye has become a tireless public defender of science, from arguing with Tucker Carlson over climate change to debunking the creationist claim that dinosaurs and humans ever coexisted on our planet. “People are denying the facts of science in the world’s most influential economy,” Nye told BuzzFeed News. “We’re marching to remind everybody of how much science serves you, a person, as a citizen in our society. ” The March for Science, which hopes to replicate the success of the Women’s March on Washington, now has nearly 2 million supporters across social media platforms, more than 100 scientific groups signed on as partners, 428 satellite marches planned for cities across the globe, and 100, 000 volunteers. But much like its sister protest, the science march has also spent most of its short lifetime steeped in tense debates about what  —   and who  —   it is taking a stand for. As recently as last week, Nye was slated to be the march’s first honorary  . But after a fresh round of complaints that the group was not taking diversity issues seriously enough,   and   both women of color who have long fought for science to serve communities it has traditionally left behind, were added to the lineup. Since the march’s inception at the end of January, critics have repeatedly slammed the organizers for saying that the march should be about championing science, not mixing it up with politics. So when it came to choosing public faces for the march, the organizers were struggling to figure out how not to screw up again. “He is a white male, and in that way he does represent the status quo of science, of what it is to be a scientist. ” “I love Bill Nye,” said Stephani Page, a biophysicist at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who created the Twitter hashtag #BlackAndSTEM. Page was asked to join the march’s board in February after she tweeted criticism of its approach to diversity. “But I do feel comfortable saying to you what I said to the steering committee: He is a white male, and in that way he does represent the status quo of science, of what it is to be a scientist. ” Adding   and   she said, “was an opportunity to put up a picture of science that did not just fit the white male image. ” These intense arguments about diversity in the march reflect a much broader debate about science itself. The institution that prides itself on its objectivity has always been plagued by questions over who participates in it, who it serves, and who it leaves behind. “This is a tense topic, period,” Page said. “But part of telling the whole story is that what’s happening in the science march is really what’s happening in science. It’s just bubbling up really quickly. ” The March for Science’s origin story starts, as tales of nerdom often do, on Reddit. On the day President Trump was sworn into office, it appeared that all references to climate change had been scrubbed from the White House’s website. Scientists, already stressed about the prospect of budget cuts to research and the rise of climate denialism, were incensed. “There needs to be a Scientists’ March on Washington,” one person commented on an   thread about the news, a reference to the historic 1963 March on Washington led by civil rights activists and Martin Luther King Jr. Hours later, the group had a logo (now a globe held inside an atom) a Facebook group, and thousands of followers. But almost immediately, problems cropped up, playing out publicly on Twitter and Facebook. Many scientists felt alienated by the march’s apolitical stance, arguing that it denied the experiences of the minorities President Trump was most fiercely attacking and who have felt excluded from science, too. Responding to this criticism, the organizers tried to show that they stood with all scientists. “Colonization, racism, immigration, native rights, sexism, ableism,       and econ justice are scientific issues,” an organizer tweeted, following with a raised fist and a rainbow emoji. The next day, the group released an updated diversity statement, claiming that issues like sexual harassment, disability, LGBTQIA rights, clean water access, and mass shootings “are scientific issues. ” But not everyone was pleased with the march’s attempts to broaden its vision. In response to the diversity statement, famous Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker tweeted: “Scientists’ March on Washington plan compromises its goals with        rhetoric. ” Scientists’ March on Washington plan compromises its goals with        rhetoric https:  .  The organizers never publicly responded to Pinker, but deleted the original tweet and took out some of the language that had been added to the diversity statement. “Glad to see that the March for Science Web site has removed the distractions. It’s an important event,” Pinker tweeted in response. This    and the organizers’ seeming willingness to bend to those who believed the political discussions were detracting from the true message of the march, angered many scientists. But others argued that focusing on identity politics would hurt the march’s chances of being taken seriously in Washington. Two days later, the march’s lead organizer, Jonathan Berman, was quoted in the New York Times: “Yes, this is a protest, but it’s not a political protest. ” “It took one tweet by one   male scientist for the organizers to completely retreat from the diversity statement that they put out,” Zuleyka Zevallos, a sociologist at Swinburne University in Australia, told BuzzFeed News. “It’s important because it shows that there’s a wavering commitment to diversity that is swayed by the status quo in science. ” One month and four diversity statements later, the group is trying to prove its commitment: It now has a diversity coordinator, and a steering committee composed of several women of color. “At best, I misspoke. At worst, I was wrong,” Berman told BuzzFeed News last week, referring to his quote about science not being political. In fact, Berman said he and Nye considered this exact question back in 2007, after Berman saw the celeb give a talk at the University of Rochester. “The question I asked Bill then was, ‘Is it okay for scientists to become politically involved, or should we just let the data fall as they may and stay out of the political discussion?’ His answer to me 10 years ago was, ‘Absolutely we need to be part of the political discussion, this is our role. ’” Berman and the other march organizers had planned to announce Nye as their first honorary   last week, but held off after realizing it might be received badly. In an interview with BuzzFeed News before this change, Nye seemed baffled when asked about the diversity issues surrounding the march. “With respect to diversity  —   is that the key word here? There’s a diversity committee on the march, and they’re working this problem,” he said. “I was born a dorky white guy who became an engineer. I’m playing the hand I was dealt. We can’t  —   this march can’t solve every problem all at once. ” The organizers pulled the announcement later that day, deciding to add   who would better represent the diversity in science. “We did talk internally about the optics of having the first person to be announced be only a white man. ” “We did talk internally about the optics of having the first person to be announced be only a white man,” Berman told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, though he stressed that wasn’t the sole reason they added   and  . For Mona   diversity is “part and parcel” of what it means to do her job. She made headlines in 2016 after announcing data showing that the number of children in Flint, Michigan, with elevated lead levels had almost doubled after a switch in their water supply. “Science has taught us that there is no safe level of lead, and that lead disproportionately impacts a vulnerable population  —   it’s already an environmental injustice,”   said. “The science in Flint was irrefutable, yet it was dismissed and it was attacked. ” As for the science march’s diversity debates,   argues that if science’s goal is to improve our communities, diversity is also inherent in that discussion. “This is part of the work that we’re doing,” she said. These fights are also crucial to Lydia   whose nonprofit SACNAS aims to help its 20, 000 Latino and Native American members get advanced degrees and careers in STEM. “For a very long time I have felt that just because I am a scientist does not free me from my responsibility in my community,”   told BuzzFeed News. “As for those folks who feel that it’s a mistake to talk about anything but the doing of experiments, to not include diversity in a discussion of science, I think that’s shortsighted. ” For all of the turmoil of the last two months, some outsiders are optimistic that the march’s organizers have taken the criticism to heart. “Finding ways together to get past biases is the whole point of the scientific method,” Janet Stemwedel, a philosopher of science at San Jose State University, told BuzzFeed News. “So if we’re seeing a little bit of that in how the march planning is coming together, maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe we should recognize what that’s worth. ”  ",-1.0
"Tesla Hits a New Milestone, Passing G.M. in Valuation - The New York Times. Tesla has quietly zoomed past another automotive milestone. Just a week after the company surpassed Ford Motor in market value, its shares closed at $312. 39 on Monday, making Tesla worth about $50. 9 billion, slightly more than General Motors. G. M. like Ford Motor, has been operating for more than 100 years, and in the first quarter of 2017, it sold hundreds of thousands more vehicles than Tesla, an electric car upstart, did in all of 2016. But investors are betting that Tesla, whose chief executive is Elon Musk, has room to grow as the world’s appetite for electric vehicles expands. Tesla said on April 2 that its   sales had risen 69 percent from the same period a year ago. The next day, Ford and G. M. released disappointing sales figures. Although the big automakers are financially healthy and produce the   types of vehicles, like trucks and sport utility vehicles, they are perceived as lagging in   technology like alternative power and autonomy. Tesla’s first electric vehicle, the Roadster, rolled off the assembly line in 2008, and its Autopilot feature has been included since 2015. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S. U. V. which sell for $90, 000 including options. The Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35, 000, is expected to debut this summer and be produced in significantly higher volumes.",-1.0
"Tensions at DNC could preview bitter leadership fight. With the party relegated to the Washington wilderness, tempers reportedly flared on Thursday at DNC officials’ first meeting since the election. Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, whom   emails reveal had been privately aiding Hillary Clinton since the primaries, apparently was confronted by one DNC staffer.  “You are part of the problem. You and your friends will die of old age and I’m going to die from climate change,” the staffer told Brazile, according to The Huffington Post. He reportedly asked why they should trust her to lead, saying, ”You backed a flawed candidate.”  Brazile has not publicly announced any intention to seek the   position, saying only it’s the responsibility of the interim chair to ”complete the work of this cycle.”   Perhaps indicating she plans to step back, Brazile tweeted that the ”next Chair” must earn support and confidence and teased that she’d “make several important and vital announcements” next week.   Already, several Democratic figures    some controversial in their own right    have put their names in the running for chairman. With no obvious heir to the leadership role inhabited by President Obama, the race for the DNC top slot is shaping up to be a battle within the left wing of the party.  See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → Former presidential candidate and   governor Martin O’Malley said Friday he is taking “a hard look” at running because the party needs to “articulate a bold progressive vision. ” He joins another former presidential candidate,   Vermont governor and former DNC boss Howard Dean, who announced after the election he’ll run for his old job. The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again. Expected to jump in soon is Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Fox News has confirmed he plans to announce his bid for DNC chairman on Monday    and the congressman already is being backed by   support.  ”We need a Democratic National Committee led by a progressive who understands the dire need to listen to working families, not the political establishment or the billionaire class. That is why I support Keith Ellison to be the next Chair of the Democratic National Committee, and why I hope you’ll join me in advocating for him to lead the DNC,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost the   Democratic primaries to Clinton and continues to enjoy widespread support among voters, said in a statement. Another popular figure on the left, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, tipped her hat toward Ellison. ”I really, really like Keith,” Warren told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. ”I think he’s terrific and I think he would make a terrific DNC chair.” New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is in line to be Senate Minority Leader, also reportedly backed the first Muslim to be elected to Congress. The election of any of these candidates to helm the DNC would signal the party plans to double down on the liberal vision espoused by Sanders during the primaries    and adopted to a degree by Clinton during the general election.  Ellison, who   a bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney, could be a controversial choice. Shortly after his election in 2007, he compared President George W. Bush to Hitler and has been linked to the radical Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Brazile, meanwhile, is slated to remain as interim chair until March 2017. However, a MoveOn. org campaign has been launched to hold the leadership vote earlier. Brazile was the DNC’s vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation and a paid CNN contributor before she was tapped on July 24 to replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The Florida congresswoman resigned after WikiLeaks exposed her apparent bias in favor of Hillary Clinton. Brazile was no less a controversial figure. In the final weeks of the campaign, Wikileaks released a series of emails that showed Al Gore’s former campaign manager allegedly provided the Clinton campaign with questions in advance of primary debates and town halls with Sanders.

In July 2015, President Obama negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran  —   after promising us he would never agree to a deal giving Tehran nuclear weapons  —   doing exactly that. While he and Clinton boasted they stopped Iran’s nuclear program without firing a shot, that shot will ultimately be a nuclear one fired by Iran. In an agreement even more   than U. K. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s 1938 deal with Germany’s Adolf Hitler that was supposed to guarantee “peace for our time” but ultimately failed, President Obama paved the way for the mullahs to have nukes either sooner (if they violate the deal) or later (if they abide by it). The deal’s supporters probably took comfort believing, just as the concept of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) kept the former Soviet Union and the U. S. from initiating a nuclear attack against each other, the thought of U. S. retaliation would ensure Tehran’s mullahs also kept their nukes sheathed. But such comfort dissipates upon heeding the words of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who first put Tehran on the path to obtaining a nuclear arsenal. Khomeini, whose ultimate goal was for Islam to dominate the world, made it clear he did not fear such retaliation. In 1980, he said: “We do not worship Iran, we worship Allah. For patriotism is another name for paganism. I say let this land burn. I say let this land go up in smoke, provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world. ” There should be no doubt, as Iran’s spiritual leader, Khomeini was willing to sacrifice the entire country (“let this land go up in smoke”) if that was the price to pay for Islam to emerge “triumphant in the rest of the world. ” As our media focused public attention on the presidential candidates’ personal issues, it left more important issues concerning this national security threat in the shadows. Again, there will be supporters of the deal who believe Iran only seeks nukes to be able to respond in an uncertain world. But one need only reflect on Tehran’s   global aggression to realize what a   Iran is capable of doing. In fulfillment of its extraterritorial constitutional mandate, one totally contrary to any other state’s constitution, Iran has been spreading its Islamic Revolution throughout the Middle East. The mullahs have targeted Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, the Palestinian territories, and Latin America. Even as nuclear negotiations were ongoing and Obama considered military action against Syria in 2013 for using chemical weapons, Iran brazenly threatened brutal attacks against Americans and even Obama’s family if he did so. Since the 2015 nuclear agreement was reached, the number of U. S. naval confrontations with Iran have doubled, accompanied with threats to shoot down U. S. spy planes in international airspace. Undeterred by international law, Iran most recently boasted its enemies are not safe “as the revolutionary forces will chase them and kill them anywhere in the world. ” A leadership that believes it is   to establish Islam as the global religion and boasts it is unconstrained by international borders and law to do so is capable of using all means at its disposal to achieve that end. Once it is nuclear armed, we will better understand this. For supporters who naively believe the nuclear agreement stopped Iran’s nuclear arms program, they not only ignore the failure of that deal to implement verifiable inspections but also ignore that the mullahs are using North Korea as its research lab for nuclear arms and missile development. Despite knowing this was being done, Obama inserted no restrictions upon Tehran in the agreement to continue doing so. Iranian scientists and military observers have always been present at Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests. It is absurd to suggest Obama’s nuclear deal halted Iran’s research. Additionally, it later came to light Obama made several “secret”   as part of Iran’s nuclear agreement that were not disclosed to Congress at the time. Had their details been shared with Clinton, perhaps we would all know their content now by reading her emails. As Clinton has strongly endorsed Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, it is doubtful she will do anything to deter Iran’s march to a weaponization. If four years of a Clinton administration does not see Iran complete that march, eight years definitely will see it become a reality. And a nuclear weapon in Tehran’s arsenal will gather no dust. Only two questions will remain at that point: where will it be detonated and what will be the means of delivery? When the big bang is heard, the mullahs will rejoice in Tehran with no fear of facing the consequences of their actions. For them, retaliation is simply their ticket to the afterlife guaranteed to those who further Islam’s cause, unabashedly leaving behind a world in chaos, suffering and destruction for  .

"Bane of our existence: Trump speech has uncanny echo of Batman villain. Donald Trump has been compared to many things, but until now the Batman villain Bane had probably not been among them. In his inaugural address on Friday, the new US president said his arrival in office had “special meaning” because “we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people”. As many were quick to point out on Twitter, that line had an uncanny echo of one spoken by Bane, the masked villain played by Tom Hardy in Christopher Nolan’s 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. “We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you   …     the people,” Bane declares in the movie.

"’And the Oscar will go to’ … who shall win the 2017 Academy Awards, and why. Damien Chazelle’s heartbroken contemporary musical is unbeatable, with a   14 nominations, a global   haul of more than £270m and a trophy cabinet already stacked with key precursor awards, from the New York Critics Circle to the Producers Guild of America to its whopping haul at the Golden Globes. The only question is how emphatically it’s going to sweep the Oscars. La La Land is so far in the lead, it’s hard to tell what’s even running second. Moonlight was shaping up as a spoiler, but has lost momentum to uplifting crowdpleaser Hidden Figures, the surprise victor at the Screen Actors Guild awards. In recent years, the Academy has proven more willing than previously to split the best picture and director awards, but it’s hard to see that happening this time. At 32, Whiplash director Damien Chazelle will become the youngest best director winner in Oscars history. After all, La La Land is so wholly and vigorously the product of its  ’s romantic vision that the Academy will want to honour his moxie in pulling off what might once have seemed a Hollywood folly. Crucially, he also has the Directors Guild award, which has only diverged from the Academy’s choice seven times in 69 years. Casey Affleck was sweeping all the   awards for his understated but devastating turn as a handyman riven by guilt and grief, despite lingering negative publicity from sexual harassment allegations. Then the Screen Actors Guild threw a spanner in the works by preferring Denzel Washington’s booming cinematic replay of his   stage triumph in Fences, and all bets were off. SAG has anticipated the Oscar winner in this category for 12 years straight, but Hollywood darling Washington wasn’t even nominated for the Bafta, which duly went to Affleck. It’s a nailbiter, but I expect the more   “big” performance to edge it, with Washington joining the likes of Meryl Streep in the elite   club. The Academy loves a winsome ingenue in this category, and    Stone fits the bill: she rose steadily through the ranks on her goofball charm and showbiz smarts, scored a supporting nod two years ago for Birdman, and is now set to take the big one for so persuasively nailing the threadbare hope and   of aspiring actors on the Hollywood audition hamster wheel. There are rumblings of an upset by Golden Globes winner Isabelle Huppert, who has worked the campaign circuit like a pro, and whose chilly, gutsy performance as a   rape victim in Paul Verhoeven’s Elle dwarfs Stone’s for daring and finesse. But as Huppert’s compatriot Emmanuelle Riva learned a few years back, a Hollywood princess is hard to beat. After a run of critics’ award victories, the   House of Cards star has had an    trajectory. In a shocker, he lost a Golden Globe to Aaron   (who made way for his Nocturnal Animals   Michael Shannon on the Oscar shortlist) before rebounding with a Screen Actors Guild win, accompanied by a powerful speech that referenced his   identity. At the Baftas, however, he lost again  —   to Lion’s masquerading lead actor Dev Patel. Is Ali’s   early exit performance in Moonlight too subtle to prevail with some voting groups? Possibly. But the Academy will want to show support for Barry Jenkins’ film in at least one major category. This has been the most    of the four acting races ever since it was announced that Davis, who won the best actress Tony for her stirring,     work as an underestimated housewife in August Wilson’s play, would be campaigning in the supporting race for the film version. Golden Globes, SAG and Bafta wins duly followed. A consummate actors’ actor, well overdue for Oscar recognition, Davis would likely have marched to victory in either category. As it is, spare a thought for likely   Michelle Williams for Manchester by the Sea, who lacerates your heart in a fraction of Davis’ screen time. One of the closest races of the night, depending on just how besotted with La La Land the Academy turns out to be. It’s quite conceivable that Academy voters will favour Chazelle’s film as much as Globes voters  —   who gave it the screenplay award, despite consensus that it is more a triumph of direction and    than writing. If Oscars voters are in a more discerning,   mood, expect Bafta champ Lonergan  —   hailed as one of the American cinema’s great working dramatists  —   to take this for richer, more rounded character work. This season there’s been disagreement between awards bodies over which writing category Moonlight should compete in. Some (including Bafta and the Writers Guild of America) thought the film’s relationship to McCraney’s unproduced play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue was distant enough for Moonlight to qualify as original. The Academy, however, deemed it an adaptation, giving it a clearer path to victory in the less competitive category. Bafta winner Lion might have a remote shot, but it’s hard to see voters passing up the chance to honour Barry Jenkins’ achievement  —   thus making him the first black   to win. Historically prone to upsets, this is the one major category this year that could go one of more than two ways. If it were up to critics, Maren Ade’s offbeat   comedy Toni Erdmann would win in a walk. But while the Academy has recently been guided by critical consensus in this category, the film’s eccentric humour,   structure and   petit fours aren’t for everyone. (It lost at the Baftas and Golden Globes.)   options might be the sturdy Danish second world war drama Land of Mine  —   the Academy never tires of the subject  —   or Sweden’s heartwarmer A Man Called Ove. But in a tight race, politics might put Asghar Farhadi’s solid, Arthur   suspense drama The Salesman a nose ahead. Farhadi, who won in 2012 for A Separation, has made better films, but his   in response to Donald Trump’s attempted travel ban will earn him a lot of support from Academy liberals. After taking the Golden Globe for animated film and ruling the animation industry’s Annie awards, Disney’s bright, zippy, whirringly clever animal allegory for contemporary identity politics has the clear advantage over its     rival Moana. A divided vote, however, could pave the way for Laika’s artier   adventure Kubo and the Two Strings to repeat its surprise Bafta victory. There is a lot of admiration in the industry for the smaller film’s exquisite craftsmanship  —   it even scored an unlikely visual effects nod  —   but perhaps more for Zootopia’s cheery leftwing topicality. It may seem less of a big deal in Britain, but in the US, public fascination with the OJ Simpson story isn’t going anywhere. The dramatised The People v OJ Simpson has swept up TV prizes, and Ezra Edelman’s   investigation has been similarly dominant on the documentary awards circuit  —   despite complaints in some quarters that the project, aired as a   miniseries on ESPN, shouldn’t compete as a feature film. I suspect the Academy won’t share those qualms, but if they do, look for new industry darling Ava DuVernay’s stirring civil rights doc 13th to benefit. Greig Fraser’s sunburnt,   work on Lion beat the glistening,   surfaces of La La Land to the American Society of Cinematographers award, and could do so here  —   voters do love a spectacular landscape in this category, after all. But technical categories at the Oscars are voted on by the entire membership, not just peers in the discipline at hand, which probably gives the advantage to Linus Sandgren’s grabby,   imagery on the    frontrunner. As for Martin Scorsese’s Silence, sure to lose in its lone category, it’ll settle for the impassioned “it wuz robbed” cries of Oscar sceptics for years to come.",-0.5
"Remember the time Donald Trump killed a sports league? | TheHill. Eddie the Hat, my sports betting consultant, and occasional seat mate in the press box at Santa Anita during Thoroughbred racing season, can read a racing form like nobody’s business.  I won’t bore you with the details, but putting the figures together and understanding the differences between distance, class, surface and works usually boils down to a cliche. “Why did you go with that broken down nag Eddie?” “Frankie, You can’t predict the future without first knowing the past.” Sounds wise doesn’t it? In truth, degenerate sports bettors are some of the wisest people in this country right now. You can’t lose hundreds of thousands of dollars without getting educated about the ways of the world.

League founder David Dixon studied what made the NFL work and developed a pretty ambitious plan to take on the stagnating No Fun League. The plan, rolled out nationwide in 1983, included:  — Instant replay (unimaginable at that time in the NFL);  — Two-point conversions (also not part of the NFL’s package in the 1980s); — A TV deal (which he negotiated with still young ESPN and ABC); — Franchises in towns that could support the league; — A strict salary cap and budget for each team, so that the nascent league could survive its first decade, and most radically, a schedule that played games in the spring, instead of fall. It worked great for a year. Then Donald Trump bought the New Jersey Generals and entered the league’s ownership ranks with a “yuuge” plan to make the USFL the greatest league ever.  His plan relied on dissatisfaction with the league’s direction after a season. And, he blamed a rigged media for keeping the league off the air and out of the newspapers.  As for Dixon’s meticulous plan? Trump hated it.  He disagreed with the salary cap — signing stars like Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie. He hated the league’s austerity plan, and believed it was all wrong to play games in the spring. His cynical marketing plan was designed to manipulate fans not draw them into a relationship with the new league. Trump once explained his proposal to make football great again in a televised interview with Keith Jackson before a March 1984 game with the Birmingham Stallions. It was probably Trump’s last visit to Birmingham before this year’s Super Tuesday. “I disagree with the way it was handled last year frankly I’ve been very open about that. You have to go out you have to get the stars. Last year it started off reasonably strong. This year it’s going to stay strong you are going to see a very big week next week, you are going to see a huge week the following week. It’s going to stay strong. It’s going to stay strong for a long time.” Trump coaxed his fellow USFL owners into moving games to the fall to go head-to-head with the NFL. Trump was trying to incite a merger and gain entry into the elite class of NFL owners. It didn’t work. Trump’s self-serving baloney and contemptuous disregard for Dixon’s plan ultimately led to the demise of the USFL. Trump and most of the owners split. Dixon was left holding the bag on a failed venture and brought Raiders owner Al Davis in to testify against the NFL in an unfair business practices lawsuit.  The USFL won exactly $1 in court, plus triple damages. The NFL wrote a check for $3 and laughed all the way to the bank.  And we all know what happened to the USFL innovations like the two-point conversion, replay and deals with ESPN. The NFL adopted them all. Best $3 spent in the history of American business.  As for Trump?

"Do marijuana prisoners deserve amnesty? (Opinion).  (CNN) What to do with the prisoners of a failed war?   Since 2012, when voters in Colorado and Washington approved the tax and sale of recreational marijuana, the cognitive dissonance of America’s drug penalties has become even more absurd.   Where we once incarcerated people for growing and selling ”just a plant,” we’re now incarcerating people for growing and selling ”just a plant” that tens of millions of people can grow and sell legally.  Marijuana is legal only in certain states, and illegal under federal law. Still, it’s worth asking what Congress would do with the thousands of pot offenders sent to federal prison each year if we repealed, or even just reformed, federal pot laws.  In 2010, Congress voted to change federal penalties for crack cocaine with the Fair Sentencing Act. Prior to the law’s passage, 5 grams of crack cocaine triggered the same mandatory minimum sentence as 500 grams of powder cocaine. Congress reduced that disparity, from    to    which significantly reduced crack cocaine sentences. But Congress did nothing to change the sentences of the more than 8, 000 federal crack prisoners who were locked up when the bill was signed into law.    So the repeal of federal marijuana laws could likely leave us with many thousands of federal pot prisoners serving sentences longer than what they’d receive in a   courtroom.      What to do with these prisoners becomes all the more pressing when you consider that people still die in prison for marijuana offenses. In fiscal year 2013, more than 40% of all people who received life without parole sentences in federal courts were drug offenders, and 6% of those were marijuana sellers, according to the U. S. Sentencing Commission.  If Congress changes marijuana laws without allowing currently imprisoned pot offenders to seek new sentences, should this president or the next simply throw open the gates?    Clemency feels particularly appropriate for marijuana prisoners, who sit in cells for trafficking and dealing while state legislators argue over how to spend the revenues generated from pot taxes and newspapers tell us how to incorporate the plant in our cooking.  It should be cruel and unusual, indeed, to mete out     for a drug so mainstream that Colorado is using   pot taxes to build new schools. In 2014,   Attorney General James Cole announced a Justice Department initiative to review the petitions of federal prisoners serving sentences longer than what they’d receive if sentenced today, and to grant clemency to those whose early release would not compromise public safety. The second wave of clemencies granted since the initiative launched included both crack offenders and a single marijuana offender.  But clemency, by its very nature, benefits only a small number of people. Even if President Obama were to grant 2, 000 commutations over the next 21 months  —   an unprecedented number  —   there are roughly 100, 000 drug offenders in federal prison. The vast majority would be left to serve excessively long sentences. Our drug policies    and not just those pertaining to marijuana    require sweeping, comprehensive, grand reform.  Federal drug laws across the board, as well as drug laws in states that have yet to embrace reform, are irreconcilable with   practices that actually reduce addiction and crime.     mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses are particularly arbitrary, harsh, insanely expensive, and, in the case of marijuana, incompatible with what a growing majority of voters want. While marijuana may be the illicit drug used most by Americans, and thus the one we are most comfortable with as a culture, marijuana growers and dealers aren’t disproportionately punished when compared to the makers and sellers of other illicit drugs.  All drug offenders are getting a raw deal from our criminal justice system.  It would be a mistake to say, ”Let out the people who sell a drug that I’m comfortable with, and to hell with all the rest.” Federal and state legislators need to address bad policies for all drug types, and then establish a clear route to resentencing for pot dealers    and everybody else.

"Science-Loving Teens From Ghana And D.C. Geek Out Together. It was a meeting of nerds and sharks. The   ”biotech nerds” and ”robotic nerds” were seven high school students from Washington, D. C. The eight teens who call themselves ”sharks” and flew in from Ghana. ”The shark is a big fish so it means you’re big. Knowledgeable,” explains Stephanie Obbo of Ghana, an aspiring medical doctor. Together, the 15 high schoolers formed a team for the first World Smarts STEM Challenge. That’s a science competition run by IREX, a global development nonprofit that strives to promote student enthusiasm for science, tech, engineering and math (aka STEM). Each of the 17 teams had teenagers in the D. C. area partnering with Ghanaians to identify and solve a   problem. NPR’s Goats and Soda followed ”Team McKwiny”  —   a name that blends D. C.’s McKinley Technology High School and Winneba Senior High School in Ghana. They had collaborated since September over the internet. The Americans kicked around the idea of minimizing carbon emissions. The Ghanaians wanted to tackle water pollution. They finally agreed to design and build a water purifier. Both contingents had a personal stake in the project. The McKinley students found high levels of lead in the Anacostia River that flows through Washington, D. C. And the Winneba students in southern Ghana found pesticides, hospital waste, sewage and other pollutants in a nearby lagoon used for fishing and irrigation. And because water shortages cause locals to rely on streams and ponds for clean drinking water, more than 100 cases of cholera swept through a neighboring district just in October 2016. The Ghanaian teenagers proposed using local materials, like leaves from neem trees, to help filter the water. (The medicinal and antibacterial properties of neem leaves and oil have been studied.) The Americans, with no access to neem leaves, suggested substituting cilantro after learning that it removes lead from water  —   a property discovered by undergraduate researchers in 2013. Meeting in person for the first time was a little awkward, since being social mattered at least as much as being scientific. American Miara Bonner, wearing a lab coat and hoop earrings, suggested an icebreaker. ”What’s that?” asked the Ghanaians in unison. A    game revealed similarities and differences. ”I also don’t like the food at my school,” said Cassell Robinson of McKinley. ”We have many tribes and festivals to remember the past and sacrifice animals,” said Winneba junior Stephanie Obbo. Bonner’s jaw dropped. ”I did not know any of that.” She remembers thinking, ”They hunt. They sacrifice. They don’t teach you that in history!” Their purification device consisted of four interconnected plastic buckets. In the first chamber, the water is filtered through gravel and sand. Then moringa seeds and neem leaves (or cilantro) in the sedimentation chamber extract particles before the water is boiled in a different chamber and then stored. Team McKwiny tested their treated water samples and said they were able to remove contaminants from both fresh and salt water, meeting World Health Organization standards for safety. ”It opens up my eyes that there are a lot of things that are useful out in the world that I just haven’t found yet,” said McKinley’s Megan Richardson. The goal of the competition is to encourage that kind of curiosity. Especially because few American students are embracing STEM. ”Only about 16 percent of American high school seniors are proficient in math and interested in a STEM career,” said Rebecca Bell Meszaros, associate vice president for education with IREX. ”This program is combining STEM and 21st century skills like problem solving, innovation and   communication.” She adds that IREX chose to focus the program, made possible by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, in Ghana because the nonprofit has good access to schools with reliable internet. By Saturday’s final event, American and Ghanaian members of Team McKwiny were whispering into each other’s ears and holding hands. But they didn’t get the grand prize. That went to Team ”Big Bang . .. Brains of the World!” The students had filled ice trays with soil, added copper wire that was coiled around   nails and then poured lemon juice on top. Their battery produced enough voltage to light an LED. The team now has a chance to pitch their battery to investors IREX will match up to $10, 000 raised. ”The winning soil battery demystifies energy production and storage at a time when battery storage is evolving faster than ever,” said judge Jim Egenrieder, director of Virginia Tech’s National Capital Region Thinkabit Labs. ”And the water filtration system prototype represents what may become part of every household in the future, as we learn to use and reuse precious water resources.” Team McKwiny came in second and plans to keep going. The Ghanaian students hope to apply for funding from nongovernmental organizations to construct their filter on the outskirts of the Winneba Township. They want to put the first filter near a school where students lack access to clean water and sometimes have no option but to use water shared by livestock. In the end, the students didn’t just learn about science. The Americans got new insights into life in the developing world. ”I didn’t know that there are lagoons that people get their drinking water from  —   the water that they bathe in and wash their clothes in,” said Miara Bonner, who hopes to one day become an endodontic surgeon. ”I don’t like the idea of that. When I heard that, I thought this is the problem we need to focus on.” And the Ghanaians tossed out their stereotypes of Americans. Belinda Dogbe had the preconception that Americans would be ”snobbish, always wanting to be alone, not friendly”  —   a stereotype that came from Hollywood movies. ”I realized we are wrong,” she said. ”They are very friendly, they are open. They love to ask questions.” Sasha Ingber is a multimedia journalist who covers science, culture and foreign affairs for such publications as National Geographic and Smithsonian.

"’She was a demon:’ Trial for murder of 2-year-old Bella Bond begins.  (CNN) The man accused of killing    Bella Bond, the cherubic girl whose unidentified remains were found in a trash bag two years ago near Boston, was obsessed with the occult and thought the young girl was a demon, Suffolk County prosecutors said in opening statements on Tuesday. Michael McCarthy, the   of the girl’s mother Rachelle Bond, has been charged with   murder for allegedly killing Bella, either by suffocating her or punching her in the stomach repeatedly. Her body was stored in a refrigerator and then put in a plastic bag and dumped into the water, authorities said. McCarthy has pleaded not guilty to murder. His defense attorney alleged that Rachelle Bond was the one truly obsessed with demons and that she was ”probably” Bella’s true killer. ”He had nothing to do with her tragic death. Michael did not even know that Bella was dead until the police who arrested him told him,” McCarthy’s defense attorney Jonathan Shapiro said. ”The prosecution’s case rests entirely upon the uncorroborated and unbelievable testimony from Rachelle Bond.” Bond was charged with accessory after the fact for allegedly helping to dispose the child’s body, and she pleaded guilty in February. Both Bond and McCarthy have struggled with heroin addiction, authorities said. Bond will testify in the case as part of a cooperation agreement with prosecutors, and she will be sentenced to probation as part of the agreement. The mystery of ’Baby Doe’ Bella Bond’s case dates to June 2015, when a woman walking her dog discovered the gruesome bag with a young girl’s partially decomposed remains off the shoreline of Deer Island in Boston. A   blanket and polka dot leggings were also found in the bag, located just east of Boston’s Logan International Airport. Authorities launched extensive efforts to identify the girl known as ”Baby Doe,” and an artist’s image of the   girl was shared widely. Tips poured in to investigators as to her identity, but the killing remained a mystery for months. The investigation broke open in September when Bond admitted to a friend that her daughter Bella was dead, and that the girl had not been taken away by the state’s Department of Children and Families as she had previously claimed.  The friend, Michael Sprinsky, looked up the story of ”Baby Doe” and recognized the blanket and leggings as Bella’s. He then came forward to authorities with what Bond said, leading to the arrests. ’She was a demon’ According to prosecutors, Bond said she saw McCarthy strike Bella one night and that the girl’s face turned blue and lifeless.  ”She just died. It was her time. She was a demon,” McCarthy said, according to prosecutors. McCarthy allegedly threatened Bond not to tell anyone, and then the two binged on heroin and other drugs, prosecutors said. The two then allegedly put her body in a bag with weights and dropped the body into the water. Prosecutors said Bond did not report the incident to police because she was afraid of McCarthy. Bond was ”trapped” by his abusive behavior and by her own drug use, prosecutors said. Defense attorney Shapiro said McCarthy was not obsessed with the occult and Satanism, and said that he was a good father who cared for Bella. Instead, Rachelle Bond was the one obsessed with the occult, Shapiro said.  ”At the end of this trial you will realize that Rachelle was projecting her own delusions onto Michael, and that she blamed him for what she in fact did,” Shapiro said. He quoted Bond’s diary entry from the summer of 2015, in which she wondered why so many children who go missing are never found. ”That’s because the leaders of every country get together and torture and rape and kill these innocent children every year just so they can drink their blood and eat their flesh, so that these reptilian demons can have a moment’s sanity,” Bond wrote, according to Shapiro.",-1.0
"Fox News Reporter: Sorry If ’Tongue-In-Cheek’ Chinatown Segment Caused Offense. Jesse Watters says his story was meant to be     —   but his critics say he invoked a string of Asian stereotypes in a segment taped in New York City’s Chinatown district. Instead of lampooning racist bigotry, his critics say, the segment embodied it. Fox anchor Bill O’Reilly included the segment on Monday’s edition of his show, saying that he sent Watters to Chinatown ”to sample political opinion” because China has been repeatedly criticized by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. While Watters did ask some of the people he met in Chinatown about the presidential election, the tone and content of his segment, which interspersed street interviews with clips from The Karate Kid and other films, prompted criticism on social media. In response, Watters said he is a political humorist, tweeting Wednesday, ”My     interviews are meant to be taken as    and I regret if anyone found offense.” But offense was indeed found here are some of the elements that have been singled out by critics: After the piece aired, Watters told O’Reilly, ”They’re such a polite people, they won’t walk away or tell me to get out of here”  —   to which O’Reilly replied, ”They’re patient. They want you to walk away, because they have anything else to do.” ”It was all in good fun,” Watters said. A debate about that last point has raged in comment sections on YouTube, the Fox News Facebook page and on Watters’ tweet about the segment. ”This video was a burning dumpster fire of racist stereotypes and lazy attempts at humor at the expense of Chinese Americans,” one man wrote on YouTube. Others defended the segment, saying that Watters was essentially playing a character as a clueless reporter  —   and that he was skewering stereotypes, rather than playing to them. Perhaps the most telling street interview in the Fox News segment was one in which Watters asked a man with a command of both Chinese and English to teach him a phrase meaning, ”This is my world.” After hearing Watters’ attempt at pronouncing the line, the man said dismissively, ”You’ve got to do it properly otherwise, forget it!”",-0.5
"Another neo-Nazi site, Stormfront, is shut down – TechCrunch. Stormfront, the oldest neo-Nazi forum on the web, has been shut down by its name provider, Network Solutions, and the domain officially put on hold. The news followed the shutdown of DailyStormer, another supremacist site. Stormfront began in 1990s as a dial-up BBS and then morphed into a website and forum in about 1995. It has been registered at Network Solutions since 1995. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Executive Director Kristen Clarke said that her organization took “action against Stormfront.” “Their website is a vehicle used to promote racially-motivated violence and hate,” she wrote. The group told Network Solutions that Stormfront was violating their terms of service. Stormfront was unique in that it was considered the “murder capital of the Internet” by the Southern Poverty Law Center and, as of 2014, over 100 murders were attributed to Stormfront users. The SPL wrote that the site was popular with “wound collectors.” “A typical murderer drawn to the racist forum Stormfront.org is a frustrated, unemployed, white adult male living with his mother or an estranged spouse or girlfriend,” wrote the SPL in 2014. “She is the sole provider in the household. Forensic psychologists call him a ‘wound collector.’ Instead of building his resume, seeking employment or further education, he projects his grievances on society and searches the Internet for an excuse or an explanation unrelated to his behavior or the choices he has made in life.” The group also has a Cloudflare account according to the DNS records. Cloudflare’s CEO has spoken out against hate groups and was instrumental in beginning the attack against DailyStormer. It’s unclear where or when StormFront will return but as of this writing the website is completely inaccessible.",0.0
"George Clooney: Trump and Bannon the Real ’Hollywood Elitists’. Actor George Clooney unloaded on President Donald Trump and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview, calling the pair the real “Hollywood elitists. ”[In a conversation with French news outlet Canal Plus, the      lashed out at those who criticize Hollywood celebrities for speaking out about politics.  “When Meryl [Streep] spoke, everyone on that one side said, ‘Well, that’s elitist Hollywood speaking,” Clooney said, according to the Hill. ” Trump, he added, “collects $120, 000 a year from his Screen Actors Guild pension fund. He is a Hollywood elitist. ” The Money Monster star was referring to Streep’s   acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in January, in which the actress bashed the president for what she called his “disrespect” and his “violence. ” Clooney told Canal Plus that Streep had “every right to speak up. ” The actor also took aim at Bannon, whom he called a “failed film writer and director. ” The White House chief strategist has produced 16 films, including the documentaries The Undefeated and Torchbearer. “He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L. A. riots that he couldn’t get made,” Clooney said. “He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld. He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean that’s the reality. ” Clooney was a heavy contributor to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and hosted a $33, 400   fundraiser for her last year at the Studio City home he shares with wife Amal Clooney. In a letter sent to donors on behalf of the candidate last year, Clooney called Trump a racist who “hates Muslims” and who “thinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again. ” The actor also previously called Trump a “xenophobic fascist. ” While attending the Cannes Film Festival in May, Clooney confidently told reporters that Trump would not win the election. “There’s not going to be a President Donald Trump,” he said. “Fear is not going to be something that drives our country. We’re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We’re not actually afraid of anything. We’re not going to use fear. So that’s not going to be an issue. ” The actor appeared to soften his position on Trump in January, when he told the Associated Press at the premiere of his Syrian relief worker documentary The White Helmets that he hopes the president will “do a decent job. ” But in his interview with Canal Plus this week, Clooney said it was still “hard to imagine” that Trump is president. “We have a demagogue in the White House,” he said. “We need the fourth estate, which is journalists, to hold his feet to the fire. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",1.0

"Europe view: American democracy isn’t as strong as you think.  (CNN) Eight years ago, early in the Obama presidency, I was sitting with a group of conservative students in the cafeteria of a liberal Ivy League college. I was the only   among them. One of the campus liberals approached us to pick a fight: She was agitating for the new Democratic administration to pursue a case for war crimes against former President George W. Bush. My GOP cronies bridled. ”This is America,” one insisted. ”When one side gets into power, they let the other side retire quietly    they don’t stick their predecessors’ heads on spikes. We don’t use the law as a tool to punish political opponents. That’s what makes us different from banana republics in Africa. That’s what makes us the greatest democracy in the world.” Regardless of what you think about George W. Bush    or this characterization of the entire African continent    my friend summed up what many Americans believe about their nation’s strengths. From Thomas Jefferson onward, the rhetoric of the democratic example has been fundamental to the mythology of American exceptionalism. Central to this reverence is the faith Americans have in their Constitution: a document which promises to punish corrupt representatives, constrain executive overreach and protect judicial independence. But beyond America’s borders, even its greatest admirers reserve a dose of skepticism. America’s confidence that its Constitution uniquely protects against abuse of power feels, at best, naïve.  For those of us who split our lives between America and Europe, the series of scandals now emanating from the Trump White House will prove the true test of whether American checks and balances are all they promise. Our European friends are doubtful. No nation is exempt from the risk of an authoritarian coup. The clear feeling in Europe today is that America is, as Sen. Brian Schatz recently tweeted, ”in a   constitutional crisis.”  People are concerned about traveling to the US, even concerned about doing business in a country that no longer seems to uphold the rule of law. No longer is America a shining example, as my college friends would have it, to the tin pot dictatorships of Africa. In nations without local surrogates ready to defend his GOP, you’ll find few people who believe President Donald Trump’s claim that he dismissed FBI Director James Comey in response to Comey’s past criticism of Hillary Clinton. Trump’s letter to Comey references a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, which in turn describes Comey as ”wrong to usurp the authority of the Attorney General on July 5, 2016.” That’s the date, in the middle of the presidential campaign, when Comey issued a damning statement on Clinton, just falling short of recommending prosecution. Though Trump initially called Comey’s decision not to pursue prosecution a ”travesty,” he later praised Comey for his handling of the investigation. It seems much more revealing that Comey’s firing took place a day after he reportedly stepped up his own inquiry into the Trump campaign’s alleged links to Russia. (It is worth noting, too, that Rosenstein, an Obama appointee, does not explicitly call in his memo for Comey’s dismissal    just as Comey himself criticized Hillary, but declined to recommend charges. Precision matters in   legal inquiries.)  None of this makes comfortable watching for America’s allies. Should British Prime Minister Theresa May trust her friend Donald to treat her as professionally as he has treated James Comey? Should she direct her intelligence agencies to share with American colleagues their information on Vladimir Putin’s activities? If there is a scrap of hope to be gleaned from President Trump’s obvious misdirection this week, it is that Trump has veiled his attack on his own FBI director in the language of bipartisan constitutionalism. The attempt to present this sacking as a favor to Democrats    who blame Comey for styming Clinton’s campaign    at least suggests that he knows the directors of major civic infrastructure should command bipartisan support. Or does it? The problem with being European, looking at America, is that we know dictators have always used the language of constitutionalism to camouflage their land grabs. In Turkey, President Erdogan began his reign by appointing senior men of his own party to leading civic positions. His international spokesmen’s rationale? That Turkish public life had for too long been dominated by the army: Only his appointees could provide the civilian oversight necessary to a modern democracy. This proved a particularly appealing fig leaf for American commentators: In August 2011, the headline of a Boston Globe editorial called Erdogan’s reforms  ”Sign of a maturing democracy.” Six years later, and he is widely accepted in America to have established a dictatorship. If there’s a single question on every European’s lips, it is: How long can Trump last? To those of us who’ve heard Americans wax lyrical about the legacy of the Founding Fathers, now is the time when we expect to see the US Constitution’s checks and balances swing into action. We know that Americans are good at getting rid of presidents: In the American TV series that form our stable diet, it happens all the time, from ”Veep” to ”24.” It’s happened in living memory, too. If you can impeach a president simply for lying about sex, surely you can impeach a president who sacks the person investigating him? Now, however, it’s American observers who sound more skeptical. If you’re actually living in America, you know that it’ll be hard to get much of the congressional GOP on board for an impeachment that nothing really constrains the executive branch’s power over civic appointments. It is evident that separation of powers only truly exists in the United States when separate parties control the executive and legislature.  Smug Europeans are congratulating themselves that Americans were always wrong about their exceptional democracy. Those of us with a foot in both continents are not so much smug as heartbroken.",-1.0
"Brooks Koepka holds his nerve in major style to land the US Open title. Major championships are now the domain of golf’s   pretenders. Seven in a row have been claimed by   champions, with the conclusion to the 117th US Open developing into a test of nerve for Brooks Koepka. The    from Florida became the latest player to deliver on earlier and widely recognised promise. Koepka  —   like Jason Day, Danny Willett, Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Jimmy Walker and Sergio García  —   is a bridesmaid no more. Even fresh, testing Wisconsin conditions for day four and the weight of history could not halt Koepka as he brilliantly pieced together a 67. Three birdies in a row from the 14th provided the hammer blow to those in pursuit the eventual margin of victory was four shots, at 16 under par, a   US Open tally. Brian Harman and Hideki Matsuyama shared second place. Koepka’s glory owes plenty to a bold career path. Rather than play through low grade tours in his native United States, he opted to move outside his comfort zone and to Europe. US PGA Tour status was earned as he progressed through the Challenge and European Tours, impressing seasoned observers on the way. Major wins, albeit never certain, appeared highly likely. This may be just the start. Of the players who fell short here perhaps Tommy Fleetwood has the most cause to be upbeat. The Englishman continues a tremendous 2017, with aspirations of success at next month’s Open Championship perfectly realistic. This was, after all, his first time in major contention. Fleetwood finished fourth at 11 under. Rickie Fowler’s challenge stumbled on the back nine while Harman, who had hitherto dropped only two shots in the whole tournament, was to run out of putting form when posting bogeys at the 12th, 13th and the last. Fowler’s 72 meant a share of fifth. Koepka’s triumph had a foundation on the greens. A birdie putt from 41ft at the 8th played a key part in reaching the turn in 33. By the time he took to the penultimate hole his lead was virtually unassailable. The prize was a record $2. 1m. Matsuyama came to grips with this ferocious battle, embarking on a stirring chase from just inside the top 20. The man seeking to become Japan’s first ever major champion posted a 66 for his   total Matsuyama’s tilt at the top comes with the context of starting this tournament with a 74. At that point he was 82nd. Matsuyama will rue one shot. His drive at the tricky 15th was pulled horribly into dense rough, from where he could only chip out sideways. The bogey which ensued proved damaging, though he should have the consolation of a rise to No2 in the world rankings on Monday morning. Matsuyama played the closing three holes in two under par despite being aware that one more time ruling would result in him being penalised a stroke. Justin Thomas encountered the problems associated with backing up a   performance. Thomas entered folklore on Saturday with the 63 which represented the lowest score to par in US Open history. Within five holes of his final round, the    was three over par. This   inevitably left him with too much to do as others on the leaderboard collected early shots. So continues an ominous trend in Thomas’s career when things start to go wrong, he is not particularly adept at stemming the flow. Thomas’s 75 left him tied ninth. Given the list of illustrious names who could not survive past 36 holes here, special credit is due to Scottie Scheffler. The    from Dallas finished as the leading amateur on the highly respectable   aggregate of minus one. As Scheffler continues his career, confidence clearly will not be a problem. “I was trying to compete and see if I could win the golf tournament,” he said. “I think it would be pretty cool winning the US Open as an amateur and that was my goal coming in. ” Lee Westwood’s 76 perhaps impacted on   sentiment but the Englishman made it clear he would be in no hurry to return to Erin Hills. “This wouldn’t be my favourite US Open venue,” he admitted. “I prefer when they play the traditional golf courses. The two new ones they have played recently [Chambers Bay and Erin Hills] aren’t as good as the older style courses like Shinnecock, Winged Foot, Oakmont and Congressional. ” Jordan Spieth instead offered glowing praise towards the United States Golf Association’s management of this major. The 2015 champion signed off with a 69 for a total of one over par before acknowledging inevitable pressure as felt by the USGA on account of US Open controversies of recent times. “I was very, very impressed at the job the USGA did this week,” said Spieth. “I think they did a fantastic job. “Chambers Bay was tough with the greens and then last year had a tough Sunday. I thought that the USGA did a phenomenal job this week of allowing the golf course to be what it is and play the way it’s supposed to play. Not trying to do anything to hold any kind of standard. Instead, create an environment where, if you play well, you can score and, if you don’t, then it can go the other way. “There was no unfairness whatsoever. I thought the USGA did a fantastic job coming back this year and I know that they really wanted to. “It’s tough going to two new venues in three years that they’ve never used before. That’s a difficult thing to do. I hate to say it’s surprising but I thought it was really well done. ” Spieth was vague regarding his plans in advance of the Open Championship, raising the possibility he might spend some of his competitive   time in Ireland or Scotland. When he last won a major, in June of 2015, golf’s biggest events seemed a closed shop for the elite. Times have swiftly changed.",-0.5
"Cretin Hop. I have invented a new drinking game for the upcoming Clinton —  Trump presidential debate. It works like this: You stand in the stairwell of a very tall building. Every time somebody says something stupid or dishonest, you walk up a flight of stairs. At the end, you jump out of the nearest window, and people drink at your wake. There are no winners. That some part of this republic’s   should be dependent upon a ceremonial exchange of words between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald Trump  —   two of the most dishonest, vapid, and empty   things in American public life  —   is enough to induce despair. But millions will watch, and one must wonder what, exactly, it is they hope to get out of it. Millions watch the political conventions, too, which is equally mysterious but may shed some light on the debates. Having been to many of those conventions as a reporter, I am painfully aware of something that may not be obvious to the typical home viewer: These events are very, very carefully designed to avoid the production of actual news. If a real story comes out of your political convention, you have done it wrong. That is why they are so dreadfully boring. It may be that people watch boring political events for the same reason they watch boring car races: There is always the possibility of a fiery crash. In much the same way, the possibility of a brawl enlivens the otherwise unbearably tedious game of ice hockey. But the debates are not debates. They have nothing to do with ideas or substantive policy views. They are spectacle, and spectacle is the thing for which Donald Trump has a great talent. Clinton is good at satisfying convention and expectations, whereas Trump is good at making a ruckus. George Bernard Shaw advised against wrestling with pigs on the grounds that “you both get dirty, and the pig likes it. ” But there is no way for Clinton to avoid wrestling this particular pig: She is too much of a creature of political convention to refuse to participate in these ceremonial debates, and too much of a creature of convention to know what to expect out of them. One can only imagine what is going on in the Trump camp. Trump has made a lot of money and endured four humiliating bankruptcies (so far) and literally has been in the business of rolling the dice. He has won big and lost big, and it surely must be a temptation to him and to those who have bought into his daft messianic cult to borrow from the old Reagan approach and “let Trump be Trump. ” That could mean anything from simply peppering Clinton with humiliating schoolyard taunts to showing up in a fur pimp coat with a stripper on each arm. Trump is capable of almost anything, which is why the usual conservative argument for him  —   Clinton is 100 percent guaranteed evil, but with Trump there’s a chance!  —   always leaves me cold. There’s a chance with Trump, sure: a chance of almost anything. He might put Randy Barnett on the Supreme Court. He might put Judge Judy there, too. In a politics of pure spectacle, the advantage belongs to the creature of pure celebrity. In any case, we really ought to stop pretending that these debates are debates, or that anybody is watching to learn which candidate has the more plausible plan for reducing the deficit or putting the economy back on a path toward more robust growth. (Neither of the candidates has anything like an intelligent program for the budget or the economy, in fact.) Any voter who has an IQ above that of an item on the appetizer menu at an oyster bar knows that neither one of these candidates is much inclined to tell the truth about anything, and that   plans are vaguely defined marketing schemes that rarely if ever have anything to do with what a president does once in office. Philosophers have had a lot of fun with the Epimenides paradox, in which the Cretan philosopher says: “All Cretans are liars. ” Cretans I don’t know. Cretins I do, and what else could you call the people who lie professionally  —   or those who enjoy being professionally lied to as a form of recreation?,",1.0

"Attacker in Nice ’radicalized very quickly’.  (CNN) The man who used a   truck to plow down hundreds of people in Nice this week, killing 84, somehow became rapidly radicalized and hadn’t shown up on any   intelligence radar, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Saturday. The minister said Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, had had no record of making militant statements and was not known to the intelligence services. It seems he became radicalized very quickly,” Cazeneuve said, without offering specifics. ”This is a new type of attack,” Cazeneuve said. ”We are now confronted with individuals that are sensitive to the message of ISIS and are committed to extremely violent actions without necessarily being trained by them.” Earlier Saturday, a statement from ISIS’ media group, Amaq Agency, said that an ISIS ”soldier” carried out the attack in Nice. The statement, which was posted by ISIS supporters, said a security source told the agency ”the person who carried out the   in Nice, France, is one of the Islamic State soldiers and carried out the operation in response to calls to target nationals of the coalition which is fighting the Islamic State.” The wording of the statement    not claiming the attack as an outright act of ISIS, but noting that the attacker was responding to calls to act against the coalition    mirrors ISIS’ language in statements after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, when it claimed gunman Omar Mateen as a ”soldier.”   people died in the June 12 massacre. French prosecutor François Molins said Friday the attack in Nice fits with calls that ”terrorist organizations regularly give out on their videos and elsewhere.” New developments in the investigation, As the investigation continued, French authorities were questioning five people Saturday. Among them was Bouhlel’s   who was taken into custody Friday, the   prosecutor’s office said. The other four are men.  Bouhlel, a resident of Nice, was born in Tunisia but had a permit to live and work in France. While Cazeneuve said no evidence had yet been found to tie Bouhlel to jihadism, a source close to the investigation told CNN that a phone number belonging to Bouhlel cropped up in a counterterrorism investigation into an associate of Omar Diaby, a    Senegalese jihadi who lived in Nice before traveling to Syria. Diaby, who calls himself Omar Omsen, commands a French jihadi battalion in Syria affiliated with Jabhat al Nusra, al Qaeda’s branch in Syria. The source said investigators made the link after   case files after the attack in Nice. Investigators are looking into the nature of the links between Bouhlel and Diaby’s associate, but they cannot rule out that the two were possibly just part of the same social circle. French counterterrorism officials have established that a series of YouTube videos Diaby recorded in Nice in 2012 before he departed for Syria helped motivate a significant number of French extremists to travel to fight in Syria. In May, Diaby revealed in a Skype interview with a French journalist that he had faked his own death in August 2015 to get medical treatment outside Syria.  LIVE: Follow rolling updates from Nice terror attack, Hollande warns of continued strikes, French President François Hollande, addressing his country after its third major terrorist attack in 18 months, described the assault as an ”unspeakable act.” ”We have an enemy who is going to continue to strike all the people, all the countries who have freedom as a fundamental value,” Hollande said. Bouhlel was shot to death by police after he barreled down the crowded Promenade des Anglais for almost a mile, crushing and hitting people who had gathered to watch the Bastille Day fireworks. More than 200 people were injured, and at least 55 of them were in critical condition Friday. Bouhlel was identified by fingerprints after his identification card was found in the truck, authorities said. He was known to police because of allegations of threats, violence and thefts over the past six years, and he was given a suspended   prison sentence this year after being convicted of violence with a weapon, authorities said. Bouhlel’s father, who lives in Tunisia, said his son showed signs of mental health issues    having had multiple nervous breakdowns and volatile behavior, said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.  Despite his criminal record, Bouhlel was not on the radar for any kind of terror threat. The man was ”entirely unknown by the intelligence services, whether nationally or locally,” Molins said.  ”He had never been the subject of any kind of file or indication of radicalization.” ’There are dead everywhere’ As the seaside resort town tried to regain a semblance of normalcy Saturday, harrowing new details emerged about Thursday night’s tragedy. One young victim, Kimberley Torres, described how someone tried to throw her out of the way of the truck, but she was still hit by it.  ”I tried to roll myself into a ball, so the people wouldn’t crush me, but I was still hit in the stomach and leg,” she said. The    who lives in Nice and is studying for an international baccalaureate, is  recovering from her injuries at the Fondation Lenval. Her mother, Edvige Torres, said she would take her daughter to a psychologist when her physical wounds had healed. She said her daughter called her in tears because she had been separated from her best friend, whom Kimberley was later reunited with and who was unharmed. ”The most awful thing for her, amidst all this is . .. she was telling me: ’Mum, there are dead everywhere, severed heads, severed people, there’s blood everywhere, mother, come. ’” Edvige Torres said she immediately left her home near the beachfront to find her daughter, whom she then took straight to a hospital. ”I’ve tried to keep my head until now, but I can’t anymore,” she said. ’Bodies flying in the air’ Another student said he saw the attack from the balcony of his friends’ flat. Andres Farfan, a    from Peru, was celebrating finishing his university degree in Nice when he heard screams coming from the beachfront.  He looked down and saw the truck speeding on the footpath of the road.  ”It was going pretty fast, I guess 60 or 70 kph, and people were screaming and trying to avoid it, and some jumped to the beach side, and it is not small sized, it’s a big jump,” Faran said. Most people on the boulevard struggled to avoid the truck as it approached.  ”At that point I thought that these people wouldn’t make it, because it was really fast and they were all together like a pack,” he said. ”I couldn’t watch it. I closed my eyes, and I went inside the apartment. Some of my friends did the opposite    they went outside, when people started screaming, they went and saw this then they started screaming and crying immediately. I can’t imagine what they have seen.  ”They say they saw bodies flying in the air when the truck hit them.” Farfan braced himself to go out on the balcony to see the aftermath. ”We saw the first scenes of the bodies, the uncovered bodies, the dead. I saw a bunch of six, seven bodies    they were stuck to the floor with blood around them. It was horrible to watch.” Before the attack, Bouhlel began the attack about 10:45 p. m. authorities said. At one point, he fired a gun several times at three police officers close to a hotel, the prosecutor said. The truck he used was rented on Monday and was supposed to have been returned Wednesday, Molins said, without specifying  who rented it. Surveillance video shows that about two hours before the attack Thursday, Bouhlel rode a bicycle to pick up the truck east of the city, the prosecutor said. After Bouhlel was shot, police found a handgun and some ammunition in the truck’s cab, as well as a replica handgun, two replica assault rifles, a cell phone and various documents, Molins said. In the trailer was the bicycle and some empty pallets. Hollande declared a national mourning period from Saturday to Monday. France was just preparing to lift its state of emergency, which was put into place in the wake of the November terror attacks in Paris that killed 130 people, the deadliest attack in France’s history.   Nice is just the latest city to be hit by a terror attack. Istanbul, Orlando, Baghdad, Brussels and Dhaka in Bangladesh are among other targets hit in recent months.  ’Big step back’ Cruickshank said ”no country in the Western world is threatened more by jihadis and terrorism than France.” ”This is a big step back here. They are absolutely exhausted after a year and a half of intense efforts to try and protect this country,” Cruickshank said. ”The painful reality here is that if it wasn’t going to be this promenade, it would have been any other promenade.” France had put intense security in place for Euro 2016, the international soccer tournament that just ended. No major attacks occurred during the event. ",-1.0
"How I’m making sure I don't raise a cyberbully | TheHill. My niece loves Instagram, except for the occasional rude comments. Last month, Instagram was the latest social media platform to try and address the challenge of cyberbullying with a customizable comments filter based on objectionable words or phrases and with this month being National Bullying Prevention month — cyberbullying continues to stay in the limelight. Online harassment is a big problem for social networks, so bad that social networks like Facebook and Twitter have teams dedicated to fighting the uphill battle of proactively stopping online abuse. It is also a big problem for parents. The internet makes it easy to be cruel and a bully, and I don’t want my kids or niece to be one of the 35 percent of youth who say that they have bullied people on social media. Bullying can happen anywhere, at any age, but nowadays, with so much information being shared, it seems like the topic of bullying comes up a lot more than it did when I was a kid. Do you ever find yourself comparing your own childhood to your children’s experience? I think about how I’m raising my daughters compared to how my parents raised me all the time. Does today’s technology make parenting harder? It certainly makes it different, with issues that none of us experienced. Online interaction is a big part of our children’s lives, often spread across multiple communities. Unfortunately, social media can be fickle and shallow, and can lead to taunts and other cruelty that make up cyberbullying. Since people at church found out what I do for a living, I’ve become the de-facto person to ask about security.  Luckily, I love what I do, so I don’t mind.  Just recently I had a lengthy discussion about cyberbullying with the kids of some fellow churchgoers, who are around 12 and 13 years old. They were discussing the possibility that one of the kids had been cyberbullied. As we were talking we realized she had indeed experienced bullying, but she worried in her efforts to defend herself that perhaps she had bullied right back.  It can indeed be a circular discussion. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell who “started it,” but what matters is that parents need to set boundaries and communicate them.   While my oldest isn’t quite ready for her first phone, it’s only a matter of time.  My concern is that she hasn’t fully developed an understanding of how things can come across differently in online communication versus in person or even on the phone.  Now to be fair, I have co-workers who could use a reminder of that as well.  While I doubt my daughters will sound like one of those kids screaming in my ear when playing games online, I definitely want to make sure they know how to get across what they mean to when communicating online. Children are picking up and dropping social media platforms faster than most of us can track, and on these platforms they are interacting both with their peers and with larger communities. Most parents say they are following their children on social media, but often only on the platforms the parents know or and participate in, like Facebook. With my kids, I made it clear from day one that the phone, tablet, and computer belong to me, not to them. My kids know that as a parent, part of my job is to keep an eye on what they are doing and I take an active role in doing so.  Watching how they interact with each other online is possibly more important than in real life, because online there are often no adults to supervise and intervene when needed. And because children haven’t yet developed the intricacies of conflict resolution, things can spin out of control too quickly for them to appropriately handle. Before we even started with devices and online activities, my wife and I discussed some key rules with our kids. Here are a few of our rules that may work for you, too: We get to review anything and everything on the device, at our discretion. Zero tolerance for cruelty towards others, with the consequence of immediate loss of device or account. If you are angry or upset, take a break before posting and come talk to us.  Giving them a way to vent and work out how they feel in person can help develop healthy coping mechanisms. We will listen to any and all concerns, questions, or comments you have, and respond thoughtfully without overreacting. I’m big on helping my kids learn lessons themselves instead of just preaching and setting rules that they can easily disconnect from. If I witness one of my kids making inappropriate comments, I ask them what their intent was. I find that in general, they were trying to be funny or sarcastic, but the tone of what they typed did not match what they meant. However, if the comments could be perceived as cutting, or the jokes too cruel, it is important not to laugh these off. Whether they are coming from your child, or directed to them, these typed words, usually visible to the larger community, can set off a chain reaction that will overwhelm even the strongest, most self-confident individual.

"Koch brothers want legislative fix for DACA. The Koch brothers plan to mobilize their conservative political network in order to push Congress to protect the young undocumented immigrants left at risk by the Trump administration's decision to rescind DACA, per The Daily Beast. Their influence: Many GOP members of Congress were elected with Koch money and support, so this decision grants them cover to support some form of legislation that would allow DREAMers to stay in the United States — even as more hawkish conservatives push for stricter immigration laws. Why it matters: It underscores that the DACA debacle — and immigration reform as a whole — is the rare issue that can transcend partisan lines in Washington.",0.0
"Samsung posts another record profit thanks to its chips business – TechCrunch. Samsung posted another record quarter, and it again has its components business to thank for more stellar results. The Korea tech giant shrugged off scandals, which include a jail sentence for its de facto leader and last year’s Note 7 saga, to record a 14.53 trillion won ($12.92 billion) profit for the recent Q3 2017 period. Revenue came in at 62.05 trillion won ($55.18 billion), up 30 percent year-on-year and a record for a third quarter, in no small part due to Samsung’s components business, which supplies chips for a range of consumer electronics including smartphones from other firms. Samsung sells more phones each year than any other company on the planet, but its semiconductor business has traditionally been its best performer and that was once the case in Q3. Overall revenue from the unit was up 51 percent to reach 19.9 trillion won ($17.7 billion), with its profit up close to three-fold to reach 9.96 trillion won, $8.86 billion. The Samsung mobile business got an increase in overall sales and revenue year-on-year, mainly because of the disastrous Note 7 recall, but it was down on the previous quarter’s metrics. The company put that down to customers favoring mid- and low-end devices with smaller margins. Looking forward, it said it intends to increase the focus on higher-end devices as we enter the holiday season when demand increases, but “intensifying competition” — i.e. the iPhone X launch — and the rising cost of materials stand out as key challenges. The company said it expects its financial performance to continue to grow in 2018 “primarily from the component businesses, as conditions in the memory market are likely to remain favorable and the company expects increased sales of flexible OLED panels.” Samsung also announced three new leaders. The company uses a co-CEO structure that sees the heads of its three core divisions — consumer electronics, IT and mobile communications and device solutions — lead the business and that’s where the new hires, who are all Samsung veterans who have been promoted, will sit.",0.0
"Former FBI Agent on Reopened Criminal Investigation: ’Agency Would be Remiss in not Moving Forward’ - Breitbart. The FBI routinely reopens criminal investigation when it discovers significant new evidence, says Nancy Savage, a former FBI agent who is now executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI. [“That’s pretty much SOP  —   I’ve done it myself many a time  —   if you develop new information,” she told Breitbart News from her office in Dumfries, Va. “There’s no double jeopardy issue for someone who hasn’t been charged,” said Savage, who retired from the FBI after 35 years in the agency.  If you develop further evidence of a crime as such, and it is relevant to the charges, you have to open the case so you can start investigating again, and that’s obviously what’s happened   …     it would be a requirement to do so   …     [and] if this other information is presented to you, the agency would be remiss in not moving forward, In a letter to Congress on Friday, FBI director James Comey said the FBI has learned about the existence of more emails linked to the FBI’s investigation of the Hillary Clinton’s   email network. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed by on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,” Comey said. Media reports on Friday say the investigation has been reopened following the discovering of incriminating emails on phones used by her top aide, Huma Abedin and by Abedin’s husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner. New evidence has to be related to the prior investigation, Savage said. The evidence: would have to be substantive enough that it would either relate to the charges from before, or another charge   …     [and] of a nature that is different  —   and of some weight  —   than had been in the investigative files or it would be determined ‘Oh, we’ve seen that information before.’ Still, this set of investigations is closely linked to a presidential candidate, Savage said, so “it is an unusual situation. ”  ",1.0
"Markets just got a hard lesson in humility, Jim Grant says. It's time for financial markets across the globe to eat a big slice of humble pie, Jim Grant said Friday after the shocking result from the United Kingdom referendum on European Union membership. ""It's a great day for humility,"" Grant, the founder and editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box. "" Financial markets across the globe tumbled after the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the EU, a decision markets were not expecting. Ahead of the vote, several polls and bookmakers showed support leaning toward the remain camp. On Friday, U.S. stock futures implied a lower open of more 2.5 percent, while major European indexes shed more than 4 to 8 percent. ""I've thought for some time that markets were anesthetized by central banks, and they've lost a little bit of their capacity to look into the future,"" Grant said. ""What was so striking about the events of the past week is the fact that markets were just flat wrong."" ""Markets, proverbially, were able to see through things that individuals were not and markets were absolutely wrong on this,"" he said.",0.0
"Setting the Body’s ‘Serial Killers’ Loose on Cancer - The New York Times. BETHESDA, Md.  —   The young surgeon was mystified. A   tumor had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet here he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation. The surgeon, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, examined the man’s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors  —   but he could find no trace of cancer. It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient’s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man’s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest. “Something began to burn in me,” he would write later, “something that has never gone out. ” Half a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream  —   turbocharging the body’s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his   patient’s. Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense     pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year. The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and   version of their own immune system, one that “works better than nature made it,” as Dr. June puts it. The patient’s   the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient’s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient’s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins. This is an unusual pharmaceutical  —   a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells “serial killers. ” A single one can destroy up to 100, 000 cancer cells. The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before. “I call it a   molecule,” said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. This radical,   therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those    drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses. Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling. Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market. Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks. “It was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,” Dr. Rosenberg recalled. The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father’s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust. “I saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,” he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard. From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O’Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research. “I loved the night,” Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, “The Transformed Cell,” published in 1992. “I remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise. ” He added: “To be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world. ” When Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients   harvested from pigs. That failed. He then began giving patients   or   a protein made by the body that spurs   to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in  . The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care. From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp “death imminent. ” Ms. Taylor is still alive her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and   onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head. But  ’s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer. Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the   that had already penetrated them,     lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of  . He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack. The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was   and its application to other cancers unclear. There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda. The Navy was not Carl June’s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in   transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest. Dr. June turned to working with   at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the  . He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply   in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the   working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients’   to kill H. I. V. the virus that causes AIDS. But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple’s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June’s research turned personal. Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001. “A lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,” said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June’s work. Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer. “Things that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,” he said. In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge   to fight cancer. “At the time it sounded very pipe dream,” said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain’s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, “believed in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly. ” After earning his Ph. D. Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse  . He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues  —   including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivière  —   showed that genetically engineered   could eradicate certain cancers in mice. How is this done? To fight cancer,   have to recognize cancerous cells. Each   in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface.   patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the   destroys the cell displaying it. But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body’s own cells, not outsiders.   do not always recognize them as something to kill. So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the   one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells. The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body. But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the   to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient’s  . Since this concoction is part antibody and part   it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR   therapy, or  . Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute. Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work. Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana’s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said. But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring   drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient. Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a    woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her    Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. “Without that,” Dr. June said of the charities, “we would not have had a clinical trial. ” As the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment  —   testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce   results. Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.) But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission. One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa. left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running  . “It was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,” said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later. Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered   were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig’s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating. When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed. Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R. V. “We’re trying to make up for lost time,” he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first  . As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: “It’s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later. ” The 2011 publication of Dr. June’s results transformed the field. Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt. While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy. The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children’s Hospital. Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over  —   credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize. While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three. The spotlight further shifted to Dr. June because of his success with Emily Whitehead, a little girl whose miraculous recovery in 2012 made her the poster child for cell therapy. When Mr. Parker, the internet entrepreneur, announced in April that he would spend $250 million to start a new cancer immunotherapy institute, Emily, now 11, appeared on stage at the launch extravaganza with Lady Gaga. Dr. June’s 2011 publications did not cite Dr. Rosenberg’s paper from the previous year, prompting Dr. Rosenberg to write a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. June’s publications also did not acknowledge that the genetic construct he had used was the one he had obtained from Dr. Campana of St. Jude. St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude. The suit was settled last year, with Novartis agreeing to pay $12. 25 million plus possible future payments and royalties. Within days, Dr. June sent a correction and letter of regret to The New England Journal of Medicine, acknowledging that the CAR used in his groundbreaking 2011 study, and in treating Emily Whitehead, was “designed, developed and provided” by St. Jude. Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa. now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself. Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of  ’s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a   transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg’s team. The battle between Mr. Coughlin’s genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and   sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned  —   at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife’s name. But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. “If I had gotten this thing five years ago,” he said of his disease, “I’d be dead. ” Yet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some   lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80, 000 of the 1. 7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs. “The solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,” Dr. Rosenberg said. Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive  —   probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge. Producing the   cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells. And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing   to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations. Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug. Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working. “Every morning my wife would ask me how I’m feeling,” said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del. who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O. K. they were disappointed. Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse. In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge. Karen Shollenberger, a student at Drexel University with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thought she was in the clear after being in remission for nine months after a   treatment. But in September, as the school year was beginning, the cancer returned. “My high hopes for the rest of the term were crushed,” Ms. Shollenberger wrote on her blog in October. She entered a new trial testing a new CAR therapy directed at another protein on  . Again the cancer went into remission, and she returned to school. But fear lurked in her: What if the new therapy also stopped working? That indeed happened recently. Her best hope now is a   transplant. “Each relapse is increasingly terrifying as the options continue to shrink,” said Ms. Shollenberger, 22. But, she said, the cell therapies have given her nearly two good years. The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer. The key is to find protein targets that the engineered   can latch on to to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumor cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects. “  are very powerful,” said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. “In the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you. ” A protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg’s team infused killer   aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later. The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult. One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach. There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients’ immune cells can be engineered to make what are called   receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells. Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma. It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person’s tumor at which to aim the claw. “Think of how dauntingly personalized this is,” Dr. Rosenberg said. “We are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumor. ” He said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients. Many other improvements are on the runway. Dr. Sadelain and Juno are working on “armored CARs” that not only bind to the target but produce   chemicals. Cellectis, a French company, has treated two babies with an    CAR treatment that does not require each patient’s cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient. “We’re in the Model T version of the CAR now,” said Dr. Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. “What’s coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs. ” In February, the   Center for Advanced Cellular Therapeutics opened on the ninth floor of a Penn medical building, paid for mainly by $20 million from Novartis. It has gleaming new laboratory space, clean rooms with the capacity to manufacture therapy for 400 patients a year, and a great view of downtown Philadelphia. On the wall are photographs of patients with success stories, like Doug Olson running a   and, of course, Emily Whitehead. Dr. June, who remarried and had two more children, now jets off regularly to attend conferences and give talks. A world map hanging outside his office is titled “Where in the World Is Carl June?” It has pins stuck in every location he has been, and a picture of him on a bicycle pinned to his location at the moment. In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200, 000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California. Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor. Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute’s CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company. “He sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, ‘Arie, why don’t you ask me what I want to do?’ “He said: ‘Every day that I go to work, I’m as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day. ’” But not before he conquers cancer. “I want to end this holocaust,” Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. “I think I’m finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers. ”",-1.0
"Bogotá Journal, Part II. Editor’s Note: Jay Nordlinger traveled to Bogotá, the Colombian capital, to report on recent political events there. In a lightish supplement, he is jotting this journal. For Part I, go here. The journal concludes today. Where was I, when we knocked off? At the mall, I think  —   the mall with the Christmas decorations outside it (already). There is also a Juan Valdez Café, as there are all over this city. He gets around, Juan Valdez does. And don’t ever underestimate the power of Cinnabon. There is one here, in the mall. Throughout the city, there are Esso stations. I haven’t seen one back home in a long time. And I always think of Mussolini: who hung there, in Milan, at the end of the war   …     I see a  . No, hang on, it’s not: It’s a Hotel Dann Carlton. Yet the script seems the same as the  . Hmmm   …     It’s easy, I think, to romanticize street food. I remember the supplì I had as a student, on the streets of Rome. In my memory, they were ambrosial, or whatever the right word is. Here in Bogotá, I have some mediocre street food. And some heavenly. It simply depends, as indoors, right? Speaking of restaurants: There is a chain here called “Buffalo Wings. ” I wonder whether the name gives these restaurants a foreign cachet. Speaking of things foreign: I have an immensely learned friend in the city who studied in America, France, England, and elsewhere. He has a number of languages  —   including German, because he attended a   school here as a boy. A desirable start. Continuing with things foreign: The French embassy in the Colombian capital? Oogly. Not just ugly but oogly, as an old southern friend of mine would say. It is a bronze chain box, basically. France deserves better. But hang on: When I look at it again, it is   modern   …     There is an outfit called “Education First. ” That’s its name, in English. I mean, I have not translated: The outfit is called “Education First. ” Also catching my eye is a little monument announcing the “Avenida Estado de Israel. ” State of Israel Avenue. There must be a story behind that. There are graffiti on the monument, but nothing bad. Nothing Nazi. Speaking of Jews: I see at least two bookstores called Lerner, which is utterly natural. Indeed, it is warmingly stereotypical. On a hill is a lovely old seminary, the Seminario Conciliar de Bogotá. Maybe all lovely old seminaries should be on hills, as in “city on a”? I have an observation more  : Bogatanas tend to dress chicly. I see a lot of tight pants with boots, for example. Does Bogotá have some wealth? Well, let me put it this way: There is a Maserati dealership. My cabbie does not have a Maserati. We are going down a steep hill, and the road at the end happens to be blocked. So we need to back out of the street. The street is an ancient one, stony. The car cannot handle the backward, steeply uphill journey. So, I get out and push. Have I ever before gotten out of a cab and pushed? I think so, yes: in the snow and ice. This cabbie  —   a wonderful gent  —   talks about the political situation in his country. His assessment includes a denunciation of Álvaro Uribe, the  . Little does he know that he is taking me to see this   Uribe   …     In La Candelaria, the old, historic district, there is a stately school, which I am told is the oldest in the city: the Colegio Salesiano de León XIII, or the Leo XIII Salesian College. (Bear in mind the old sense of “college. ”) This morning, I see 20 or 30 kids, all lined up. They are wearing burgundy sweaters. Girls have plaid skirts and boys blue pants. They are overseen by an elderly, sturdy nun. It is practically out of Central Casting. You know how graffiti are supposed to be wild and free? Spontaneous and individualistic? I have long wondered: Why is it that graffiti, all over the world, look the same? There is a graffiti style. Graffiti art is essentially one thing, I think. Don’t these vandals want to be more imaginative? A young woman says to me, “Buenos días,” and then, immediately, “Buenas tardes. ” Because now is the switching time. How do you know what the switching time is? I wondered about “Buon giorno” and “Buona sera” way back, when I was in Italy. There is no    rule about this. Some Italians say “Buona sera” “dopo il pranzo”  —   after the midday meal, the main meal. Other Italians say “Buon pomeriggio”  —   “Good afternoon”  —   before getting to “Buona sera” (“Good evening”). In large measure, I’m sure, you go by feel   …     You want some more language? This is political. In most parts of the world, “liberal” means   …     well, Reaganite, Thatcherite. Howardite. (I’m thinking Australia.) In America it means McGovernite. Or is that term too antique by now? I am amazed to find out  —   from a reliable source  —   that “liberal,” here in Colombia, means what it does in the U. S.: leftist, or at least pink. Which is a shame. But the rescue of the word “liberal” is an old story, and I have written about it so much, my fingers balk at it now   …     I spot a big monument. To whom, I don’t know. When in doubt, guess Simón Bolívar. Around the monument are little plastic trees. Little plastic trees with autumn leaves. Really? In a city bursting with flora? Okay then   …     I drink pop from a bottle  —   a real glass bottle. It has been ages since I did that. Plastic has long been king. The glass feels almost alien in my hand. Feels good, too. Bogotá rests at a high altitude, and I think of a song lyric: “up where the air is rare. ” I later realize  —   courtesy Google  —   that the phrase is “up where the air is clear. ” I somehow like “rare,” though   …     You recall the “squeegee men,” from the bad old days of New York. While you were waiting at a stoplight, in your car, these men would splash dirty water on your windshield. If you paid them, they would clean it off. In this city, a woman places boxes of candy or something between rearview mirrors and the bodies of cars. If you don’t buy “your” box, she plucks it off, before the light turns green. That is more civilized, I think. The cabbie is listening to the radio. He likes this singer, but he can’t remember his name. “He was married to ” he tells me. So I Google: and find that Jennifer Lopez has three  . I call out one of the names. “No, not him,” says the cabbie. I call out another one. “That’s it,” he says. Marc Anthony (né Marco Antonio Muñiz). Earlier, I mentioned an “immensely learned friend,” here in Bogotá. He teaches me something I never knew  —   about a U. S. president. In the 1820s, William Henry Harrison served here, as Minister Plenipotentiary to Gran Colombia. He met Bolívar, and urged him to adopt   democracy. I wonder whether Harrison enjoyed it here. Bet he did. I have. Thanks for joining me, ladies and gentlemen. ",1.0
"Tim Kaine Plans Campaign Speech Entirely En Español - Breitbart. Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine plans to deliver a campaign speech entirely in Spanish in Arizona, in an effort to impress Latinos in the important swing state. [“In Phoenix, Kaine will deliver remarks entirely in Spanish  —   a first for an organized campaign rally during a US presidential campaign  —   about the high stakes of this election and the choice voters face,” the Clinton campaign revealed in a statement.  Clinton’s campaign boasted that the Latino community was making Arizona competitive for the first time since 1996, thanks to what it called “offensive and dangerously divisive rhetoric” by Donald Trump and Clinton’s “inclusive” political message. Kaine repeatedly refers to his missionary work in Honduras, where he learned to speak Spanish fluently. “Spanish was the language of our country before English,” Kaine said in the interview with José   on Telemundo. “It’s important to remember that, and celebrate it. ” In 2013, Kaine made history by delivering a 13 minute speech entirely in Spanish in support of the Gang of Eight amnesty bill being considered by the Senate. That was the first time a U. S. Senator delivered a speech on the Senate floor entirely in Spanish. ",1.0
"A Victory Lap in Blood. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Congratulations, Donald Trump. Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don’t want congrats, I want toughness  vigilance. We must be smart! To be clear, congratulations are not in order because you’re tough and vigilant. You are late to that party: President George W. Bush declared war on terrorism in 2002 and handed it over to President Barack Obama, who tweaked the rhetoric and strategy but nonetheless kept up the fight. Together, the Bush and Obama regimes have killed tens of thousands of Islamic extremists, along with countless innocents. You were not right on radical Islamic terrorism. But you are doing right by radical Islamic terrorism. You are giving legitimacy to ISIS’s nefarious interpretation of a peaceful religion. You are helping ISIS recruit terrorists. You are dividing Americans at a time when all Americans most need to be united. So congratulations. What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough,  A lot to unpack in that tweet: Now, apparently, you’re for the ban again —  despite the fact that Mateen was a U. S.  son of Afghan immigrants. Or does “the ban” now extend to  ? Will ethnic cleansing be a hallmark of your presidency? Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace! Obama won’t mention the phrase because he thinks doing so would embolden ISIS and alienate the 3. 3 million Muslims in America, a patriotic and largely assimilated community that is a bulwark against domestic terrorism. Obama shouldn’t resign, but you should consider a different line of work after suggesting today that the president might somehow be involved in the Orlando massacre. A baseless, disgraceful lie. You could argue that it’s important to give the enemy a name. OK, let’s do that: Islamic extremism. Islamic extremism. Islamic extremism.  Radical Islam. Radical Islam. Radical Islam. Wait for it  …     No, ISIS didn’t crumble. You’re wrong, Donald Trump. Words don’t win wars. But your words do undermine the   . Your words do exploit fears, stir prejudices, and divide Americans. Your words might even win you the election. Which is the point, right? In March, you said talk about terrorist attacks “is probably why I’m number one in the polls. ”   innocent people dead and you took a victory lap in their blood. Congratulations.",-0.5

"Social investment platform eToro acquires smart contract startup Firmo – TechCrunch. Social investing and trading platform eToro announced that it has acquired Danish smart contract infrastructure provider Firmo for an undisclosed purchase price. Firmo’s platform enables exchanges to execute smart financial contracts across various assets, including crypto derivatives, and across all major blockchains. Firmo founder and CEO Dr. Omri Ross described the company’s mission as “…enabl[ing] our users to trade any asset globally with instant settlement by tokenizing assets and executing all essential trade processes on the blockchain.” Firmo’s only disclosed investment, according to data from Pitchbook, came in the form of a modest pre-seed round from the Copenhagen Fintech Lab accelerator. Firmo’s mission aligns well with that of eToro — which is equal parts trading platform, social network and educational resource for beginner investors — with the company having long communicated hopes of making the capital markets more open, transparent and accessible to all users and across all assets. By gobbling up Firmo, eToro will be able to accelerate its development of offerings for tokenized assets. The acquisition represents the latest step in eToro’s broader growth plan, which has ramped up as of late. Earlier in March, the company launched a crypto-only version of its platform in the US, as well as a multi-signature digital wallet where users can store, send and receive cryptocurrencies. The Firmo deal and eToro’s other expansion activities fit squarely into the company’s belief in the tokenization of assets and the immense, sector-defining opportunity that it creates. Etoro believes that asset tokenization and the movement of financial services onto the blockchain are all but inevitable and the company has employed the long-tailed strategy of investing heavily in related blockchain and crypto technologies despite the ongoing crypto winter. “Blockchain and the tokenization of assets will play a major role in the future of finance,” said eToro co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia. “We believe that in time all investible assets will be tokenized and that we will see the greatest transfer of wealth ever onto the blockchain.” Assia expressed a similar sentiment in a recent conversation with TechCrunch, stating “We think [the tokenization of assets] is a bigger opportunity than the internet…” After the acquisition, Firmo will operate as an internal R&D arm within eToro focused on developing blockchain-oriented trade execution and the infrastructure behind the digital representation of tokenized assets. “The Firmo team has done ground-breaking work in developing practical applications for blockchain technology which will facilitate friction-less global trading,” said Assia. “The adoption of smart contracts on the blockchain increases trust and transparency in financial services. We are incredibly proud and excited that [Firmo] will be joining the eToro family. We believe that together we have a very bright future and look forward to pursuing our shared goal to become the first truly global service provider allowing people to trade, invest and save.”",0.0

" Charities Raise Millions At Trump’s Mar-A-Lago Club — But For A Steep Fee.  Lavish galas and balls are a hallmark of the social scene in Palm Beach, Florida  —   and often all put on to raise money for   charities. One of the largest and most popular venues for these events is Donald Trump’s    club, where money is raised each year for charities like the American Heart Association. Trump has pointed to the money raised at the club as evidence of his own philanthropy, telling CNBC in 2011, “I believe there is more money in that club for charity than any other place in Florida. I mean, the place has been amazing, the kind of money we raise on a weekly basis, and I just believe that you have to give back and if you don’t give back, you’re not being honest with yourself. ” As the owner of    Trump brings in millions of dollars in revenue for his company by hosting these major charity events each year. Though a    employee said she could not share pricing information with a   a BuzzFeed News review of charity tax records and local fundraising permits shows that the price tag to hold events there usually ranges between $200, 000 and $350, 000, depending on factors like the number of attendees. Smaller events, like luncheons and receptions, tend to run outside groups under $100, 000. The fees for services provided by     —   the venue, food, and drinks  —   can comprise more than half the total price for the major events. While Trump has often bragged about the money he personally donates, investigations by BuzzFeed News and the Washington Post have raised questions about his claims of charitable giving. A Washington Post investigation was only able find $10, 000 in personal charity donations from Trump over the last seven years. Most donations from Trump to charity are through his namesake Trump Foundation, to which he hasn’t donated since 2008.    is appealing for charities looking to host big events in part due to its size. Other than The Breakers, a resort, it is the only venue in town capable of holding   guests, according to a spokesperson for the   Cancer Institute, which has held its annual gala at    every year since 2011. One of the charities most loyal to Trump’s club, the Palm Beach Police Foundation, which supports the local police department, has spent an average of $261, 777 each year on its annual ball, held at Trump’s club every year since the charity was founded in 2006. Where the organization’s tax records show fees for the price of the facility, those range from $125, 000 in 2007 to $235, 362 in 2012 to $276, 463 in 2013. Asked whether he agrees with the Republican nominee’s suggestion that hosting charity events at    is part of how he gives back, John Scarpa, the foundation’s president, said in an interview with BuzzFeed News that the resort has granted his organizations what he estimates is a 10 to 12% discount on food. He says the club also provides some free amenities, such as heaters for the   poolside cocktails (the Policeman’s Ball is in January). Trump, Scarpa said, donates a private helicopter trip to his Doral Golf Course to be sold at the event’s auction, an item that he called a “really good   for us. ” During at least three years, the Palm Beach Police Foundation has lost money at    losing more than $278, 000 between its dinners in 2006, 2007, and 2010. Roger Craver, a charity expert who spoke with BuzzFeed News, said that losing money as a new charity was not uncommon. Scarpa, who said he considered the events a success, did not respond to a   request for comment on the lost money. Trump is frequently involved with events hosted at his club, donating his time and celebrity by acting as event chairman or serving as a charity’s sponsoring member (charity events must have a member sponsor them in order to be held at the private club). He has also sometimes pledged money, like when he pledged $50, 000 during a live auction at one 2012 American Heart Association event. Trump’s foundation tax record from that year shows a donation to the American Heart Association of $65, 000. Even after he stopped putting his own money into his charitable organization, Trump has made large donations from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to groups which host events at   . The   Cancer Institute has received $386, 000 from Trump’s foundation since 2008, when it first held its gala at    including donations in 2009 and 2010, when it moved to The Breakers, before returning the following year. The Trump foundation has also been particularly generous to the Palm Beach Police Foundation, with records showing total contributions of $250, 000. Trump’s foundation has also donated $203, 500 over the years to the American Cancer Society, which has held its annual ball at    every year since 2007. While the charity’s 990s don’t show the price of that event, a 2008 article in the Sun Sentinel reported that they value around $300, 000, a number that is approximately in line with price estimates on town fundraising permits from other years. In one year, Trump served as the ball’s honorary chairman. A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign did not return repeated requests for comment on this story. Though some charities contacted by BuzzFeed News would not provide detailed statements on their events at    or Trump’s presence at them, Scarpa of the Palm Beach Police Foundation said that when Trump and his wife Melania attend the Policeman’s Ball, it generates excitement. “A lot of people love to have their picture taken with him,” Scarpa said. He added, though, that he doesn’t think Trump’s presence has much of an impact on attendance. For at least one of Palm Beach’s big charity events, it seems that the downsides of Trump’s presence came to outweigh the benefits. In 2013, the Red Cross moved its annual ball to a competing venue, The Breakers. Asked why they moved the event, that year’s chairwoman Mary Ourisman, a former ambassador to Barbados and Republican fundraiser, told The Washington Post, “It had really become more about Donald Trump than about the Red Cross. ”  ",-1.0

"Is this DJI’s next Mavic drone? – TechCrunch. Here’s what we know for sure: DJI’s got a big event coming up. It was originally scheduled for July 18, but was ultimately pushed back so the company “can deliver according to [its] standard of innovation.” The timing certainly seems right for a followup to 2016’s Mavic Pro, and the “bigger picture” event artwork appears to confirm a focus on imaging. This next part gets a bit more speculative, however. DroneDJ has published an image a (relatively) large folding drone bearing the name “Mavic 2.” The device also sports what looks to be a swappable camera gimbal, meaning users could potentially switch out the on-board model with different version. That would be a welcome change for professional photographers searching for a portable solution they can shove in their camera bag along with the rest of their gear. The addition of wide-angle option would also be in keeping with that whole “bigger picture” bit. CNET notes in a post that 360-degree obstacle avoidance is a possibility here, as well. That would help the new Mavic compete with the (admittedly pricey) R1 from Playground Global-backed startup Skydio that captured the drone community’s hearts. DJI is, of course, still far and away the market leader for consumer drones, and its Mavic line has gone a long way toward helping mainstream the product for consumers. But increased competition is no doubt keeping the company on its toes of late. Leaks certainly wouldn’t be anything new for DJI, as the last several devices have surfaced online in some form prior to release. The company unsurprisingly declined our request for comment, however.",0.0
"In Peru, Obama predicts rising tensions on trade. Lima, Peru (CNN) President Barack Obama predicted in Peru Saturday that a Trump presidency won’t result in ”major changes in policy” for the   America relationship, though he conceded that tensions are likely to rise on the subject of trade. But, Obama told the audience at the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, once the incoming administration looks at how trade relationships are working, ”they’ll determine that it’s actually good for both the United States and our trading partners,” though he said ”modifications” are possible. Obama also gave the same advice to Latin America that he gave to European leaders earlier this week, cautioning the audience to not ”assume the worst” on what a Trump presidency could mean for policies but to ”wait until the administration is in place.”  Obama was addressing a town hall audience and discussed the importance of democracy in the wake of the election, saying that democracy means ”the outcomes of elections don’t always turn out the way you would have hoped.” ”Democracy is more than just elections,” Obama told the YLAI, a program that supports young entrepreneurs created by Obama in 2015.  ”Democracy can be frustrating because democracy means that you don’t always get 100 percent of what you want. Democracy means that sometimes you have to compromise. And it means that you know, the outcomes of elections don’t always turn out the way you would have hoped,” Obama said.  Peru is the final stop on the President’s last trip abroad while in office. Earlier this week, Obama visited Athens and Berlin, where he was plagued with questions of what a Trump presidency means for the United States alliances abroad.  Obama also announced a series of investments and new programs in support of  YLAI Saturday, including new grants and increasing access to mentorship from the private sector. ",-1.0
"Miami schools prepare for ’potential influx’ after Castro’s death.  (CNN) While leaders in Cuba make preparations for Fidel Castro’s funeral, one top official in Miami says he’s preparing for another possibility: increased immigration.   County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho said the district is getting ready for a ”potential influx of child and adult learners” after Castro’s death. ”We are ready to work with state and federal entities to secure the appropriate and necessary support to deliver educational services to all who, in light of today’s development, may arrive in our community,” Carvalho said in a statement Saturday.  ”Just as we did during the 1980 Mariel Boatlift and the 1994 Cuban rafter exodus, this school district will continue its   history of opening our arms to welcome, embrace, and educate all students.” It’s unclear how Castro’s death will impact emigration from the island. But a surge of immigrants from Cuba have already been making their way to the United States.  Experts say several factors are fueling a spike in the number of Cubans who brave dangerous journeys by land and by sea. Chief among them: fear that US policies that put Cubans on a fast track to legal residency could be repealed as relations between the two countries improve. Could that happen? It’s possible, but the reason might have more to do with who’s in the White House then who’s at the helm in Cuba.   Donald Trump has threatened to undo efforts by President Barack Obama to bring the US and Cuba closer together, although he said some sort of a deal is ”fine.” He’s also slammed the Cuban Adjustment Act, which makes Cuban immigrants eligible to apply for a green card after a year and a day in the country. Miami has been the epicenter of the Cuban exile community for decades. More than 260, 000 Cubans left in a   airlift between 1965 and 1973. In 1980, Castro let another 125, 000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. At other times, desperate Cubans have fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun. The trek remains dangerous, according to the US Coast Guard, and so far this year, thousands of people have made it. ”While there are not currently any indications of a mass migration, we are actively monitoring the situation and we have plans in place should we need to respond to one,” US Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Ryan Kelley said Monday.",-1.0
"When Blind People Do Algebra, The Brain’s Visual Areas Light Up. People born without sight appear to solve math problems using visual areas of the brain. A functional MRI study of 17 people blind since birth found that areas of visual cortex became active when the participants were asked to solve algebra problems, a team from Johns Hopkins reports in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ”And as the equations get harder and harder, activity in these areas goes up in a blind person,” says Marina Bedny, an author of the study and an assistant professor in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University. In 19 sighted people doing the same problems, visual areas of the brain showed no increase in activity. ”That really suggests that yes, blind individuals appear to be doing math with their visual cortex,” Bedny says. The findings, published online Friday, challenge the idea that brain tissue intended for one function is limited to tasks that are closely related. ”To see that this structure can be reused for something very different is very surprising,” says Melissa Libertus, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. ”It shows us how plastic our brain is, how flexible it is.” Earlier research found that visual cortex could be rewired to process information from other senses, like hearing and touch. But Bedny wanted to know whether this area of the brain could do something radically different, something that had nothing to do with the senses. So she picked algebra. During the experiment, both blind and sighted participants were asked to solve algebra problems. ”So they would hear something like: 12 minus 3 equals x, and 4 minus 2 equals x,” Bedny says. ”And they’d have to say whether x had the same value in those two equations.” In both blind and sighted people, two brain areas associated with number processing became active. But only blind participants had increased activity in areas usually reserved for vision. The result suggests the brain can rewire visual cortex to do just about anything, Bedny says. And if that’s true, she says, it could lead to new treatments for people who’ve had a stroke or other injury that has damaged one part of the brain. Drugs or even mental exercises might help a patient ”use a different part of your brain to do the same function,” Bedny says. ”And that would be really exciting.”",-0.5
"EXCLUSIVE - Radical UK Preacher: British Muslims Want Their Own Islamic Nation - Breitbart. Muslims living in the UK increasingly want   and the implementation of Sharia law nationwide, according to radical Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary. [Choudary, speaking in an exclusive interview, was responding to polling data last month that suggests a fundamental gap between the values of British Muslims and the rest of society.  Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the activist who popularized the term Islamophobia, commented on the survey results. He explained the statistics show “the unacknowledged creation of a nation within the nation, with its own geography, its own values, and its own very separate future. ” Asked to respond to Phillips’ statement about a “nation within a nation,” Choudary replied: I think that we are increasingly heading toward that direction, definitely. The more the population grows, the more they find their roots, the more they want to implement Islam in their lives and the more they see around the world the failure of   democracies and socialist governments, the more they want  . And we can see that that is not just the case in the Middle East and Africa, but also in the West. People want to call for the Sharia. And we shouldn’t be surprised. Europe had the Sharia for about 800 years in Spain so why not in Britain? You know, we don’t call for the killing or the oppression of anyone. We want to live peacefully together. So why not try divine law? We tried secularism for long enough. The ICM poll found an astonishing two thirds of British Muslims would not inform law enforcement if they thought someone close to them became involved in a terrorist plot. Choudary said he was not surprised by that finding. We live at a time now, Aaron, of third or fourth generation Muslim communities. Where they have no trust of the government. Many people have grown up and all they have known are wars against Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan and now in Syria. So, you know, if you are    individual living in Britain for most of your life, you’ve seen wars against Muslims. So when you ask them these questions, whether they would actually cooperate with the police, they see the raids and arrests.  They see a lot of draconian laws which accompany these wars as well, and the Muslim community has been the recipient of these oppressive measures. We’re living in a kind of an apartheid state in Britain as a Muslim community today. The UK Express reported on the poll: The survey also discovered that more than half of Muslims think that homosexuality should be illegal in Britain and 23 percent of Muslims want Sharia to replace British law in certain parts of the country. The findings also revealed that 39 percent of Muslims thought that their wives should always obey their husbands and 31 percent thought it was acceptable to have more than one wife. A shocking five percent of Muslims sympathized with people who took part in stoning adulterers. Choudary is a founder of the outlawed,    Al Muhajiroun organization in Britain. He is currently awaiting trial in the U. K. for allegedly encouraging support for the Islamic State. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"Cotton: Obamacare Replacement Will Put the GOP House Majority at Risk - Breitbart. Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while discussing the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) said he was “afraid if they vote for the bill, they’ll put the House majority at risk next year. ”  Cotton said, “As it’s written today, this bill cannot pass the Senate. I believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of Americans and wouldn’t deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance to Americans. I would say to my friends in the house of representatives, with whom I serve, do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that cannot pass the Senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote. George, you were in the White House in 1993. You remember when House Democrats voted for a BTU energy tax. Not only did that not become law, it didn’t get a vote in the Senate. And those Democrats lost their next election because they voted on that tax. They call it getting BTU’d. I don’t think this bill can pass the Senate. And therefore, I think the house should take a pause and try to get as close as we can to a good result before they send to it the Senate. ” He added, “I’m afraid if they vote for the bill, they’ll put the House majority at risk next year. And we have majorities in the house and the senate and the White House. Not only to repeal Obamacare and get health care reform right, to reform our taxes and our regulations and to build up our military and to accomplish many other things. I don’t want to see the house put at risk on a bill that won’t pass the Senate. That’s why I think we should take a pause, try to solve as many of the problems on Medicaid and the individual insurance market in the bill in the house, and then allow the Senate to take its work up. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",1.0
"Footy McFooty Face Is Stomping Competition In Vote For MLS Team Name. Fans are embracing a San Diego group’s effort to bring a Major League Soccer team to the city  —   or at least, they’re embracing the most unlikely name for the squad. With the final round of an online vote set to close Friday, Footy McFooty Face has more than twice the votes of any other potential name. As of Monday, Footy McFooty Face led the way with nearly 7, 700 votes, well ahead of San Diego Surf (2, 341) and San Diego Bad Hombres (1, 644)  —   the only other names that have attracted more than 1, 000 votes. By tapping into the Internet’s love for silly names, the episode evokes the famous ”Boaty McBoatface” saga of last year, in which online voters chose that name to grace a $300 million British ocean research vessel. That U. K. result was overruled  —   and it seems likely that if MLS does expand to San Diego, its team won’t be wearing Footy McFooty Face jerseys. FS Investors, the backers of San Diego’s MLS bid, say they’ll submit the top 10 names to the league for review. As The San Diego   notes, the online vote plays into the hopes of FS Investors, as the group vies for attention and support for its plan to land an MLS team in Qualcomm Stadium, which up until January was known as the home of the San Diego Chargers. Perhaps Footy McFooty Face will go the way of Boaty, and be given to a less imposing entity. While Boaty McBoatface is now the name of a small submersible, might San Diego someday have a sports mascot named Footy McFooty Face? As the organizers note on their Facebook page, ”a nickname or mascot can be added to traditional names.” Here’s looking forward to the day we see an oversized foam foot patrolling the sidelines in Qualcomm Stadium.",-0.5
"Michigan Polls Put Donald Trump Far Ahead Of Ted Cruz, and John Kasich in Fourth Place - Breitbart. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lead with likely Michigan primary election voters, according to two polls released Sunday. [In the GOP primary race, Trump received 41 per cent of support from respondents, according to a NBC   Street   poll. Sen. Ted Cruz had 22 percent support, while Sen. Marco Rubio received just 17 per cent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in at 13 per cent. Only 5 per cent were undecided in the poll. Marist surveyed 482 Republican likely primary voters from March 1 to March 3.  A   poll released Sunday also showed Trump at 39 percent in Michigan, far ahead of Cruz at 24 percent. Rubio scored 16 percent and Kasich was in fourth place, with 15 percent. The March 2 to March 4 poll included 638 likely GOP primary voters. The two polls are every different from a poll by American Research Group, released late Saturday, which showed Kasich beating Trump, 33 percent to 31 percent. That ARG poll was conducted March 4 and March 5, and it shows Kasich doubling his   rating of 17 percent. But the poll was based on a small sample of 284   Republicans, plus responses from 116 independents and Democrats. When matched up    Cruz does better against Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Marist survey. Clinton beat Trump 53 per cent to 36 per cent in a hypothetical    race. Cruz polled better than Trump in these   losing to Clinton by only 7 per cent, said the Marist poll. The   poll showed Clinton beating Sanders, 55 percent to 44 percent, in Michigan. That Democratic poll questioned 597 likely Democratic primary voters, and was conducted March 2 to March 4. Clinton received 72 per cent of support, far outpacing Sanders’ 22 percent support. Democratic voters were more resolute in their decisions with 72 per cent strongly committed to their chosen candidate, 22 percent somewhat committed and a mere 5 per cent that expressed a willingness to vote differently. Clinton edges up among African American voters with 76 per cent to Sanders’ 21 per cent. However   independent voters strongly favor Sanders over Clinton by a margin of 27 points. The survey also showed that voters under age 45 backed Sanders, while voters above age 45 favored Clinton.

Republican candidates also will be up for election in Hawaii and Idaho on that day. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana",1.0
"5 big myths about the road to a billionaire business. Although small-business owners have more tools and sources of capital available to them than ever before, it still takes a lot to keep a start-up going. And a lot can go wrong, especially in the early days, if a founder hitches their ambitions to the wrong set of management principles. Longtime investors and business executives shared insights and lessons learned about the right mind-set for building a wildly successful business with aspiring entrepreneurs at iCONIC in Seattle. Greg Glassman, founder and CEO of CrossFit, believes that entrepreneurs who start businesses to make money will often find themselves on a wild goose chase. ""The universe doesn't care if you want to be rich,"" Glassman said at the iCONIC Conference in Seattle on Tuesday. ""Markets are unknowable."" ""Excellence stands like a beacon, a lighthouse,"" Glassman said. ""Excellence is obvious to everyone. Chase it. Pursue it."" He explained that entrepreneurs that aim to produce high-quality products and services will often find financial success as well. ""Shark Tank's"" Kevin O'Leary, founder of the O'Leary Financial Group, thinks that the most important quality of an entrepreneur is the ability to execute, because that is the foundation of a business. ""There's nothing worse than vision all day long. Vision is easy. Execution is hard,"" he said. O'Leary explained that entrepreneurs that are able to set goals, communicate them and are transparent about progress toward those goals are the ones that succeed. Danae Ringelmann, founder and chief development officer of Indiegogo, said that entrepreneurs should expect obstacles. ""When you're trying to do something new, you are going to face resistance,"" she said. In fact, while many successful entrepreneurs are renowned for their confidence, Ringelmann said besides the typical rejection and ridicule, one of the biggest forms of resistance is self-doubt. Ringlemann said that if entrepreneurs prepare for this hindrance rather than hide it, then they can at least be prepared to deal with reistance properly. Tilman Fertitta, CEO of Landry's and host of CNBC's ""Billion Dollar Buyer,"" said that in tough financial decisions, you can't hesitate to trim what's necessary. ""Don't be scared to make cuts. You can't save the world. If you want to be successful in business, you gotta be tough sometimes, and you better be tough in tough times,"" Fertitta said. He said that there's a surprising amount of excess in every business. Fertitta explained that while quality should never be sacrificed, there's always something that can be shaved off in every aspect of a business. ""Shark Tank's"" Robert Herjavec, founder and CEO of Herjavec Group, advises entrepreneurs to take advantage of the opportunities that are given to them, even if they feel daunting.

"Serious scrutiny needed as EPA seeks input on cancer ties to Monsanto herbicide | TheHill. The glyphosate geeks are gathering in Washington this week. After a two-month delay, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is holding four days of meetings aimed at examining the evidence that does or does not tie the world’s most widely used herbicide — glyphosate — to cancer. Scientists, activists and agricultural industry leaders are all expected to show up to either defend or attack the chemical that is currently at the center of international controversy. More than 250,000 public comments have been filed with the EPA ahead of the Dec. 13-16 meetings, and the agency is girding for more than 10 hours of personally delivered public comments before a specially appointed scientific advisory panel gets down to work. The panel assignment: To offer advice on how the EPA should evaluate and interpret relevant data and how it all should translate into a EPA “carcinogen risk” classification for glyphosate. The exercise is academic by design, but powerful economic forces are hard at work hoping to influence the outcome. Glyphosate is the billion-dollar-baby, the chief ingredient in Monsanto Co.’s branded Roundup herbicide as well as in hundreds of other herbicides sold around the world. It’s also the lynchpin to Monsanto’s top-selling, glyphosate-tolerant, genetically engineered crops. An official regulatory nod to cancer concerns could be devastating to Monsanto’s bottom line, not to mention it’s planned $66 billion merger with Bayer AG, as well as to other agrichemical companies that sell glyphosate products. Monsanto is also facing more than three dozen lawsuits over glyphosate cancer concerns and needs EPA backing to defend against the court actions. The questions about glyphosate and health issues are not new. Numerous scientific studies over multiple decades have raised concerns about harmful glyphosate impacts. Monsanto has always countered with its own studies and league of supportive scientists who say glyphosate is not carcinogenic and is one of the safest pesticides ever brought to market. Last year the argument got more heated after a team of international cancer scientists working with the World Health Organization (WHO) said that there was sufficient evidence in the body of research to classify glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. That news was particularly worrisome to consumers because glyphosate use is so pervasive that government researchers have documented the chemical as “widespread in the environment,”  found even in common foods like honey and oatmeal. It’s even found in urine samples of farmers and city dwellers alike. The controversy has delayed re-authorization decisions not only in the United States, but also in Europe. Several European countries, including Italy and France, have called for an outright ban on glyphosate after glyphosate residues have been found in numerous foods there. Residues found in bread products prompted a “Not in Our Bread” campaign in Britain. But despite the consumer angst on both sides of the Atlantic, the EPA has already made it clear it largely agrees with Monsanto’s message that the international cancer scientists are wrong. The agency issued a report in September laying out the reasons it proposes to classify glyphosate as “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.” To get to that finding, the agency had to inappropriately discount the results of numerous human and animal studies showing evidence of ties to cancer, according to many scientists who are asking the EPA to reconsider its position. “There are strong arguments for a classification of “Likely to be carcinogenic to humans” because there are multiple positive results in animals…  and positive epidemiologic studies strengthened by other lines of evidence (DNA and chromosomal damage in human cells and possibly exposed humans),” Maarten Bosland, professor of pathology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, wrote in comments submitted to the agency. Bosland is one of more than 90 scientists who issued a detailed report identifying the research that ties glyphosate to cancer. They say available human evidence shows an association between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; while significant carcinogenic effects are seen in laboratory animals for rare kidney and other types of tumors. History has given us numerous examples of chemicals that are declared safe for decades only to be proven dangerous after extended arguments like the one we’re now seeing over glyphosate. It’s been common practice for the corporate players who profit off chemical agents to fight tooth and nail for their continued use even as study after study builds a case of sometimes devastating environmental and human health costs. And it’s been equally common for weak-kneed regulators to do as industry bids. That appears to be the path EPA has followed with glyphosate. Ever since the agency announced last July that it would hold these meetings, the agrichemical industry’s trade group CropLife America has been working to make sure that the EPA repudiates the cancer concerns. CropLife first suggested the EPA scrap the meetings altogether, arguing there was no “scientific justification” for a review. The association then outlined criteria for the EPA to use in selecting scientists who might serve on the panel. And then after the panel was in place, CropLife told the EPA it should remove epidemiologist Dr. Peter Infante. CropLife considered him biased against the industry. The EPA responded by removing Infante as CropLife asked, and then refusing to explain its decision to the public, issuing a ‘no comment” to those who inquired about Infante’s removal. Infante, who has served as an expert consultant in epidemiology for the EPA and several world bodies, says allegations of bias are invalid, and he still plans to attend but in a different capacity. After the EPA kicked him off the advisory panel, the agency agreed to grant him a few minutes to address the panel during the public comment part of the agenda. He is slated to speak Thursday morning. In another hint at industry favoritism, earlier this year, the EPA “inadvertently” publicly posted an internal glyphosate assessment on its website that made a case for the safety of glyphosate. The document was up long enough for Monsanto to issue a press release gleefully tout the documents’ findings and providing a link to a copy of the document before the agency pulled it down, explaining it wasn’t final. The agency’s actions have left environmental and consumer activists disheartened and doubtful the EPA will listen to any serious independent scrutiny of glyphosate’s safety. “Their track record is awful,” said Patty Lovera, assistant director of the advocacy group Food & Water Watch. “We don’t want to throw in the towel entirely. We want to try to hold them to their mission. But there is clearly evidence of industry influence. They aren’t doing anything to inspire confidence that they’re taking a serious look at this.” Consumers rely on the EPA to prioritize their interests over corporate interests, and the EPA should not forget that, according to the public comment filed by Pamela Koch, executive director of the Laurie M. Tisch Center for Food, Education & Policy at Teachers College, Columbia University. “We urge the EPA to apply the precautionary principle in this review…” Koch wrote. “We believe that caring for the public health is of the upmost importance and need regulations that protect farm workers, workers who apply glyphosate in non-agricultural settings, as well as the general public.”  Carey Gillam is a veteran journalist, formerly with Reuters, who directs research for U.S. Right to Know, a nonprofit consumer education group focused on food safety and policy matters. Follow @CareyGillam on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/careygillam.  The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.

" Democrats Will Reintroduce A Major LGBT Bill As A Wedge Issue In Congress.  Democrats in Congress plan to reintroduce legislation this month that would ban LGBT discrimination nationwide, despite facing a conservative majority that’s been generally hostile toward the issue. While the bill has little shot of passage, progressives hope inaction by Republicans can illustrate a chasm between the major political parties as they approach the 2018 midterm election. “It’s important for Americans to know whether members of Congress support full equality for our community or whether they support continued discrimination against LGBT Americans,” Rhode Island’s David Cicilline, a Democrat who will sponsor the bill in the House, told BuzzFeed News. A companion bill will be reintroduced in the Senate by Oregon’s Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, who said colleagues opposed to the bill “should have to stand up and explain why. ” Dozens of Democrats sponsored similar legislation in 2015, with a small harmony of support across the aisle, marking the most sweeping effort to date to provide LGBT civil rights. But Republican leaders never gave it a committee hearing. Rep. Cicilline argued that opponents should pay a political price if they continue to blockade the bill, saying, “If Republicans in Washington want to keep standing in the doorway of opportunity, they’ll have to answer to their constituents in just two short years. ” The Equality Act, as it’s known, would amend existing civil rights laws to add protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in workplaces, housing, and public spaces. It would also clarify that transgender students can use   facilities in schools in accordance with their gender identity, possibly settling a dispute tangled in courts. President Donald Trump has helped shift his party toward more   language, offering pledges of general support  —   but his cabinet brings a trove of   views. The administration recently withdrew protections for transgender students and Trump himself has endorsed states creating their own policies that allow discrimination. Cicilline argued in a   letter seeking House   this week that a    patchwork of LGBT rights underscores the need for a consistently applied federal law. Despite winning marriage equality at the Supreme Court, for example, gay people can still be fired in the dozens of states where LGBT discrimination remains legal. “We need a uniform federal standard that protects all LGBT Americans from discrimination,” the letter says. Polls have show most Americans believe LGBT people should be protected from discrimination. “Every member of Congress should have to be counted and show exactly where they stand: either for or against full equality for all Americans,” Sen. Merkley told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “In 2017, any elected leader who wants to use their position to maintain outdated and discriminatory policies should have to stand up and explain why. ” Several congressional Republicans have cited concerns from religious conservatives who claim their faith is at odds with accommodating LGBT people, particularly with selling merchandise for   weddings. The Equality Act would not add new religious exemptions rather, it would let stand the religious protections codified in existing civil rights laws. But at least one Republican lawmaker and some LGBT conservatives have argued that the only way to advance LGBT nondiscrimination legislation in Congress with the current Republican majority is by adding new provisions for people with religious objections.

"FBI Explains Why It Won’t Disclose How It Unlocked iPhone. The FBI has officially decided it can’t tell Apple how the agency hacked into the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. The FBI paid undisclosed professional hackers more than $1 million to get inside the locked and encrypted iPhone 5C through a previously unknown flaw in the software. The agency has been weighing whether it would submit the details to a review process that helps decide whether software vulnerabilities known to the government should be disclosed to companies. FBI science and technology chief Amy Hess said in a statement on Wednesday that the agency has determined it won’t be able to submit the   iPhone hack to the review, called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process: ”The VEP cannot perform its function without sufficient detail about the nature and extent of a vulnerability. ”The FBI purchased the method from an outside party so that we could unlock the San Bernardino device. We did not, however, purchase the rights to technical details about how the method functions, or the nature and extent of any vulnerability upon which the method may rely in order to operate. As a result, currently we do not have enough technical information about any vulnerability that would permit any meaningful review under the VEP process.” This was exactly the kind of challenge predicted by Robert Knake, former director of cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council in the Obama administration, in his recent interview with NPR. Knake offered a detailed description of how the Vulnerabilities Equities Process works and suggested that intellectual property lawyers will in the future fight over whether hackers can own the rights to a vulnerability.",-0.5
"Canadian Millennials: Winning. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. American Millennials aren’t doing so hot: Compared to how their parents were doing when they were in their 20s, they’re less likely to have a job, they’re making less money on average, and they’re less likely to own a home. The   story of North American Millennials, though, includes another narrative, one that’s a lot cheerier: Canadians’. Canadians between the ages of 25 and 35, according to a report from TD Bank, are doing quite well, relatively speaking. They’re wealthier, more likely to be employed, and more likely to own a home than their American counterparts. As of last year, for instance, about 36 percent of American Millennials were homeowners, while more than half of Canadian Millennials owned a house. On a similar note, more than half of Canadian Millennials bought their first homes at an earlier age than their parents did. Homeownership Rates for Americans and Canadians Under 35, Perhaps more Canadian Millennials are able to afford houses because they had better luck during the recession? Not so, it turns out: Canadian Millennials and American Millennials both accounted for about 70 percent of job losses during the recession. What’s been different between the two countries since then is how the employment rates between these two generations have diverged: Employment Rates for Americans and Canadians Between 25 and 34, A big cause of this gap, though, goes back to a development that predates the recession by nearly a decade. Through the ’80s and ’90s, American and Canadian women between the ages of 25 and 34 were roughly equally likely to be employed. But then, around 2000, as can be seen in the graph above, their fates diverged pretty dramatically. That happens to be the time —  “likely not a coincidence,” the authors of the TD report write —  when the Canadian government expanded its parental leave requirement from 10 weeks to 35, a policy change that particularly affects this demographic. With so many   households, it’s no surprise that household income has been rising in Canada in a way that it hasn’t been in the U. S. Canadians between 25 and 35 are making more money now than Canadians in that same age group were 15 years ago —  something that’s not true of young Americans now and young Americans 15 years ago. (It’s important to read the following graph not as a comparison between Canadians’ earnings and Americans’ earnings in any given year —  because that’d be mixing up currencies and buying power —  but as a comparison of how today’s Canadians and Americans stand relative to Canadians who were between the ages of 25 and 35 in any given year.) How Today’s   to    Americans and Canadians Compare to 2000’s: Household Income in the Past 15 Years, by Country, So what on earth is Canada’s secret? The answer isn’t exactly mysterious: wise policy making. For one thing, there was that   expansion, circa 2000, that made it much easier for women to work. And then there is higher education. Households led by Canadians 35 or younger held on average roughly $16, 000 (U. S. dollars) in   debt in 2012 in 2013, the corresponding average in America was $27, 000. Students in Canada are graduating with less debt because tuition costs have been rising much more slowly there than in the U. S. with public universities remaining quite affordable. On top of all this, it can’t hurt that Canada has a social safety net that’s much more thorough than America’s. True, some of Canadian Millennials’ prosperity is a matter of good luck. Home values in their country have nearly doubled in the last decade, leaving their parents more money to pass along to their children than America’s Baby Boomers had after a decade of volatile housing prices. But even that is to some extent the product of good public policy: The Economist chalks Canada’s avoidance of a housing crash to “prudent banking regulation. ” In the next few years, though, TD Bank expects this   gap to narrow. Canada’s housing market has matured to a point where it’s hard to see it expanding substantially, whereas economists are predicting increased numbers of Millennial homeowners in the U. S.

I don’t care how long you’ve done this or that. ’” The new boss seemed to be sending the message that the way Ms. Sabo approached   and development was out of date. “At the end of the day, it felt like, ‘You need to come into the new millennium,’’’ she said. “I used to chuckle and wonder what kind of relationship he had with his mother. ” Despite her growing discomfort, she tried to do her job and avoid conversation or confrontation with the boss  —   who first demoted her, then fired her. “He told me that I wasn’t hitting my goals, but that’s not true,” said Ms. Sabo, who has a new job and an older boss. “I think it was that we butted heads. Some of it was style, but some of it was generational. ” Companies these days are looking to fill the management ranks with people who are “digital natives,” which frequently translates to millennials and Gen  . Meanwhile, more baby boomers are staying on the job longer, and some retirees, looking for a second act, are rejoining the ranks of the employed, at least part time. Consequently, the odds are increasing that older workers will be answering to managers young enough to be their children. A 2014 Harris Interactive survey on behalf of CareerBuilder, a job recruitment website, found that 38 percent of American workers had a younger boss, up from 34 percent in 2012. “Obviously, there have always been younger people in the work force, but in the past, younger workers were on the lower floors and older workers were executives on the upper floors and in the executive dining room,” said Jill Chapman, a senior performance consultant with Insperity, a personnel management firm. But because younger workers now have the advantage in sheer numbers, “there are more opportunities for them to move into management roles,” Ms. Chapman continued. “They’re in their 30s, and they’ve had lots of experience because of internships we older workers gave them when they were in high school and college. They had those experiences, and they had the chops for exec positions at an earlier age. ” If older workers have difficulty adjusting, there’s a good reason: It goes against the natural order that the subordinate would have several decades on the supervisor. “Research shows that older workers are not as responsive to that younger boss, because they feel he or she shouldn’t be in that position,” said Orlando Richard, an associate professor of management at the University of Texas at Dallas, who recently completed a study on status incongruence. There are implications for the organization, too. “The older workers with younger bosses are less committed to the company,” Professor Richard said. “They’re not as engaged in the job. If they’re close to retirement, they may not leave, but they may not work as hard. ” Of course, there are plenty of older workers who continue to give the job their all, even though they now report to someone who thinks of Nirvana as an oldies band. The way they see it, though, that younger boss sure doesn’t make it easy. Faye Keller, a public affairs specialist in the health care field in Salt Lake City, was 60 when she got a boss who was half her age. “At the beginning, I wasn’t too concerned  —   I was ready to look for his strengths,” Ms. Keller said But then she started being excluded from certain meetings. At those meetings she did attend, “I’d say something, and my boss would respond ‘yeah, ’ and move on to another topic. ” Colleagues closer to her boss’s age were invited to hang out in his office. “I felt ostracized,” said Ms. Keller, who is now 64. She also felt micromanaged. “I would go out of the building to meet with prospective clients, and when I explained that I was trying to develop relationships, he would tell me I could do it over the phone and through email,” Ms. Keller said. “I don’t believe I’m old school in my ideas, but I think face to face is essential in building successful relationships, and he didn’t value that. ” The boss stayed she went. There are challenges on both sides of the   workplace divide. Older workers may feel they’ve lost their shot at running the show, and younger workers may feel their older subordinates just can’t wait for them to mess up, said David Stillman, an author of the new book “Gen Z @ Work. ” The  : his son, Jonah, 17, perhaps a future younger boss. Further, older workers, accustomed to the parental role, may reflexively offer advice to younger bosses who chafe at the effrontery. “They’ll say, ‘In my day   …    ’ implying ‘your day is wrong,’” Mr. Stillman said. For their part, some younger bosses act as though the world began only when they arrived on the scene, “which makes older workers feel that their own considerable experience doesn’t matter,” Mr. Stillman added. Older workers may be made to feel that they’re dinosaurs. Younger bosses may think that, yeah, the older worker is kind of a dinosaur. “My social media skills and computer skills weren’t up to par,” Ms. Keller said. “I’m willing to admit that. ” Some companies are making efforts to address the issue. ATT, for example, offers supervisors a   course, “Managing the   Workforce,” which “helps prepare them to effectively communicate with and motivate their direct reports,” said Jan Rasmussen, a company spokeswoman. And not every older worker feels marginalized or unappreciated, nor does every younger boss feel disdainful and misunderstood. “I don’t look at age  —   I look at business intelligence,” said Valentino Lanoce, 54, the regional director of operations for the restaurant chain Verts Mediterranean Grill, who reports to the company’s founders, Dominik Stein, 29, and Michael Heyne, 32. “Dominik and Michael respect my experience in the industry, and they’ll ask for my opinion and advice. It’s very collaborative. ” Mr. Lanoce said that his interview with Mr. Stein and Mr. Heyne “was like sitting with mature officers of a company. ” He said: “They’re disciplined and professional. Otherwise, I never would have left where I was to come and work with them. ” When talking about her tour of duty at O’Connell  Goldberg, a public relations firm in Hollywood, Fla. Karen Dennis, 60, likes to invoke “The Intern,” the 2015 comedy that starred Robert De Niro as an unpaid septuagenarian assistant to a much younger chief executive. Ms. Dennis, a former administrative social worker and marketing consultant, had always wanted to work for a P. R. agency  —   badly enough to work without pay. Nine years ago, through a connection, she got her chance at O’Connell  Goldberg. “Social media was starting to emerge, and I was so lacking in skills,” Ms. Dennis said. She clearly learned quickly. After nine months, she was offered a paid position her boss, Barbara Goldberg, a founder of the company, was 10 years her junior. “There’s a great work ethic with older workers,” Ms. Goldberg said. “They come on time, and they stay, and they’re  . They also avoid petty drama, because this isn’t their first time at the rodeo. ” Ms. Goldberg said that Ms. Dennis filled an important role: “Karen was so nurturing and motherly to the younger employees  —   she had the time and patience, and I didn’t. ” But there were some tensions. “As a    I tended to step back and assess a situation,” Ms. Dennis said. “When you’re that age, you don’t see jumping in as being to your best advantage, because you haven’t yet seen the whole picture. ” Her boss’s philosophy, on the other hand, was “jump in. ” Ms. Dennis remembers being part of a conference call with a new client. She was silent throughout the conversation, and afterward, was yanked into Ms. Goldberg’s office. “Barbara told me, ‘I need to hear from you,’” Ms. Dennis said. “And I responded, ‘I didn’t have anything to say.’ I wanted to understand the dynamics of the other team before I spoke. I promised that on the next call, I would be more forceful and part of the conversation  —   and I was. ” “It’s a dance you do,” added Ms. Dennis, who was with the firm for more than six years before leaving to freelance she remains close to Ms. Goldberg. “It’s like marriage,” Ms. Dennis said. “My boss would say, ‘This is what I want,’ and I would say, ‘This is what I can do. ’” As in many new relationships, there’s a struggle to find a way. Diversity issues have long been a part of the terrain, and “there are all these hangups at first,” said Ms. Chapman of Insperity. It was a similar dynamic, she said, when women were coming into the work force. “It’s something we have to work through, and we have to figure out how to make it work,” Ms. Chapman said.",-1.0
"Lars von Trier inspired by Donald Trump for new serial-killer film. Lars von Trier, the Danish auteur whose films have rarely shied from controversy, is to make a film inspired in part by new US president Donald Trump. The previously announced The House That Jack Built stars Matt Dillon in the title role as a “highly intelligent” man we follow over 12 years. The film “introduces the murders that define [his] development as a serial killer”. Speaking on 13 February, Von Trier explained the project’s origins further: “The House That Jack Built celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless, which is sadly proven by the recent rise of the Homo trumpus  —   the rat king. ” Last week, Von Trier shared a photo to promote the film: of himself, in period costume, with scythe, tolling a bell. He described the picture as “an evocative image with a cinematic reference”  —   apparently to fellow Dane Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1932 horror Vampyr.  The director has largely refrained from commenting on his films since he was declared “persona non grata” at the Cannes film festival after making a joke about Hitler at a press conference for the film Melancholia in 2011. His next film, Nymphomaniac (2014) premiered in two halves at the Berlin film festival. A hardcore odyssey featuring real sex, it starred regular collaborator Charlotte Gainsbourg alongside Uma Thurman and Shia LaBeouf. LaBeouf’s   in American Honey, Riley Keough, will also feature in The House That Jack Built, alongside The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl.  Von Trier has never been to the US, but many of his films are set there, including 2009’s Antichrist, in which Gainsbourg takes sharp implements to her and husband Willem Dafoe’s genitals and Dogville (2003) a Brechtian epic that sees visitor Nicole Kidman enslaved by local townsfolk. The end credits of that film involved stills of atrocities committed before the end of slavery, to the sound of David Bowie’s Young Americans.  The House That Jack Built begins shooting in Sweden in March, before moving to Copenhagen in May. It will be released in 2018.",-0.5
"‘Safe Transfer Act’ Would Brand Transcripts of Students Ensnared in Campus Sex-Crimes Tribunals. No longer content to deny due process to university students facing often unsubstantiated or false accusations of sexual harassment and assault, activists now aim to destroy any hope for them to transfer to other colleges and universities. In Congress on December 8, Representative Jackie Speier (D. Calif.) introduced the Safe Transfer Act, which would require transcript notation for students who try to transfer after being found “responsible” for violations of Title IX policies on sexual harassment and assault. The bill would create a new “check the box” requirement specifically for the transcripts of the (mostly) male students who have become ensnared in Title IX’s   net for campus “sex crimes. ” In a press release introducing the bill, Speier says that the Safe Transfer Act would ensure that a student who tries to transfer to another college or university would face the “consequences” of his violations of his present school’s policies on sexual harassment and assault. The proposed legislation would also be a warning to colleges and universities that they would “be admitting someone that poses a threat to the students and staff on their campus. ” In many Title IX cases, accused students are not given due process, but Speier seems to assume that campuses provide them a fair hearing. Under the policies that many colleges and universities have implemented, accused students are often denied a chance to respond to allegations, not informed of their options for resolving the complaints, not given copies of the incident report or other evidence against them before the hearing, and not allowed to call witnesses on their behalf. On many campuses, they are denied full legal representation and the right to   witnesses. Perhaps Speier does not realize that her proposed bill would put colleges and universities at great risk. Just ask administrators at Gonzaga University who ran afoul of privacy protections in a campus   case more than two decades ago. A former Gonzaga student, an aspiring teacher, had been an   major and failed to gain certification from Washington State. It turns out that Roberta League, a Gonzaga administrator, had told representatives of the state’s   office that he was accused of raping another student, who, however, never filed charges and in a videotaped deposition denied that the accused student had sexually assaulted her. The accused student sued the university for negligence, defamation, and invasion of privacy. The court ruled that, by reporting the   charges in his educational records, Gonzaga had violated the his privacy and civil rights. He won the case and was awarded $1. 15 million by the Washington State supreme court. In October, at the Department of Education, the Office for Civil Rights found that Wesley College in Delaware had violated the Title IX rights of a male student who was accused of sexual assault, and a federal appeals court revived a lawsuit by a male Columbia student who alleged that the university had subjected him to sex discrimination during its investigation of a   report against him. There has also been an increase in the number of   settlements, including those at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Xavier in Ohio, and Swarthmore. And, just last week, a Title IX investigation involving former Baylor football recruit Jeremy Faulk was suspended, probably never to be resolved. Speier’s bill arrives at a time of growing recognition that college campuses have already lost credibility in their handling of Title IX violations. Worse, the bill would destroy the future of many young men who have been wrongfully accused of sexual abuse on their college campuses. President Obama is directing federal agencies to “ban the box” in their hiring decisions, prohibiting them from asking prospective government employees about their criminal histories on job applications. Arguing that the “federal government should not use criminal history to screen out applicants before we even look at their qualifications,” Obama made the announcement at Rutgers University just a week before the university announced yet another   lawsuit, against two football players who allegedly had sexual relations   with an intoxicated woman. More Higher Education Professor Laments Being Forced to Waste Time on Title IX ‘Training’Why Keep Colleges from Being Responsible Lenders?  MedsRepublican lawmakers, including the incoming attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have introduced the Safe Campus Act, which would require   complaints to be handled by the police. If a student alleging a campus sexual assault chooses to keep the accusation from law enforcement, institutions may not initiate disciplinary hearings against the accused. In contrast with the fatally flawed Speier bill, it is sensible, an acknowledgment that crimes should be adjudicated in courts, not by unqualified campus officials.,",1.0
"France Eases Rules for Police to Carry Guns While Off Duty - The New York Times. PARIS  —   France eased its gun rules on Wednesday to allow   police officers to carry their sidearms even if the nation is not in a state of emergency. The move was a response to an attack on Monday in which an Islamic State assailant fatally stabbed a policeman and his companion at their home while their child was there. The eased rules, welcomed by France’s police unions, came as the authorities in Belgium alerted police that more attacks appeared to be in advanced planning stages and could be imminent. A group of extremists have left Syria and divided into smaller groups headed for Belgium and France, the warning said. The information was reported by a Belgian newspaper, La Dernière Heure, which said police had received an alert that “combatants left Syria about a week and a half ago in order to reach Europe via Turkey and Greece, by boat, without passports. ” Belgian counterterrorism officials tried to play down the significance of the warning. The Belgian Coordinating Body for Threat Analysis, which reviews and evaluates intelligence and other   information, did not raise the country’s alert level, and said in a statement that the warning, leaked to the newspaper, “had not been contextualized and, in its current form, has no direct impact on the current threat level. ” Brussels, the capital, was virtually shut down in November after attacks in and around Paris left 130 people dead and the authorities warning of the possibility of an imminent attack in Belgium. Officials did not dispute the authenticity of the new warning, which described the   assailants as armed and poised to strike. Among the possible targets in Belgium were embassies, restaurants, hospitals, hotels, concert halls and pedestrian streets, according to the warning. When pressed about the information, Paul Van Tigchelt, the director of the   body  —   known by its French initials, OCAM, as well as its Flemish initials, OCAD  —   described it as “raw intelligence. ” Raw intelligence generally refers to information that is largely unverified, may originate from a single source and has not yet been corroborated. However, with the Euro 2016 soccer tournament underway in France and drawing huge crowds to city centers and areas around stadiums, the report from Belgium was consistent with assessments by security officials that its neighbor faces a persistent and serious risk. There are already a number of Belgian and French citizens or residents who have fought for the Islamic State or other groups in Syria or Iraq and then returned home, as was the case with a number of people who took part in either the Paris or Brussels attacks. In testimony before Belgium’s Parliament on Wednesday, Justice Minister Koen Geens said that as of June 7, 114 Belgian fighters had returned from the   conflict zone and that seven of them had since died. The number of returnees in France is about 244, one of the top French intelligence officials, Patrick Calvar, told lawmakers last month. French officials did not respond specifically to Belgium’s most recent warning of returning jihadists. But Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France, speaking on France Inter radio Wednesday, made clear that the country must be prepared for more attacks. “Other innocent people will lose their lives,” he said. “You could accuse me of making society even more anxious than it already is, given all the events that have happened. But sadly, this is the reality. ” He was referring not only to the November attacks, but also to the fatal stabbings in France on Monday by an extremist who asserted loyalty to the Islamic State. “This is generational, we have hundreds of individuals who are radicalized,” Mr. Valls said. There was no change to the threat level in France on Wednesday. France has maintained a state of emergency since the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, and considers the risk of attack high. However, French police officers were particularly on edge after stabbings on Monday of an   officer and his companion, an Interior Ministry employee. The country’s police unions met with Interior Ministry officials on Wednesday and emerged saying they had received indefinite permission to carry their work guns, even when off duty. They are permitted to do so now under    provisions, but those will expire on July 26. Many police officers had worried that the expiration would make them more vulnerable. The extended permission for   carrying, given by Bernard Cazeneuve, the interior minister, is not permanent, but does not have an end date. A far less nervous and combative mood prevailed in Magnanville, the small town west of Paris where the stabbings took place. About 200 people gathered at noon on Wednesday for a moment of silence at the end of the street where the policeman lived with his family. They listened quietly to remarks from the town’s mayor and sang the national anthem, “La Marseillaise. ” Only a few of the mourners complained that France had too many mosques, a   sentiment expressed in parts of France in response to fears of Islamic extremists. Men representing area Muslim groups came to pay their respects, standing a bit apart as if they were outsiders, although they were from neighboring towns. One of them, Abdelaziz El Jaouhari, who is the secretary general for the Council of Muslims for the department of Yvelines, said France needed more proper mosques to help fight radicalism. A department is a local unit of government, similar to a county. “We do not have enough official places of prayer for the community, and it is much better for young people to be in official places of worship rather than with those networks they find in basements and I don’t know where,” Mr. Jaouhari said.",-1.0
"Holtzman: We forget Watergate at our peril.  (CNN) Watergate has recast its long shadow. The President, taking a page out of Richard Nixon’s playbook, has fired someone investigating him.  FBI Director James Comey was terminated most likely because of his continued investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton. Collusion, if found and proven, could be treason or another federal crime. Firing Comey, if done to stymie the Russia investigation, could be obstruction of justice. Either act could be an impeachable offense. To be sure, there are superficial differences between the present situation and Nixon’s 1973 order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, to which many have likened it. First, the FBI director is not the special prosecutor. Second, President Nixon made it crystal clear why he wanted Cox fired    to stop him from getting White House tapes proving Nixon covered up the Watergate  . We don’t know for certain why President Trump fired Comey, but appearances all point to a similar motive: trying to sabotage the FBI’s Russia investigation. Trump’s stated rationales for the firing don’t hold water. How Comey handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was   when Donald Trump took office. It makes no sense to wait almost three and a half months to fire Comey if the Clinton investigation was the reason. Trump now says he fired Comey because he wasn’t doing a good job. But that contradicts the explanations in the Department of Justice letters referenced in Trump’s firing letter. Nor does Trump appear to have made any serious inquiry into what kind of job Comey was doing.  In the last few weeks, the President repeatedly tweeted and stated investigating his campaign’s and Michael Flynn’s connections to Russia was a waste of time and money. But, clearly, he is obsessed with the Russia investigation and can’t seem to stop attacking it. Even after Comey’s dismissal, Trump’s deputy press secretary said we should ”move on” from the investigation, which further suggests that was the administration’s objective all along. My experience as a member of the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate and the impeachment of Richard Nixon suggests the next steps that need to be taken, and ”moving on” is not one of them.  First, Comey’s firing means we now need a special   counsel. No president should be above the law.  No president should control a criminal investigation of his own conduct. That is why Congress enacted the statute I authored in the wake of Watergate, which set up a virtually automatic mechanism for a   special prosecutor. Unfortunately, Congress let that mechanism lapse in 1999. Today the decision lies with the deputy attorney general, who has complete discretion over the matter. He might be responsive to public or congressional pressure and appoint a special prosecutor whose independence is above question    or he might not. If not, Sen. Schumer has proposed returning to something like the previous mechanism, so that a   panel would decide on appointing a special prosecutor. Either way, we need one. Second, Attorney General Sessions should now resign. He recused himself from the Russian investigation because he himself concealed information about his meetings with the Russians from the Senate during his confirmation hearings. Since it was apparent that firing Comey could have been related to that investigation, Sessions should have recused himself from that, too. Instead, he wrote to the President favoring Comey’s firing, which violated his recusal, making his position as AG untenable. Third, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should consider resigning as well. Once the attorney general recused himself, Rosenstein knew he might have to appoint a special prosecutor in the Russia investigation. Given that, it was a mistake in judgment to write his problematic memo supporting Comey’s firing, which quoted former attorneys general and deputies critical of Comey. Rosenstein took those quotes out of context it does not appear that any of those criticisms related to whether Comey should be removed. So Rosenstein’s memo was at best disingenuous and at worst deliberately misleading, neither of which the holder of his office can afford to be. Finally, Congress needs to take further action. The House and the Senate Intelligence Committees should redouble their efforts to uncover the truth. The Judiciary Committees of both bodies should investigate the firing. While President Trump may not have the strongest grasp of history, history matters deeply here. If like Nixon he obstructs criminal investigations into his own conduct, he, too, could find himself facing impeachment, possibly even prosecution.",-1.0
"Countering ISIS after the Istanbul Terror Attack. Michael Rubin (@mrubin1971) is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He frequently instructs the U. S. Navy and separately the FBI on issues relating to Middle Eastern politics, terrorism, and religious extremism. His latest book Kurdistan Rising is being released today. We talk here about the attack on the Istanbul airport yesterday.  —   KJL  Kathryn Jean Lopez: What do you make of an airport in a   country being attacked during Ramadan? Lopez: What do you make of ISIS not rushing to claim credit for the attack? Rubin: It could mean any number of things: There might be factionalism within ISIS. ISIS may believe that the attack is more important than the claim of responsibility. It could also be a new group. They may also want to keep Turkey and the world guessing. If enough people are talking about ISIS, they have achieved their aim, claim of responsibility or not.  Rubin: Really, a lot of things worry me. First, many diplomats, government officials, and journalists still don’t get what makes ISIS so attractive. Remember this Newsweek piece from a decade ago, ridiculing President George W. Bush for even talking about the idea of a caliphate as if it were anything more than a historical artifact? We are so hobbled by political correctness that we are unable to craft an effective strategy to counter ISIS. President Obama has focused U. S. strategy on Syria and Iraq, but that’s like playing chess and only caring about two squares on the board. What about Libya, the Sinai, Nigeria, and Afghanistan? Second, even if Abu Bakr   is killed, he has succeeded in reviving the notion of a caliphate in contemporary debate, and that is only going to be augmented by the forthcoming 100th anniversary of Turkey’s abolition of the caliphate in 1924. Also, remember that many Muslims believe that there will be a specific number of caliphates before the end of times, and so Abu Bakr   wins by losing, as he has started the countdown. And, last, we need to worry about whom ISIS inspires. People talk about “lone wolf” terrorism, but the wolf is no longer really alone. After all,   publishes Inspire magazine and ISIS publishes Dabiq. They are essentially instruction manuals for terrorism, and so every U. S. airport, shopping mall, and elementary school remain at risk. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Lopez: What worries you most about Turkey? Rubin: The terrorism Turkey faces is only beginning. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan flirted with ISIS (and other radical groups) and at times supported them, so long as they focused their violence against Erdoğan’s political and diplomatic adversaries. What Turkey is experiencing today is simply blowback, in much the same way that Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Syria have all experienced blowback from the radical Islamists their regimes once supported. We still pussyfoot around Turkey too much because we are afraid to cause the mercurial Erdoğan any offense. He has transformed Turkey into Pakistan on the Mediterranean, however, and it’s time for some tough love, before things get worse. Lopez: What do you make of the scuffle between Turkish officials and the Vatican this week? Pope Francis referred to the Armenian genocide during his visit to Armenia and he was labeled a crusader for it. Rubin: Erdoğan is prickly and responds with bombast to rally his brownshirts against those whom he feels have slighted him. Truth simply doesn’t matter to Erdoğan. In recent years, Islamist and nationalist thugs in Turkey have attacked and killed priests, and I’m afraid what Erdoğan is doing is simply giving them a green light to do so again. Lopez: What would you most have presidential candidates consider about Islamic terrorism? Rubin: “It’s the ideology, stupid. ” Too many diplomats and politicians still see the world through the lens of grievance. But forcing ourselves or our allies to make concessions in the face of terror is never a formula for success it is a formula for more violence. Lopez: Obviously ISIS will kill whomever it doesn’t like, but it also has specific stated goals of exterminating religious minorities. What more can the U. S. do for them? Rubin: Religious minorities should be our focus when it comes to asylum. More ISIS America’s War against ISIS Is Evolving into an Invasion of SyriaAt What Point Is Islamist Rhetoric a Crime? Is Supporting ISIS Just Another ‘Political Point of View’? Lopez: What is our blindest     spot? Rubin: Again, our diplomats want to see the root of terrorism in grievance. They believe the problem is poverty or lack of education or Israel. The facts suggest otherwise. Most terrorists are educated and  . The Arab Spring shows how cursory Israel is to the everyday concerns of people in the region. And the fact that Muslim Brotherhood terrorism was flagged by the U. S. intelligence community as a direct threat to the United States in 1946, a year before the partition of Palestine and two years before the creation of Israel, suggests we’ve got to stop seeing the only democracy in the region as the problem. Lopez: What gives you actual hope these days, in the face of all the violence and chaos and confusion about so many things? Rubin: Eight years of denial and sycophancy in the White House are coming to an end. With a little luck, we can have a fresh start and actually calibrate a policy to evidence rather than to wishful thinking or a White House —  constructed echo chamber.,",1.0
"Move Over, Sheep. Doves Are Returning Home To Tiny Island Of Socorro. In the coming year, scientists are hoping to reintroduce the Socorro dove to Socorro Island, a place where the bird has died out. Socorro, the ancestral home of the dove, is part of an island group off the west coast of Mexico nicknamed the Mexican Galapagos. In the 1920s, the California Academy of Sciences noticed island birds and animals were disappearing fast. So the academy sent an expedition to Socorro with instructions to bring back live doves. Juan Martinez, a scientist with Mexico’s Institute of Ecology, hiked the same terrain as the researchers a century ago. He said he plans to slowly reintroduce the doves to the wild. ”We’re going to camp in that area, where you see the green and the red,” Martinez said. ”In that area is a heavier forest and is where they found the Socorro doves. That’s why all this exercise is helping us find the locations. The best place to bring them back is a similar place where they found them.” The original expedition brought back 17 doves and sent them to zoos and aviaries across the United States and Europe. The plan was to breed them in captivity. But although they survived at the zoos, they died off on the island. ”Here on Socorro you have introduced sheep, introduced cats and introduced mice,” Martinez said. Cats and mice preyed on the birds and their eggs. But the biggest problem, Martinez said as he pointed to the hillside, was the sheep. ”That’s probably the highest point where they completely removed vegetation,” Martinez said. The sheep chewed and trampled their way through the forest, destroying the Socorro dove’s home. ”And at the end, all of that material goes to the sea and it is tons and tons of soil that were lost by the impact of sheep,” Martinez said. Martinez, along with his team, has spent the past several years aggressively removing sheep and replanting native trees. There’s also ongoing work to rid the island of cats and mice. But even with all that work, Martinez said reintroductions are full of uncertainty. Michelle Reynolds, a biologist for the U. S. Geological Survey and a reintroduction specialist, said to expect surprises when returning the doves to Socorro. She said she knows of Hawaiian ducks that were moved from one island to another, only to take off over the open ocean and never be seen again. ”There could be a new threat, one that didn’t exist when the species used to live there,” Reynolds said. For example, she said, avian diseases, such as West Nile, are more prevalent now. It’s also unknown how captivity might have changed the birds. The doves might have lost traits needed to live in the wild. ”You might lose some aggression you might lose vigilance,” Reynolds said. ”There’s lots of characteristics that can change over many, many generations in captivity.” Martinez said this might seem like a lot of work for one small species on a tiny island. But other birds on this island are teetering on extinction, he said. He and other scientists believe the effort to return the doves to Socorro will also help the other endangered species. ”It’s not restoration by restoring or reintroducing one species,” Martinez said. ”At the end what you want is to restore the ecological interactions that interplay on the island. And once you do that, the island will go back to its original course.” This reintroduction is a process scientists a century ago might never have imagined. Martinez might not even see the end of it. It could be decades before the doves can flourish on their own. It’s a long, difficult and costly effort. But Martinez said he believes it’s ultimately worth giving the doves  —   and the island  —   another chance.",-0.5
"The Resistance Now: sorry Trump, but we’re sticking with Paris, activists say. There was plenty of gloom this week as the US elected to join Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries not backing the Paris accord on climate change. But activists immediately responded, outlining plans to resist Trump, and elected officials across the country said they would ignore the president’s pullout and abide by the terms of the Paris agreement. The Sierra Club is urging people to call the White House, and 350. org listed some of the wins that have already emerged from the accord, and immediately launched a petition. Governors from 10 states have said they will abide by the terms of the accord, and 83 mayors from across the country have committed to “adopt, honor, and uphold the commitments to the goals enshrined in the Paris agreement. ” Those goals include striving to limit temperatures to 1. 5C above   levels and achieving net zero carbon emissions in the second half of the century. The mayors include Eric Garcetti from Los Angeles, Marty Walsh from Boston and Bill de Blasio from New York City. PS: regarding Syria and Nicaragua not signing up to the Paris accord, the Guardian’s Haroon Siddique says that those countries’ “reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax. ” Read Haroon’s piece here. Former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016, announced his bid for Maryland governor on Wednesday, and will speak at the People’s Summit in Chicago next weekend. Jealous joins Sanders in speaking at the summit, where thousands of activists will meet for workshops and activism training sessions. He sits on the board of Our Revolution and the Huffington Post reckons his candidacy “is liable to nationalize the primary, turning it into yet another proxy war between the party’s progressive and establishment wings. ” We’ll be reporting from the People’s Summit all weekend, from   June, and producing a super special edition of this newsletter from Chicago.  The future of Illinois’ minimum wage is now in Governor Bruce Rauner’s hands, after the state’s house and senate approved a bill that would raise the mandatory payment from $8. 25 to $15 an hour by 2022. Activists with Fight for $15 have spent years campaigning for the increase in Illinois and around the country. On 24 May, thousands of people marched in Chicago to protest against McDonald’s wages, but demonstrations in Illinois go back to at least 2013, when   workers went on strike to demand a raise. The House voted in favor of the bill 61 to 53 on Tuesday, and the Senate approved it   on Wednesday. Rauner, a Republican, has not indicated how he plans to act. His press office told the Guardian the bill is “currently under review”. • “Don’t just blame Trump for quitting the Paris deal  —   blame the Republican party,” says Andrew Prokop over at Vox. Trump’s decision has been portrayed as a decision driven by his   advisers, Prokop says  —   but actually, the president is “solidly within the GOP’s consensus on climate change”. • The Democratic party “continues to assume that power shall simply be given to it by dint of their being ‘not Trump’,” writes Douglas Williams. Williams says the party is paying scant regard to progressives who have the energy to defeat Republicans in the 2018  . Cities around the country lit their buildings green on Thursday, in a show of support for the Paris agreement. It’s unlikely to change Trump’s mind on Paris, but it still offered a little bit of hope after a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.",-0.5
"Study: What Was The Impact Of The Iconic Photo Of The Syrian Boy?. Editor’s Note: The photos in this story may be distressing to some viewers.  More than one year later, the photo that woke up the world to the Syrian refugee crisis remains indelible:    Aylan Kurdi lying face down on a sandy beach in Turkey. The Syrian boy’s lifeless body had washed ashore after the rubber boat carrying him and his family  —   to what they had hoped would be new lives in Greece  —   capsized. Now the image has become the focus of a study examining how a single photo of a single individual could stir the emotions and arouse public concern more powerfully than statistical reports of body counts, which at that point  —   five years into Syria’s civil war  —   had reached the hundreds of thousands. Until the photo appeared in September 2015, people did not seem focused on the humanitarian crisis in Syria. But Aylan’s photo mobilized empathy and concern, soon bringing in record donations to charitable organizations around the world to aid the victims. As the study shows, however, such immediate outpourings can be  . The number of average daily amount of donations to the Swedish Red Cross campaign for Syrian refugees, for instance, was 55 times greater in the week after the photo (around $214, 300) than the week before ($3, 850). By the second week, the donation totals had already begun to decline, but still topped $45, 400. After six weeks, the amount had leveled further, down to around $6, 500  —   less than in the previous weeks but nonetheless higher than the original figure. Still more promising, there was a   increase of the number of monthly donors signing up for repeated contributions, growing from 106 in August 2015 to 1, 061 in September 2015, with only . 02 percent of them opting out of the commitment by January 2016. From this, the study concluded, iconic photos may lead to some sustained commitment even beyond the immediate surge of donations. To learn more about how the photo powered our emotions, we spoke to the report’s lead researcher, Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon psychology professor and president of Decision Research, a nonprofit organization that studies human judgment,   and risk perception. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. How did you measure the emotional impact of this photo?  We looked at the number of Google searches for ”Syria” and ”refugees” and ”Aylan.” Before, there was very little interest in the Syrian refugee crisis. Afterward and for approximately the next month, the searches [for each of these terms] spiked. We also looked at donations to the Swedish Red Cross, which set up a fund specifically to aid the Syrian refugees. Not only did the photo wake people up to make an emotional connection to the situation in Syria. But where people had an avenue for action, like donating, they did. Why did this photo in particular carry such an impact? What is the psychology behind that? It is an open question why this photo among so many stands out. In my opinion, there are a number of things going on. One is that the child is very young, nicely dressed and looks like he could have been one of our own kids. Another is the situation: He is coming with his family seeking a new life, and they were so close yet not quite making it. That adds to the special story. Another element is that we don’t quite see his face, you see the side of his face, so you can project onto him the face of someone you know. You cannot distance yourself as easily. In your paper you mention other emblematic photos, like that of the naked    Vietnamese girl fleeing a Napalm attack. Is it easier to have empathy for one person who is suffering than to feel compassion for large numbers of people who are suffering?  It’s not that people are not compassionate. But that compassion has to be aroused, and the data shows that the photograph helped do that. In addition to the cognitive impact that [a humanitarian crisis] is happening, you have to [evoke] emotion and feeling. Emotion is a critical factor in helping us understand an event, and it is a motivator that impels action as opposed to just abstract thoughts. Writers know this [when they] impress upon us the importance of a larger issue by telling the story through the eyes of one individual. In other words, you can identify with an individual but not so easily with an abstract statistic? We call Aylan an ”identified individual victim.” It is similar to the way The Diary of Anne Frank and Eli Wiesel’s Night also helped galvanize attention to the Holocaust. Aylan’s photo provided a window of opportunity for individuals to give and to feel [empathy] for the situation, and that is good.",-0.5
"How a Sensational, Unverified Dossier Became a Crisis for Donald Trump - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   Seven months ago, a respected former British spy named Christopher Steele won a contract to build a file on Donald J. Trump’s ties to Russia. Last week, the explosive details  —   unsubstantiated accounts of frolics with prostitutes, real estate deals that were intended as bribes and coordination with Russian intelligence of the hacking of Democrats  —   were summarized for Mr. Trump in an appendix to a   intelligence report. The consequences have been incalculable and will play out long past Inauguration Day. Word of the summary, which was also given to President Obama and congressional leaders, leaked to CNN Tuesday, and the rest of the media followed with sensational reports. Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims Wednesday as a fabrication, a   smear concocted by “sick people. ” It has further undermined his relationship with the intelligence agencies and cast a shadow over the new administration. Late Wednesday night, after speaking with Mr. Trump, James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, issued a statement decrying leaks about the matter and saying of Mr. Steele’s dossier that the intelligence agencies have “not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable. ” Mr. Clapper suggested that intelligence officials had nonetheless shared it to give policy makers “the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security. ” Parts of the story remain out of reach  —   most critically the basic question of how much, if anything, in the dossier is true. But it is possible to piece together a rough narrative of what led to the current crisis, including lingering questions about the ties binding Mr. Trump and his team to Russia. The episode also offers a glimpse of the hidden side of presidential campaigns, involving private    looking for the worst they can find about the next American leader. The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate’s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear. Fusion GPS, headed by a former Wall Street Journal journalist known for his dogged reporting, Glenn Simpson, most often works for business clients. But in presidential elections, the firm is sometimes hired by candidates, party organizations or donors to do political “oppo” work  —   shorthand for opposition research  —   on the side. It is routine work and ordinarily involves creating a big, searchable database of public information: past news reports, documents from lawsuits and other relevant data. For months, Fusion GPS gathered the documents and put together the files from Mr. Trump’s past in business and entertainment, a rich target. After Mr. Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee in the spring, the Republican interest in financing the effort ended. But Democratic supporters of Hillary Clinton were very interested, and Fusion GPS kept doing the same deep dives, but on behalf of new clients. In June, the tenor of the effort suddenly changed. The Washington Post reported that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, apparently by Russian government agents, and a mysterious figure calling himself “Guccifer 2. 0” began to publish the stolen documents online. Mr. Simpson hired Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer with whom he had worked before. Mr. Steele, in his early 50s, had served undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s and later was the top expert on Russia at the London headquarters of Britain’s spy service, MI6. When he stepped down in 2009, he started his own commercial intelligence firm, Orbis Business Intelligence. The former journalist and the former spy, according to people who know them, had similarly dark views of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a former K. G. B. officer, and the varied tactics he and his intelligence operatives used to smear, blackmail or bribe their targets. As a former spy who had carried out espionage inside Russia, Mr. Steele was in no position to travel to Moscow to study Mr. Trump’s connections there. Instead, he hired native Russian speakers to call informants inside Russia and made surreptitious contact with his own connections in the country as well. Mr. Steele wrote up his findings in a series of memos, each a few pages long, that he began to deliver to Fusion GPS in June and continued at least until December. By then, the election was over, and neither Mr. Steele nor Mr. Simpson was being paid by a client, but they did not stop what they believed to be very important work. (Mr. Simpson declined to comment for this article, and Mr. Steele did not immediately reply to a request for comment.) The memos described two different Russian operations. The first was a yearslong effort to find a way to influence Mr. Trump, perhaps because he had contacts with Russian oligarchs whom Mr. Putin wanted to keep track of. According to Mr. Steele’s memos, it used an array of familiar tactics: the gathering of “kompromat,” compromising material such as alleged tapes of Mr. Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, and proposals for business deals attractive to Mr. Trump. The goal would probably never have been to make Mr. Trump a knowing agent of Russia, but to make him a source who might provide information to friendly Russian contacts. But if Mr. Putin and his agents wanted to entangle Mr. Trump using business deals, they did not do it very successfully. Mr. Trump has said he has no major properties there, though one of his sons said at a real estate conference in 2008 that “a lot of money” was “pouring in from Russia. ” The second Russian operation described was recent: a series of contacts with Mr. Trump’s representatives during the campaign, in part to discuss the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. According to Mr. Steele’s sources, it involved, among other things, a   meeting in Prague between Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and Oleg Solodukhin, a Russian official who works for Rossotrudnichestvo, an organization that promotes Russia’s interests abroad. By all accounts, Mr. Steele has an excellent reputation with American and British intelligence colleagues and had done work for the F. B. I. on the investigation of bribery at FIFA, soccer’s global governing body. Colleagues say he was acutely aware of the danger he and his associates were being fed Russian disinformation. Russian intelligence had mounted a complex hacking operation to damage Mrs. Clinton, and a similar operation against Mr. Trump was possible. But much of what he was told, and passed on to Fusion GPS, was very difficult to check. And some of the claims that can be checked seem problematic. Mr. Cohen, for instance, said on Twitter on Tuesday night that he has never been in Prague Mr. Solodukhin, his purported Russian contact, denied in a telephone interview that he had ever met Mr. Cohen or anyone associated with Mr. Trump. The   on Wednesday cited news reports that a different Michael Cohen with no Trump ties may have visited Prague and that the two Cohens might have been mixed up in Mr. Steele’s reports. But word of a dossier had begun to spread through political circles. Rick Wilson, a Republican political operative who was working for a super PAC supporting Marco Rubio, said he heard about it in July, when an investigative reporter for a major news network called him to ask what he knew. By early fall, some of Mr. Steele’s memos had been given to the F. B. I. which was already investigating Mr. Trump’s Russian ties, and to journalists. An MI6 official, whose job does not permit him to be quoted by name, said that in late summer or early fall, Mr. Steele also passed the reports he had prepared on Mr. Trump and Russia to British intelligence. Mr. Steele was concerned about what he was hearing about Mr. Trump, and he thought that the information should not be solely in the hands of people looking to win a political contest. After the election, the memos, still being supplemented by his inquiries, became one of Washington’s   secrets, as reporters  —   including from The New York Times  —   scrambled to confirm or disprove them. Word also reached Capitol Hill. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, heard about the dossier and obtained a copy in December from David J. Kramer, a former top State Department official who works for the McCain Institute at Arizona State University. Mr. McCain passed the information to James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director. Remarkably for Washington, many reporters for competing news organizations had the salacious and damning memos, but they did not leak, because their contents could not be confirmed. (Mother Jones magazine was an exception, publishing a story on Oct. 31 that described the dossier, its origin and significance, while omitting the titillating details.) That changed only this week, after the heads of the C. I. A. the F. B. I. and the National Security Agency added a summary of the memos, along with information gathered from other intelligence sources, to their report on the Russian cyberattack on the election. Now, after the most contentious of elections, Americans are divided and confused about what to believe about the incoming president. And there is no prospect soon for full clarity on the veracity of the claims made against him. “It is a remarkable moment in history,” said Mr. Wilson, the Florida political operative. “What world did I wake up in?”",-1.0
"Prosecutors seek death penalty for 2 suspects in doctor’s murder, including her husband.  Prosecutors in the murder case of a beloved Florida doctor announced Wednesday they plan to seek the death penalty for two suspects in her gruesome killing, including her husband. State to seek death penalty for Mark Sievers and Jimmy Ray Rodgers in Teresa Sievers murder case. pic. twitter.  Teresa Sievers, 46, a holistic physician and mother of two, was found bludgeoned to death in the kitchen of her Bonita Springs home last June. Investigators recovered a hammer with blood and hair on it nearby. The doctor reportedly had returned home early from a vacation in Connecticut, leaving her husband and children behind to go to work. Prosecutors initially filed murder charges against two men from Missouri: a friend of Sievers’ husband and a man spotted at a Fort Myers Walmart near the Sievers’ home the day before the doctor’s body was found. However, in December, investigators announced a stunning twist in the case. They said Sievers’ husband, Mark, orchestrated the attack to cash in on insurance policies, and promised the two Missouri men a chunk of the $4. 4 million payout. Police had arrested the first two suspects,    Jimmy Rodgers and    Curtis Wayne Wright, in August. Mark Sievers, 48, tried collecting the insurance weeks before those arrests, The   reported. The insurance company, Ohio National Life, refused to pay him citing the criminal investigation. Wright pleaded guilty to   murder in February in exchange for a   prison sentence. He agreed to help prosecutors in their case against Mark Sievers, the newspaper added. The state also took custody of the children  —   ages 9 and 11  —   in February. After prosecutors announced they intended to seek the death penalty against Sievers and Rodgers, the husband’s defense attorney Antonio Faga responded, “We are not surprised that the state has taken this position, however we feel it is not an accurate position based upon the fact Mr. Sievers is innocent. ” There was no immediate response from Rodgers’ attorney.",1.0

"What Kenny Baker (and R2-D2) meant to us.  (CNN) Kenny Baker is dead. Long live  . Or is it    ? And are there supposed to be dashes? Never mind. The point being made here is that while one laments Baker’s death at 81 after what sources characterize as a ”long illness,” nothing whatsoever has happened to the brave and doughty little ”droid” that saved galaxies, repaired starships and helped guide a hero on his   path towards Enlightenment.  Somehow, you can be sure, he will go on. Still, one can share the desolation so many are feeling with Baker’s loss. Knowing there was an actual human being inside that beeping, whirring contraption somehow made the character    and, yes, he most certainly IS a character, as others in the movies keep insisting     seem even more companionable and inspiring. Underline ”companionable.” For at least a couple of generations, Baker and his alter ego had become confidantes, family friends, good luck charms and, yes, role models.  Cynics may scoff and puzzle over how children grow up attached to toy models created and sold off    franchises.  They don’t understand and never will. And yet, these same skeptics will likely feel their eyes get moist when they say goodbye to a car they’ve owned for 20 years. Or feel their hearts swell when they gaze at an ancient airplane that once carried a man alone across the continent where no one flew before. Admit it. You do, too, get sentimental about machines and, if in the proper mood, can even get mushy about imaginary machines with minds of their own who love and care for the people who need them.  That’s what   meant to the kids who eventually grew up and took their kids to see him reboot the Millennium Falcon and cheep like a parakeet when his Master Luke Skywalker saved the galaxy. Making it all the more gratifying was the knowledge that Baker in real life was also generous and brave the former, in his charitable activities for children, the latter in being able to wear that metal can in all manner of weather and come through as the megastar nobody saw, but fans all over the world recognized.

"German Lawyers File Lawsuit Against Mark Zuckerberg over ’Hate Speech’ Against Migrants - Breitbart. Despite grovelling efforts by Facebook to appease Germany over “online hate speech” against migrants, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is being taken to court in the country. A €150m lawsuit recently filed by two German lawyers accuses Zuckerberg and Facebook of violating the country’s   and   speech laws. [As we’ve previously reported at Breitbart Tech, Zuckerberg has made repeated attempts to appease the Germans on hate speech. The CEO personally visited Germany this month to insist that hate speech has “no place” on his platform and was previously caught on tape assuring German chancellor Angela Merkel that Facebook would “work” on the problem.  During his visit to Germany, Zuckerberg also promised to have “no tolerance” for “hate speech against migrants. ”  Facebook has even launched a €1 million initiative to tackle “hate speech” on social media, which they will run alongside European NGOs to “thwart xenophobia. ” Yet their efforts have failed at thwarting another hostile force: activist German lawyers, who are determined to prosecute Zuckerberg for failing to censor his platform fast enough. Cologne attorney Christian Solmecke and   lawyer Chan   recently filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg for violating Germany’s laws against inciting hatred and displaying Nazi symbols in the country. They argue that such material can still be found on the German version of Facebook. If convicted, Zuckerberg would face a €150 million fine. Solmecke and Jun have also filed a suit against Martin Ott, Facebook’s executive for northern, central, and eastern Europe. According to Vice News, who interviewed the lawyers, Jun has assembled a list of “more than 300 Facebook pages and posts that contain swastikas and other   images” as well as “calls for violence” against recent migrants to Germany. “I think Facebook has changed German society  —   not for the good,” Jun told Vice. “The complaints created an awareness that what Facebook is doing is not just a social problem but a legal problem. I’m glad to be part of that. ” Facebook’s rules already innclude   bans on anything that looks remotely like hate speech, as well as a host of minor offences like “bullying. ” Yet Jun and Solmecke still believe the company can do more to enforce their rules. European authorities are currently engaged in an extensive crackdown against alleged “hate speech” on the internet, as a wave of popular anger over European elites’ failed immigration policies threatens to overturn the current political consensus. Police in the Netherlands are threatening citizens who are   of European immigration policies online, while a man in Scotland was recently arrested for alleged “hate speech” against migrants on Facebook.

"Trump Takes Aim At Dodd-Frank, Investor Protections Rule In Executive Action. President Trump signed two directives on Friday, ordering a review of financial industry regulations known as   and halting implementation of a rule that requires financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Trump himself made his intentions clear in a meeting with small business owners Monday. ”  is a disaster,” Trump said. ”We’re going to be doing a big number on  .” These executive actions are the start of a Trump administration effort to reverse or revise financial regulations put in place by the Obama administration and seen by Trump and his advisers as onerous and ineffective. Based on the description given by the administration official who briefed reporters, the directives the president is expected to sign Friday won’t immediately do a big number on the law. The directive will instruct the Treasury secretary to meet with the agencies that oversee the law to identify possible changes. ”Americans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we’re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year,” said National Economic Council director Gary Cohn in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Cohn, who was president and COO at the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs before joining the administration, added, ”The banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers.” The president of the nonprofit Wall Street watchdog Better Markets issued a statement blasting Friday’s actions. ”The American people trusted candidate Trump when he said he was going to protect them from Wall Street’s recklessness, but President Trump has betrayed that trust,” Dennis Kelleher’s statement says. ”He is unleashing Wall Street on Main Street, which is exactly what the financial protections of Dodd Frank were put in place to prevent.” Hinting at where the administration might expect the review to lead, the official said that under the Obama administration, ”some of the rules may have even been unconstitutional, creating new agencies that don’t actually protect consumers.” That is an allusion to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog bureau which Republicans in Congress opposed from its very creation and was the subject of a   fight over its leadership and structure. ”This is not an attempt to undo ” the administration official insisted before going on to explain that some of the work of changing regulations, including the   Volcker Rule to mitigate risks, could be done through personnel, putting   people in charge at agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. It isn’t clear yet how long the review would take, but the official says every aspect of the law will be considered. A second directive would call on the Department of Labor to defer implementation of an   rule, known as the Fiduciary Rule, requiring financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients in retirement planning. The deadline for implementation was supposed to be April. Echoing arguments of the financial services industry, the Trump administration official said the rule would have unintended consequences if allowed to go forward. The industry says the rule will make it harder for advisers to serve   clients. Backers of the rule say it will prevent advisers from gouging customers by selling them inappropriate,   products. Once the review is complete, the official said, it’s possible the Labor Department could determine the rule is completely unnecessary. This rule has been heavily lobbied and some financial industry organizations had been pushing for the Trump administration to delay it. Key provisions of     passed in 2010, is made up of many provisions across many different regulatory agencies, some of which  —   like the Labor Department’s Fiduciary Rule  —   have yet to be implemented. The intent of the law was to implement comprehensive safeguards to monitor and regulate financial institutions so their potential failures would not pose a risk to the entire economy.   established some key new institutions and rules:",-0.5
"Dr. Zuhdi Jasser: Left Uses Muslims as ‘Foil for Identity Politics’. Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, strongly disputed accusations that President Trump’s immigration order contains a “religious test” or “bans Muslims. ”[“I don’t know where they’re getting that from,” he said. “I don’t think they read the same executive order. ”  “I served on the U. S. Commission on Religious Freedom for four years,” he pointed out. “We have an ambassador of religious freedom that goes around the world, trying to advance American values and protecting minorities. And it is extremely American, if not our first freedom, obviously, to protect religious freedom. That includes the persecution of minorities. ” “The executive order from President Trump said nothing specifically about any specific religion. It said we will protect those persecuted in the name of religion, for their religion. So that would include Christians, Yazidis, and even Sunni Muslims like myself who are part of the majority in Syria  —   or Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, or wherever  —   but yet have dissident opinions that are persecuted,” he pointed out. Jasser said it truly would be wrong to favor one religion over the other, “but it is very American to favor those who are persecuted over those who are the oppressors. ”  “And there’s nothing more American than vetting refugees, and beginning to vet them against those who believe in theocracy,” he added. “We don’t want people coming into this country that believe in the Islamic states. We want those who believe in freedom and liberty. I think it’s appropriate to pause and begin the process of vetting ideology, which hasn’t happened so far. We’re sort of welcoming in anyone, including jihadists. It’s just amazing how the identity Left loves to use us Muslims as a foil of identity politics. They’re really not addressing what was written in that order. ” Jasser said Trump’s order was, if anything, too narrow. “I think there should have been more countries: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar. The havens of the founding fathers of ISIS, I think, should have been included. But that would not make it more ‘ .’ There is nothing more   than helping dissident Muslims, helping those persecuted under theocracy, under the sharia state, if you will. ” He noted that the seven countries affected by Trump’s executive order are “the same seven countries that Obama listed as hot spots. ” “I will say, there should be some fair criticism about the messaging from the White House on this,” he added. “I understand why they rushed it: because they didn’t want people to get a head start, the radicals to get a head start. But still, probably the implementation could have been done better at the front lines, in airports, etc. But that’s a different criticism from having what I believe are   rallies across the country to try to undercut the stability of our country. ” Jasser said it was time to begin shifting “the axis of the conversation” about Islam and religious freedom. “The conversation for the last eight years, or even into the Bush administration, has been about ‘countering violent extremism,’ which is a tactic,” he said. “We need to start shifting to saying, ‘Well, what are we for?’ We’re against extremism. I think we should change it so that we’re against violent Islamism, so that we make it clear  —   because when you make it clear and identify the enemy as theocratic Islamists, then Americans can start to say, ‘Okay, so the   are our friends and allies, and the Islamists are our enemies.’ That makes it actually more   rather than creating this sort of generic phobia of, ‘Well, any Muslim could be a terrorist. ’” “That’s number one. Number two, we need to talk about what we’re for,” he continued. “We will advance those who want freedom and liberty, who believe in secular democracy. Our Muslim reform movement has a   declaration that is a declaration of principles, that says we’re against the Caliphate. We believe in the universal declaration of human rights. These are things that I’d like to see the President, as he has this   stay, start to engage. ” “He talks about a commission on radical Islamism. I hope he starts putting that into play because the pause is just going to be a pause, with nothing gained, if we don’t start to educate Americans about what we’re for, and what the sides are,” he warned. “The old allies in the Middle East  —   Saudi Arabia, etc.  —   they might be with us in this    program, but they’re both the firefighters and the arsonists. We need to make clear that our principles in America, our religious freedom, are not embodied in those countries that are the cauldrons of radical Islam,” he said. Jasser invited listeners to consult the resources at the American Islamic Forum for Democracy website and the larger umbrella Muslim Reform Movement that stretches across Europe and Canada.  “Unfortunately, the identity Left, and the Islamists who are what I call ‘’ have been dominating the conversation, and they’re just apoplectic right now because they’ve lost control,” he said.

As the ICE explained in its press release, “As a prior deportee,   was slated to have his removal order reinstated and be removed in 2015 after local criminal charges stemming from March 2014, against him were dismissed. At that time,   was released from local custody when Philadelphia authorities failed to honor an ICE detainer. He remained at large until his most recent arrest. ” Undeterred from Philadelphia’s past failure to honor federal immigration detainer against   ICE says it has filed another detainer “requesting he be safely transferred to ICE custody after the current local charges are resolved, to include any potential convictions and subsequent prison term. ” Cities and jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials  —   colloquially known as sanctuary cities  —   have come under fire following the high profile murder of Kathryn Steinle at the hands of a   illegal immigrant with a lengthy rap sheet. Philadelphia is considered a sanctuary city, incorporating policies that prohibit local law enforcement officials from honoring detainers or notifying immigration officials of upcoming releases of criminal illegal immigrants unless the offender has been convicted of a violent felony.",1.0
"HS Athlete Suspended for Tweet Slamming Rules Banning ’Scoreboard’ and ’Airball’ Chants - Breitbart. A Wisconsin high school suspended an athlete who posted a tweet criticizing new WIAA rules banning students from using certain words aimed at opposing teams in chants during games. [April Gehl, a student who plays three sports at Hilbert High School in Hilbert, Wisconsin, learned the hard way just how seriously authorities and school administrators take the new rules banning chants of words such as “airball” and “scoreboard” at school games.  School authorities suspended the student after they saw that she took to her Twitter account to criticize the new rules. Ghel’s post did contain an expletive as her tweet told the WIAA rules to “eat s**t. ” The teen soon took the tweet down but school administrators saw the it anyway, and handed down a   suspension for the “unsportsmanlike” language in her posting about unsportsmanlike language. The    student was totally surprised by the harsh   suspension after administrators noticed her tweet. “I couldn’t believe it,” Gehl told USA Today. “I was like, ‘Really? For tweeting my opinion?’ I thought it was ridiculous. ” USA Today columnist Ricardo Arguello says that a   suspension is an “over the top” penalty. In fact, as far as Arguello is concerned, students will “pick up on this perceived mishandling” of the situation and that will “make the respect demanded by school officials a bit more difficult to keep intact. ” The teen’s tweet comes on the heels of the announcement of new WIAA rules intended to put an end to chants that might hurt the feelings of players. The new rules ban chants such as “You can’t do that,” “Fundamentals,” “Air ball,” “There’s a net there,” “Sieve,” “We can’t hear you,” the “scoreboard” cheer, and “season’s over” during game play. WIAA sent an email to schools late last year informing them of the list of banned words and phrases, warning that violations of the ban would be met with penalties. The Ghel family reported that they don’t intend to appeal the suspension, but they still feel it is an absurd reaction to their daughter’s tweet. “Sure, what she said wasn’t the right words and wasn’t the best thing to do,” April’s mother Jill Gehl said. “I wasn’t real upset with her because there have been a lot more worse things said on Facebook and Twitter to specific people. This to me was more of a general response to an organization per se, not an individual. So, sure, I’m upset with it. But we just have to deal with the consequences. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com",1.0
"Anthony Bourdain: ‘I put aside my psychotic rage, after many years being awful to cooks’. I worked in a restaurant where the house speciality was mutton chops, so everything reeked of fat, penetrating every pore, follicle and piece of clothing, as if I’d been rolling around in sheep guts. It was the first thing I smelled in the morning and the last at night. But I didn’t have any friends outside the business. It’s one of the reasons chefs hang with each other  —   who else will love our smells? As a youngster, in New Jersey, I was fed normal pedestrian American home cooking  —   meatloaf and hamburgers  —   although I do recall a copy of Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking high up on the refrigerator and how on special nights, when guests visited and mysterious adult stuff went on downstairs, the powerful smell of scallops with mushrooms in white wine sauce (Coquilles St Jacques) drifted upstairs. At the age of nine, I went on the Queen Mary  —   being served vichyssoise, a word I loved  —   for my first trip to France, where boys were allowed   wine and cigarettes on Sundays. But our parents left me and my little brother in the car outside La Pyramide (in Vienne) while they dined inside. I reacted by requesting oysters and dishes they found repulsive and becoming increasingly adventurous in my tastes. It wasn’t about the food but about getting a reaction. I only became happy  —   in fact, intensely satisfied  —   as a dishwasher at a restaurant in Provincetown in Cape Cod, my first job. I was a shy, goofy, awkward teenager. But in this blue collar,   environment, there was no blurred line, no grey area, no philosophical question to fret over. Dishes had to go in the washer and come out taintless and doing this swiftly and competently meant I was acknowledged as a human being by colleagues I wanted to be like. The day they promoted me to dunking fries I was overjoyed.  It was watching chef Bobby screwing a bride over a barrel in the garbage area, while her wedding party dined inside, that made me want to be a chef. But it was awkward and didn’t make sense. It was the first time I’d seen anyone having sex and I didn’t understand the bride’s motivation. Although I understand it very well now. The line cook I especially respected was Beth Aretsky, aka “The Grill Bitch” a very sturdy, hard, capable, profane woman at a time when there weren’t many women in the kitchen. When a Moroccan chef felt her ass she grabbed and spun him, then   him brutally over a cutting board. Like many early women in the business she was twice as tough as the men. Despite how she bossed us, we’d go to her  —   often crying  —   for advice and support when having trouble with girlfriends. She wasn’t having any of that either. The crew at Mario’s restaurant spoke in this fantastic polyglot language incorporating Portuguese fishing dialect, Elizabethan poetry and Marine Corp profanities. And it was with Mario’s Dmitri  —   such an influence on my career  —   that I formed ‘Moonlight Menus’ and created elaborate banquets for pizza magnates and drug dealers. When Dmitri designed tableaus on the sides of hams he did so with a dry, fantastic, acidic and   wit. He made fun of his propensity towards failure and disappointment, often, but he was a very creative, skilled and bright guy, who was different than anybody else I’d met and very inspiring. Some of it was impressive for its time. I mean, no one else was doing pâté en croute and huge galantines in aspic, elaborate   presentations and   Carême and Auguste   set pieces in 1975. Nobody. (Although if Daniel Boulud, who’s since done these things, saw the quality I don’t think he would be dazzled or impressed by our technique, to put it kindly.) The mafia were everywhere back then. But now you have to look for them. The Racketeering  Corrupt Organisation Act  —   which meant any member of an organisation could be prosecuted for the same crime as the leader of that organisation  —   restricted the crime families’ involvement in the fish and meat markets. And we’re reaching the shallow end of the gene pool in a lot of these families  —   the sons are all cokeheads and don’t have the same values as their dads’. The restaurant world ain’t what it used to be. Steven Moore, my sous chef during the ‘90s, was the best one for practical jokes. If someone only put a potato in his shoe, he’d remove the door from their locker and fill it high with porn mags. (Sometimes he used to arrive at work with sperm on his shoes.) I still appreciate that he had no shame whatsoever  —   an admirable quality, of sorts. But I’ve no connection with him now, since it is my belief that he sold a dick pic of me to the gossip site TMZ. I’m proud that in the last few years as a professional chef, however upset I was with staff, we’d still be able to have a beer together at the end of the night, without  . I’d put aside my psychotic rage, after many years being awful to line cooks, abusive to waiters, bullying to dishwashers. It’s terrible  —   and    —   to make people feel idiots for working hard for you. Nowadays I still have a rather withering ability to be sarcastic and displeased but I’m not screaming at anyone. I was an unhappy soul, with a huge heroin and then crack problem. I hurt, disappointed and offended many, many, many people and I regret a lot. It’s a shame I have to live with. I like to hear music while I cook, but nothing too headbangy any more. Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye,   funk, Isaac Hayes and Brothers Johnson and I’m happy. If I examine my body now, nude in the mirror, there’s not too much damage to be seen. The burns, flesh marks and knife scars prevalent 14 years ago, before I moved into TV, have mostly faded. The damage sustained from handling lobsters and shrimp  —   the inflammations and skin rashes  —   have improved with time. My hands are pretty soft. My right hand is mangled with arthritis, from holding a whisk improperly for so many years, causing calluses to push bones out of joint. But I’m in much better shape than I’ve probably ever been. I travel 250 days a year. I’m lean, my alcohol bloat has gone and I do Brazilian   every day. As I get older my tastes become simpler. The foods that make me reliably happy, that have a real emotional appeal, are a simple bowl of regional pasta, spicy noodles sold in Vietnam, or anybody’s grandmother’s meatloaf. It’s a lethal error to always critically evaluate meals. I’ve certainly learnt to take food less seriously and try whenever possible to experience it emotionally rather than as a professional or critic. I like nothing more than seeing my daughter Ariane eating and liking food. When you’ve seen what I’ve seen on a regular basis it changes your world view. I’ve spent such a lot of time in the developing world, I was caught in a war in Beirut, been in Liberia, the Congo, Iraq and Libya and realised how fast things can get bad, how arbitrary good fortune and cruelty and death. I suppose I’ve learnt humility. Or something. The great Warren Zevon was asked, close to death, whether he had any important words of wisdom to pass on and he said, “Enjoy every sandwich. ” I definitely enjoy my sandwiches, given how low I fell and how likely it was that there was going to be a different and tragic outcome. I’m a pretty lucky man. I enjoy my food and presenting Parts Unknown. I have the best job in the world. • Appetites: A Cookbook by Anthony Bourdain is published by Bloomsbury (£26).

"The Unsolved Violence of Baton Rouge.    I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. BATON ROUGE, La. —  Two city police officers and one sheriff’s deputy were shot dead on Sunday in broad daylight in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three others were injured by gunfire, one critically. The gunman, identified in reports as Gavin Long of Missouri, was killed at the scene of the crime. Police have not confirmed his identity, and are not yet prepared to say whether he acted alone. What they have confirmed is that at 8:40 a. m. on Sunday, dispatchers received word of a man in black clothing carrying a rifle outside of a convenience store adjacent to a shopping center. Police spotted him almost immediately, and a “shots fired” call went out at 8:42. At 8:44, officers were reported down. Two minutes later, the gunman had moved to a neighboring carwash, and at 8:48, he was killed. The Investor Who Bought TrumpPence2016. com in April for $10, The slaying of three police officers did not happen in a “dangerous” part of town, where cops might go in expecting trouble. The shooting occurred next to a shopping center visited regularly by many people in the city. Hammond Aire Plaza is the same kind of    lot found in dozens of cities across the United States. Battered sedans and new SUVs sit    in the parking lot. There’s a Michaels craft store and a family shoe store that sells cheap    sneakers. There’s a grocery store and a Taco Bell. There are two car washes, both of which overdo it on the Armor All and try to upsell customers on   repair. Nearby, a Chili’s. Walgreens. Walmart.  Longtime residents will always describe the location as “where the old Blockbuster Video used to be. ” This is as ordinary a stretch of road as one might ever find in a   American city. It is now also the scene of a massacre. Baton Rouge isn’t a large city, though it has a large footprint: No two buildings are within walking distance. The city largely lacks sidewalks or pedestrian crossings to walk, here, is to place your life in the hands of texting motorists driving oversized cars and   pickup trucks. There are no bike lanes and no public transit systems, save a bus network that is unreliable, mired in scandal, and seemingly on the brink of collapse. If you live in Baton Rouge, you drive. Live here for a full year and you will spend just shy of two days —  47 hours —  sitting in traffic. If you can’t afford a car, you can’t go anywhere. This locks the poor into poverty: No job, no car no car, no job. Perhaps more significantly, it locks them into certain geographic areas, nearby and yet far out of view. Because the city is so spread out —  even a city as small as this —  when something significant happens a scant two miles away, it may seem to some to have happened in another country. The killing of Alton Sterling sparked a series of protests —  documented in video footage —  but in Baton Rouge, they didn’t make much of a mark, despite a week of    national coverage. The protests were largely limited to predominantly black, poor areas, which means their message was likely lost on the locals who most needed to hear it. I heard only one person bring the protests up at a coffee shop this weekend: “Are protests still going on?” she asked. “I might go to the library on Goodwood if not. ” All of this has made me acknowledge how little I really understand about the lives of people in this city, even though I’ve lived here for most of my life. What do I know about the life of a   officer? That week of images of Baton Rouge police in full body armor —  it was so needless, the armor, so obviously wrong, and yet, I didn’t really fault the police for the gear they wore. Five police officers in Dallas had been gunned down within days of Alton Sterling’s death. If I were a police officer with a family at home, I would have begged for protection. And anyway, Baton Rouge isn’t experienced in dealing with riots or heated protests it isn’t important enough to stoke such flames of passion on any topic. It often seems that nobody would notice if residents burned Baton Rouge to the ground. The police didn’t know what they were doing, and they were frightened. As we now know, they had a right to be. The next   bullets did, after all, have their names on them. * * * Before the death of Sterling and the protests that followed, there were signs that something was building in Baton Rouge. It felt as though tectonic plates were sliding against one another beneath our feet, and not smoothly. Journalists at The Advocate, the city newspaper, have reported diligently on issues of gross inequality. Consider the lack of   facilities in north Baton Rouge, a poorer part of town with a heavy black population. As a   measure in 2013, the Louisiana government closed the Earl K. Long Medical Center in that part of town. The state hospital had been treating the uninsured and the poor since 1968, often providing emergency care. The closure happened, but beyond selected press coverage, it didn’t seem to get much notice. North Baton Rouge also lacks commercial development. Despite recent years of brain drain, the city has had some economic success, spurred in part by a thriving film industry (that now seems set to pull up stakes) hotel construction, and major investments by such technology firms as IBM and EA Games. But little, if any, of that commercial success has been felt in north Baton Rouge. To the extent that lawmakers have tried to make progress in that area, it has largely been under protest, with no measurable gains to report. Even the proposed $100 million project to revitalize Baton Rouge’s zoo comes with a caveat: Move the facility out of north Baton Rouge to the affluent area south of Louisiana State University. In 2013, the unincorporated, financially thriving, southernmost part of East Baton Rouge Parish attempted to found a new city to exist alongside the city of Baton Rouge. Currently, many Baton Rouge residents don’t actually live in the city proper —  they live in “unincorporated areas” within the parish, basically indistinguishable from the sprawling city. Louisiana law allows these areas to organize as cities of their own, provided enough people sign a petition to get on the ballot. If this city, to be called St. George, were founded, 30 percent of the parish general fund would vanish, since wealthier citizens would now live in the new city.  It would all but but obliterate the financial   of the city of Baton Rouge, and north Baton Rouge in particular. The petition failed in 2015, falling a mere 71 votes shy of the needed 17, 859. Beneath the talk of better school districts and property taxes was a more provocative set of figures: At present, the city of Baton Rouge is 55 percent black and 40 percent white. The new city of St. George would have been 70 percent white, 23 percent black. Hard feelings and resentments brought out during that process have not dissipated. It was a relief that protests following Alton Sterling’s death did not devolve into riots. But they did expose seemingly intractable problems. The city is largely segregated —  if not racially, then certainly economically. Poor people have certain parks.   people have other parks.   people have country clubs. When a gunman shoots to death three   officers and wounds several others in a part of town visited by everyone, the unadorned reality of Baton Rouge is suddenly revealed for all. Here is your city. Here is the hatred. Here is the danger. Here are the problems unsolved.",-0.5
"What Obama Thinks of Islamism, Communism — and America. There has been quite a debate recently about President Obama’s understanding of Islamism, and his refusal to use terms such as “Islamist terrorism. ” But he has given us his view of another significant term: Communism. In one of his apparently innumerable conversations with The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, President Obama explained his view of Communism. To be fair, here is the full paragraph from Goldberg: In one conversation, parts of which I’ve previously recounted, Obama talked about the   confrontation between the U. S. and communism, and compared it to the current crisis. “You have some on the Republican side who will insist that what we need is the same moral clarity with respect to radical Islam” that Ronald Reagan had with communism, he said. “Except, of course, communism was not embedded in a whole bunch of cultures, communism wasn’t a   religion that was embraced by a whole host of good, decent,   people who are our allies. Communism for the most part was a foreign, abstract ideology that had been adopted by some nationalist figures, or those who were concerned about poverty and inequality in their countries but wasn’t organic to these cultures. ” Wow. First of all, by 1991 it is fair to say that Communism was indeed embedded in a “whole bunch” of cultures, to use the president’s phony populist phrasing. I am currently reading   Time, by Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, which in its description of the Soviet collapse brings out the voices of lots of former Soviet citizens who were born and raised in a culture in which Communism had been embedded. But that’s a minor point compared to the president’s assessment that Communism “was a foreign, abstract ideology that had been adopted by some nationalist figures, or those who were concerned about poverty and inequality in their countries. ” The notion that the Communist nomenklatura in Russia or Communist China or anywhere else was composed of people whose main goal was to eliminate poverty is bizarre and hopelessly wrong. Stalin and Mao were not motivated by reducing poverty they were concerned with seizing and keeping power. Mao put it pretty well: “Communism is not love. Communism is a hammer which we use to crush the enemy. ” As to nationalism, it’s hard to argue that Russian national power was Lenin’s key goal. It was a   to creating a   and   empire, the USSR, and for the expansion of Communism to Europe and then the Third World. Just as Iranian nationalism was not the key value for Khomeini (Shia Islam was) neither was Communism essentially a form of nationalism  —   nor was it adopted by leaders whose goal was national power. Rather, it was adopted by those whose goal was personal power. Communism was a theory that justified and excused them in demanding totalitarian power  —   in crushing enemies and outlawing opposition. Orwell once called Communism a form of power worship, and he was right. Is any of this a big deal? It is an interesting insight into how the president thinks about the 20th century. His apparent view that Communism was essentially a form of idealism, combining nationalism and the search for social improvement, is wrong. It makes one wonder about his view of the Cold War, the American role in defeating Communism, and, indeed, America’s global role yesterday and today. His Hiroshima speech began this way:   years ago, on a bright, cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed. A flash of light and a wall of fire destroyed a city and demonstrated that mankind possessed the means to destroy itself. Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima? We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in a not so distant past. The problem with these words is their utter lack of context: There is no mention of Japanese militarism and fascism, no attack on Pearl Harbor, no Bataan Death March, no Rape of Nanking. It seems as though on one “bright, cloudless morning,” the United States decided to obliterate Hiroshima. This is another insight into how the president thinks about America and the 20th century: We were not the people who saved the world from fascism and Communism, we were the people who opposed nationalism and equality  —   and who dropped the atomic bomb.,",1.0

"SpaceX aims to reuse a Falcon 9 booster used in January on June 17 – TechCrunch. SpaceX is hoping to return the Falcon 9 first stage booster used in its first flight back to active operations on January 14. That’s an impressive turn around time if they can pull it off – roughly six months. SpaceX has reused a Falcon 9 first stage just once, for its March 30 SES-10 mission. The turnaround for that rocket refurbishment took nearly a year, so under six months would be a drastic improvement, as it’ll halve the timeline of the previous effort. Eventually, SpaceX hopes to fly its Falcon 9 rockets again within 24 hours of use, so that it can pack as many launches as possible into as short a timeframe as possible, in order to maximize its launch capacity and achieve greater economies of scale.

"Turkey and Russia agree on draft Syria ceasefire, report says. Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Turkey and Russia have reportedly agreed on a draft nationwide ceasefire in Syria, the Turkish   news agency Anadolu said Wednesday. The report cited an unnamed source saying that Ankara and Moscow would try to bring a ceasefire into effect at midnight. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed that Turkey had prepared an agreement, Reuters reported, but it was not immediately clear if the Syrian rebel groups involved in the conflict were aware of the draft plan.  CNN has contacted all parties for comment. The Anadolu report said that unspecified ”terrorist organizations” would be excluded from the deal. In past agreements, ”terrorist organizations” have included ISIS and the    Jabhat  . Turkey also considers some Kurdish groups fighting in Syria terrorist groups, some of which have been armed and supported by the US. Washington describes those groups as moderate rebels. Moscow has not confirmed the deal, and when asked by journalists about it Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: ”I don’t have enough information.” Political negotiations? A successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms    forces from Iraq, Iran and Lebanon are also fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar  ’s regime. Some rebel groups have been openly armed and supported by the United States and Turkey, and sectarian divisions still run deep in Syria. Many attempts at ceasefires have crumbled over the years. If the ceasefire succeeds, the regime and the opposition parties will start political negotiations led by Turkey and Russia in the Kazakhstan capital, Astana, the Anadolu report said. Russia and Turkey are wielding increasing influence over Syria’s fate. Iran also expressed willingness to play a part in brokering a ceasefire last week in Moscow after talks with Russian and Turkish officials. The trio’s talks have sidelined the US, which has led an international coalition to fight ISIS in Syria and has vehemently opposed Assad remaining in power. A turning point, The   draft ceasefire comes six days after Syrian regime forces regained control of the key city of Aleppo    a major turning point in the country’s civil war that has raged for nearly six years and has killed an estimated 400, 000 people. Tens of thousands of civilians and rebels were evacuated from the city’s east under several deals brokered by Turkey and Russia. Rebels had held eastern Aleppo for more than four years, and losing the territory has made a military an political opposition to the Assad regime less likely, analysts have said. After the regime seized Aleppo, Russian President Vladimir Putin had said that a nationwide ceasefire was the next step in resolving the war. The UN Security Council has failed several times to find a political solution to end the brutal war. Russia shot down at least seven UN resolutions on Syria using its veto power as a permanent member of the Council. China vetoed six of those seven. Many of them were aimed at getting desperately needed aid into Aleppo. Turkey has insisted on playing a significant role in negotiations as it hopes to keep any territorial gains by Kurdish forces far from its border with the   country. Russia has been the closest and most powerful ally of Syrian President Bashar  . It has carried out airstrikes against rebel groups opposed to the leader’s regime since September 2015.",-1.0

Still, the most newsworthy change for this year’s awards comes in the most routine category: the acting trophies, which will no longer be split up on the basis of gender, but simply given to the “Best Actor in a Movie” and “Best Actor in a Show. ” “We have to constantly be pushing ourselves to not only respond to culture but lead it,” said MTV President Chris McCarthy in a CNN interview announcing the change. “If we’re going to do an award show that celebrates content, why would we not modernize what that looks like?” Though some might raise an eyebrow at the reduction of television and film to “content,” McCarthy said he was listening to MTV’s young audience in making the switch. “They don’t see those lines in the way that generations in the past have,” he said. “So we wanted to take those down. They felt really antiquated. ” What Moonlight’s Win Says About the Oscars’ Future, It’s a question that has come up for bigger awards ceremonies, too. The Billions star Asia Kate Dillon, who identifies as gender   recently sent a letter to the Television Academy questioning the   designations of the Emmys’ acting categories, unsure of whether to submit in Best Supporting Actor or Best Supporting Actress. The Academy immediately responded, noting that any actor can submit themselves in either category for any reason, and assuring Dillon that the Emmys do not enforce or investigate that choice in any way. “What I learned through my research is that the word ‘actor,’ specifically in reference to those who performed in plays, came about in the late 1500s as a   word,” Dillon said in an interview with Variety. “It applied to all people, regardless of anatomical sex or gender identity,” while “actress,” in origin, specifically refers to female performers. Though Dillon expressed great satisfaction at the Television Academy’s prompt response, the question of what “Best Actor” should mean in the 21st century remains a pertinent one. It’s fairly easy for the MTV Movie  TV Awards to do away with gender designations, because those nominees are decided by the show’s producers (though fans vote on the winners). This year’s movie category is equally balanced between male and female performers, with three apiece, while the TV category has four women and two men nominated (in “Best Comedic Performance,” however, five out of seven nominees are male, while there’s only one woman —  and one Demogorgon —  nominated as “Best Villain”). But what would be the impact if the Emmys, or the Academy Awards, totally did away with gender distinctions for its acting prizes (which, in both cases, have existed since their inception)? The Grammys long ago dropped this distinction (in 2011) but are helped by the fact that they hand out trophies to performers in 84 different categories. The Oscars only have four acting awards (lead and supporting, male and female) with five nominees for each category. In an industry still rife with institutional sexism, where male stars still dominate the amount of lead roles available, it’s easy to imagine wild gender imbalances from year to year, even if the lead and supporting categories were expanded to 10 nominees. Since the Oscars don’t provide statistics on votes for their nominees every year, there are few examples to go off. The Screen Actors Guild Awards do not use the term “actress,” but are still gendered, instead awarding trophies to the “Best Male Actor” and “Best Female Actor” in leading and supporting roles. A more useful example is the Television Critics Association, which gives awards for “individual achievement” in drama and comedy to one actor every year. The TCAs started handing out acting trophies in 1997, when Andre Braugher and David Hyde Pierce won for Homicide (drama) and Frasier (comedy) respectively. Since then, 15 of the 20 drama awards have gone to men (Edie Falco, Julianna Margulies, Claire Danes, Tatiana Maslany, and Sarah Paulson being the exceptions). The comedy category has been slightly more balanced, with only 13 out of 20 going to men. There have been signs of improvement in recent years —  women have won three out of the last five drama and comedy awards —  but the disparity is hard to ignore. The chances that the Oscars or Emmys would do away with gendered categories in the near future seem extremely remote. When handing your nominees to a large group of anonymous voters, it’s tough to exert much control over the outcome, and there’s the very real possibility that men would end up dominating the slates. If so, separate acting categories could perpetuate the simplistic idea that male performers are simply better than their female counterparts. But some might argue that   categories could be worth unbalanced nomination lists if they shed more light on Hollywood’s deeper systemic problems —  including far fewer speaking roles for actresses and the dearth of female directors. Whatever the big ceremonies decide to do, MTV’s rules change and critiques like Dillon’s suggest the issue will at least demand wider attention in coming years.

"RNC delegates launch ’Anybody but Trump’ drive. Washington (CNN) A coalition of Republican delegates is mounting a   effort to block Donald Trump from obtaining the GOP nomination by pushing for a ”conscience clause” that would allow delegates to vote against the presumptive nominee. Kendal Unruh, a Colorado delegate, organized a call with dozens of other delegates Thursday night to discuss ways to block Trump at the convention. The group, Unruh says, marks the coalescing of disparate ”pockets of resistance”    including backers of Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich    which had been opposing Trump with little success.  Priebus probes state GOP leaders over   push, ”This is a coalition of Kasich, Cruz and Rubio (supporters) and we are all agreeing on one goal, which is: Anybody but Trump,” Unruh said Friday.  The Washington Post first reported the details of the phone call. Any   effort would be nearly impossible to pull off at this point in the election cycle. But moves such as Thursday’s call demonstrate that Trump’s opponents inside the GOP are trying to organize more effectively. And, perhaps more importantly, it reflects the mounting anxiety inside the party about Trump’s candidacy amid polls that show him badly trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. His comments in the aftermath of the Orlando attacks    and his earlier criticism of a judge because of his Mexican heritage    have alarmed many in the GOP. Trump dismissed the effort Friday, suggesting it would be ”illegal” if the delegates tried to thwart the binding of the delegates.  ”I have tremendous support and get the biggest crowds by far and any such move would not only be totally illegal but also a rebuke of the millions of people who feel so strongly about what I am saying,” Trump said in a statement. ”People that I defeated soundly in the primaries will do anything to get a second shot    but there is no mechanism for it to happen.” The Republican National Committee, which has largely aligned with the Trump campaign, also dismissed the effort Friday. ”The extent of this effort is a bunch of random people tweeting about it, full stop,” said Sean Spicer, RNC chief strategist.  Later Friday, Spicer tweeted a short statement: ”Donald Trump bested 16 highly qualified candidates and received more primary votes than any candidate in Republican Party history. All of the discussion about the RNC Rules Committee acting to undermine the presumptive nominee is silly. There is no organized effort, strategy or leader of this   movement. It is nothing more than a media creation and a series of tweets.” How the GOP could cut ties with Donald Trump, Unruh, a member of the Republican convention Rules Committee, said she is lobbying others to sign on to her proposal. She would need 56 other supporters from the   panel, which will determine precisely how Republicans select their nominee in Cleveland.  The group, Unruh said, has dubbed itself ”Free the Delegates 2016”    a nod to another rules committee member, Curly Haugland, who has been arguing that delegates should not be forced to vote for Trump.  The renewed push to block Trump from securing the nomination comes after two incredibly choppy weeks for the presumptive nominee, following his comments on federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel and his promise to pursue a ban on Muslims entering the country in response to the Orlando terror attack. Steve Lonegan, a New Jersey Ted Cruz backer and former U. S. Senate candidate who was on the organizing call Thursday night, said that Republicans who do not believe Trump represents what the party stands for have a ”moral obligation” to stop him in Cleveland next month. ”I will tell you, about every two hours people contact me about how to join this effort,” said Lonegan said. ”This has never been done before, so there’s no textbook on how to do it. So we’re building an organic effort, state by state, to convince members of the Rules Committee to sign onto a rule that unbinds the delegates to vote their moral conscience.” Efforts to oust Trump in Cleveland appeared to ebb after Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol floated David French as his vaunted   option. But the movement to ouster Trump gained new steam after the fallout from the past two weeks.  A group of people    including Eric O’Keefe, a former top fundraiser for Cruz    recently formed a group they’re calling ”Delegates Unbound,” an effort to convince delegates that they have the authority and the ability to vote for whomever they want. A source working with the group told CNN that they are going to try to not only directly communicate with the delegates but also try to raise money to buy TV ads.  Unruh has moved out in front publicly on the issue, but   donors and operatives have been   their options for removing Trump behind the scenes as well. They come after efforts by top Republican donors and party leaders to tamp down Trump’s language appear to have failed. Unruh mocked those very efforts to rein in Trump, saying they would end up helping her cause. ”This will be an absolute success once that tranquilizer they sedated Trump with wears off,” Unruh said. Trump opponents have been getting some   cover as well. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Republicans who don’t want to support Trump by saying no one should betray their conscience. ”The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that’s contrary to their conscience,” Ryan told NBC’s Chuck Todd in an interview on ”Meet the Press” that will air Sunday. ”Of course I wouldn’t do that.”  As confusion continued to swirl about the pending nomination of Trump, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus announced Friday the selection of four party loyalists who will fill vital posts in the convention in Cleveland.  Priebus tapped RNC vice chairwoman Enid Mickelsen and former George W. Bush political director Ron Kaufman to   the convention Rules Committee. And he also tapped former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour    a trusted power player among establishment Republicans    to lead the convention’s Committee on Permanent Organization with Wisconsin RNC Committeewoman Mary Buestrin.

"Twitter company email addresses why it’s #BreakingMyTwitter – TechCrunch. It’s hard to be a fan of Twitter right now. The company is sticking up for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, when nearly all other platforms have given him the boot, it’s overrun with bots, and now it’s breaking users’ favorite third-party Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterific by shutting off APIs these apps relied on. Worse still, is that Twitter isn’t taking full responsibility for its decisions. In a company email it shared today, Twitter cited “technical and business constraints” that it can no longer ignore as being the reason behind the APIs’ shutdown. It said the clients relied on “legacy technology” that was still in a “beta state” after more than 9 years, and had to be killed “out of operational necessity.” This reads like passing the buck. Big time. It’s not as if there’s some other mysterious force that maintains Twitter’s API platform, and now poor ol’ Twitter is forced to shut down old technology because there’s simply no other recourse. No. Twitter, in fact, is the one responsible for its User Streams and Site Streams APIs – the APIs that serve the core functions of these now deprecated third-party Twitter clients. Twitter is the reason these APIs have been stuck in a beta state for nearly a decade. Twitter is the one that decided not to invest in supporting those legacy APIs, or shift them over to its new API platform. And Twitter is the one that decided to give up on some of its oldest and most avid fans – the power users and the developer community that met their needs – in hopes of shifting everyone over to its own first-party clients instead. The problem isn’t that the API is old and buggy (which it was), the problem is that the replacement API is unavailable. — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) August 16, 2018 The company even dismissed how important these users and developers have been to its community over the years, by citing the fact that the APIs it’s terminating – the ones that power Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Tweetings and Talon – are only used by “less than 1%” of Twitter developers. Burn! Way to kick a guy when he’s already down, Twitter. But just because a community is small in numbers, does not mean its voice is not powerful or its influence is not felt. Hence, the #BreakingMyTwitter hashtag, which Twitter claims to be watching “quite often.” The one where users are reminding Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about that time he apologized to Twitter developers for not listening to them, and acknowledged the fact they made Twitter what it is today. The time when he promised to do better. This is…not better: When I built our push notification server, I added the ability to send a message to every device in case of emergency. Today is the first time I’ve used it. pic.twitter.com/edgkver2Nh — Craig Hockenberry (@chockenberry) August 15, 2018 The company’s email also says it hopes to eventually learn “why people hire 3rd party clients over our own apps.” Its own apps? Oh, you mean like TweetDeck, the app Twitter acquired then shut down on Android, iPhone and Windows? The one it generally acted like it forgot it owned? Or maybe you mean Twitter for Mac (previously Tweetie, before its acquisition), the app it shut down this year, telling Mac users to just use the web instead? Or maybe you mean the nearly full slate of TV apps that Twitter decided no longer needed to exist? And Twitter wonders why users don’t want to use its own clients? Perhaps, users want a consistent experience – one that doesn’t involve a million inconsequential product changes like turning stars to hearts or changing the character counter to a circle. Maybe they appreciate the fact that the third parties seem to understand what Twitter is better than Twitter itself does: Twitter has always been about a real-time stream of information. It’s not meant to be another Facebook-style algorithmic News Feed. The third-party clients respect that. Twitter does not. Yesterday, the makers of Twitterific spoke to the API changes, noting that its app would no longer be able to stream tweets, send native push notifications, or be able to update its Today view, and that new tweets and DMs will be delayed. It recommended users download Twitter’s official mobile app for notifications going forward. In other words, while Twitterific will hang around in its broken state, its customers will now have to run two Twitter apps on their device – the official one to get their notifications, and the other because they prefer the experience. A guide to using Twitter’s app for notifications, from Iconfactory “We understand why Twitter feels the need to update its API endpoints,” explains Iconfactory co-founder Ged Maheux, whose company makes Twitterrific. “The spread of bots, spam and trolls by bad actors that exploit their systems is bad for the entire Twitterverse, we just wish they had offered an affordable way forward for the developers of smaller, third party apps like ours.” “Apps like the Iconfactory’s Twitterrific helped build Twitter’s brand, feature sets and even its terminology into what it is today. Our contributions were small to be sure, but real nonetheless. To be priced out of the future of Twitter after all of our history together is a tough pill to swallow for all of us,” he added. The question many users are now facing is what to do next? Continue to use now broken third-party apps? Move to an open platform like Mastodon? Switch to Twitter’s own clients, as it wants, where it plans to “experiment with showing alternative viewpoints” to pop people’s echo chambers…on a service that refuses to kick out people like Alex Jones? Or maybe it’s time to admit the open forum for everything that Twitter – and social media, really – has promised is failing? Maybe it’s time to close the apps – third-party and otherwise. Maybe it’s time to go dark. Get off the feeds. Take a break. Move on. The full email from Twitter is below: Hi team, Today, we’re publishing a blog post about our priorities for where we’re investing today in Twitter client experiences. I wanted to share some more with you about how we reached these decisions, and how we’re thinking about 3rd party clients specifically. First, some history: 3rd party clients have had a notable impact on the Twitter service and the products we build. Independent developers built the first Twitter client for Mac and the first native app for iPhone. These clients pioneered product features we all know and love about Twitter, like mute, the pull-to-refresh gesture, and more. We love that developers build experiences on our APIs to push our service, technology, and the public conversation forward. We deeply respect the time, energy, and passion they’ve put into building amazing things using Twitter. But we haven’t always done a good job of being straightforward with developers about the decisions we make regarding 3rd party clients. In 2011, we told developers (in an email) not to build apps that mimic the core Twitter experience. In 2012, we announced changes to our developer policies intended to make these limitations clearer by capping the number of users allowed for a 3rd party client. And, in the years following those announcements, we’ve told developers repeatedly that our roadmap for our APIs does not prioritize client use cases — even as we’ve continued to maintain a couple specific APIs used heavily by these clients and quietly granted user cap exceptions to the clients that needed them. It is now time to make the hard decision to end support for these legacy APIs — acknowledging that some aspects of these apps would be degraded as a result. Today, we are facing technical and business constraints we can’t ignore. The User Streams and Site Streams APIs that serve core functions of many of these clients have been in a “beta” state for more than 9 years, and are built on a technology stack we no longer support. We’re not changing our rules, or setting out to “kill” 3rd party clients; but we are killing, out of operational necessity, some of the legacy APIs that power some features of those clients. And it has not been a realistic option for us today to invest in building a totally new service to replace these APIs, which are used by less than 1% of Twitter developers. We’ve heard the feedback from our customers about the pain this causes. We check out #BreakingMyTwitter quite often and have spoken with many of the developers of major 3rd party clients to understand their needs and concerns. We’re committed to understanding why people hire 3rd party clients over our own apps. And we’re going to try to do better with communicating these changes honestly and clearly to developers. We have a lot of work to do. This change is a hard, but important step, towards doing it. Thank you for working with us to get there. Thanks, Rob",0.0

" Cuba Gets Ready To Bury Fidel Castro.  SANTIAGO DE CUBA, CUBA  —   Marta Jacobs Infante and her young daughter were among many in Santiago de Cuba anxiously awaiting the arrival of a military convoy carrying the ashes of Fidel Castro, their late president, on Saturday morning. “The death of Fidel is a very significative moment in the life of every Cuban person because he has been part of our history, of our development as a country,” said Jacobs Infante, 37, sitting on a   couch in her airy, sage green living room. Daniela, 6, sat eating a banana by her mother’s side. “He made a lot of good things for his people,” Jacobs Infante said. “I think every one of us has something to be grateful for. ” Castro’s ashes were scheduled to arrive in Santiago, the southeastern city where Fidel declared his socialist revolution was victorious in 1959, on Saturday afternoon after a   journey across the country from Havana, where he died at age 90 last weekend. His funeral is scheduled for Sunday morning following a gathering at Santiago’s Antonio Maceo Revolution Square the night before. Jacobs Infante said she was thankful to Castro for the fact that she was able to go to university for free and have a career as a teacher. Now she rents her home, nestled on a small street in central Santiago, to visitors. This weekend, a French journalist covering Castro’s funeral was staying with her. “We live in a free country,” she said. “We don’t have violence. Our children can live in our country without being in danger of being killed or kidnapped or anything like that. We are most of all free and we are most of all healthy and educated because of what he did. ” Castro implemented a socialist agenda that included greater access to education and health care, but he also clung to power for nearly 50 years, jailing political dissidents and stifling free speech. Some critics, including Cubans who have fled the country, celebrated his death. Many   took to the streets in Miami to herald the demise of the man they viewed as a dictator. “That’s politics,” Jacobs Infante said. “It’s true that maybe there are people that are not agree with the way he made socialism in Cuba. ” “I have the freedom to express myself because I don’t have the wrong expression, the wrong thoughts about the revolution,” she said. The country has been in an official state of mourning since Castro’s death. Freshly painted signs and greetings praising “el Commandante” can be seen along the roads where his ashes will pass. Cuban television has shown   coverage of the longtime president’s life, death, and voyage to his final resting place. The constant talk about Fidel, as he’s commonly referred to by Cubans, prompted a curious Daniela, who’s been asking about who he was and what’s happening, to write him a letter on Friday, her mother said. “Fidel, I love you with all my heart,” the letter read in Spanish. “Fidel, you are our commander in chief. ” Jacobs Infante said she and her neighbors would be going to watch the caravan pass through the city’s winding narrow roads. Daniela wore a red and black armband with “26 Julio” written on it, a reference to the day the Cuban revolution is said to have begun. “This is a historic moment,” Jacobs Infante said, smiling. “This is a moment that won’t be repeated in our history in a long time. So when I’m old, I will say to my grandchild, ‘I went there when Fidel died. ’”  ",-1.0
"Mosul offensive going faster than planned, Iraqi PM says.  The offensive to seize back Mosul from Islamic State is going faster than planned, Iraq’s prime minister said on Thursday, as Iraqi and Kurdish forces launched a new military operation to clear villages on the city’s outskirts. Howitzer and mortar fire started at dawn, hitting a group of villages held by Islamic State about   km (  miles) from Mosul, while helicopters flew overhead, according to Reuters reporters at two frontline locations north and east of Mosul. To the sound of machine gun fire and explosions, dozens of black Humvees of the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) mounted with machine guns, headed toward Bartella, an abandoned Christian village just east of Mosul. Militants were using suicide   roadside bombs and snipers to resist the attack, and were pounding surrounding areas with mortars, a CTS commander said. Hours later, the head of Iraq’s Special Forces, Lieutenant General Talib Shaghati, told reporters at a command center near the frontline that troops had surrounded Bartella and entered the center of the village. Two soldiers were hurt and none killed, and they had killed at least 15 militants, he said. ”After Bartella is Mosul, God willing.” A cloud of black smoke wreathed some frontline villages, probably caused by oil fires, a tactic the militants use to escape air surveillance.  Iraqi state TV later quoted a CTS spokesman as saying about 80 insurgents were killed in fighting in Bartella and 11 suicide   destroyed. A U. S. service member also died on Thursday from wounds sustained in an improvised explosive device blast in northern Iraq, the U. S.  military coalition said in a statement. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a U. S. defense official said the incident took place near Mosul. Roughly 5, 000 U. S. forces are in Iraq. More than 100 of them are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces involved with the Mosul offensive, advising commanders and helping them ensure coalition air power hits the right targets, officials say. The fighting around Mosul has also forced 5, 640 people to flee their homes in the last three days, mostly in the past 24 hours, the International Organization for Migration said on Thursday. MORE QUICKLY THAN WE THOUGHT Prime Minister Haidar   addressing   state coalition allies meeting in Paris by a video link, said: ”The forces are pushing toward the town more quickly than we thought and more quickly than we had programed.” Islamic State denied that government forces had advanced. Under the headline ”The crusade on Nineveh gets a lousy start,” the group’s weekly online magazine   said it repelled all assaults on all fronts, killing dozens in ambushes and suicide attacks and destroying dozens of vehicles including tanks. The U. S.  coalition that includes France, Italy, Britain, Canada and other Western nations is providing air and ground support to the forces that are closing in on the city in an operation that began on Monday.   Mosul is the last big stronghold held by Islamic State in Iraq and around five times the size of any other city the group has held. The push to capture it is expected to become the biggest battle fought in Iraq since the 2003 U. S.  invasion. The United Nations says Mosul could require the biggest humanitarian relief operation in the world, with   scenario forecasts of up to a million people being uprooted by the battle. About 1. 5 million residents are still believed to be inside the city, and Islamic State has a history of using civilians as human shields. French Foreign Minister   Ayrault said controls were being put in place to check jihadists were not trying to insert themselves among those fleeing Mosul. BOMBS, BUNKERS AND TUNNELS On the northern front, Kurdish peshmerga shot down a small drone that had flown over from the Islamic State lines. It was not clear if the drone, 1 to 2 meters (yards) wide, was carrying explosives or being used for reconnaissance. ”There have been times when they dropped explosives,” said Halgurd Hasan, one of the Kurdish fighters deployed in a position overlooking the plain north of Mosul. Ali Awni, a Kurdish officer, kept a handheld radio receiver open on a frequency used by Islamic State. ”They are giving targets for their mortars,” he said.   So far, advancing Kurdish troops have moved through villages outside the city, finding abandoned houses rigged with explosives and underground bunkers. In some cases fighters from Islamic State, known by opponents by the Arabic name of Daesh, appear to have fled without putting up a fight. ”We did not face resistance from Daesh. They are retreating to Mosul and to Syria. They gave no resistance,” peshmerga soldier Ahmed Midhat Abdullah told Reuters in the village of Nawaran, north of Mosul, where a Kurdish column of armored vehicles was advancing in the dusty desert terrain. Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, swept into Mosul and other parts of northern Iraq in 2014 and has used extreme violence to administer a   caliphate there and in parts of neighboring Syria. ”The objectives are to clear a number of nearby villages and secure control of strategic areas to further restrict ISIL’s movements,” the Kurdish general military command said in a statement announcing the launch of Thursday’s operations. SHI’ITE MILITIA The area around Mosul is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse parts of Iraq, and Western countries backing the assault are concerned that communities feel safe as the government forces advance, to avoid revenge attacks or ethnic and sectarian bloodletting as fighters are driven out.  Western allies have tried to limit the role of Shi’ite militia fighters known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, which human rights groups say have carried out killings and kidnappings of Sunnis in other areas freed from Islamic State. After the Paris meeting, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim   offered reassurance: ”In answer to those who criticize the PMF for behaving badly, this is not true . .. They are part of the Iraqi forces and will be disbanded afterwards.” Prime Minister Abadi said the Mosul advance demonstrated that Iraqis from all groups could fight in common cause, noting that it was the first time in 25 years that troops from the Baghdad government had entered territory controlled by the Kurdish region to fight alongside the peshmerga. ”Our war today in Mosul is an Iraqi war conducted by Iraqis for Iraqis and for the defense of Iraq’s territory,” he said. ”Full Iraqi unity is shining through and more than ever showing the unity to vanquish terrorism.”  U. S. President Barack Obama hopes to bolster his legacy by seizing back as much territory as he can from Islamic State before he leaves office in January. Islamic State ”will be defeated in Mosul” Obama said on Tuesday, expecting the fight to be difficult. Iraqi officials and residents of Mosul say Islamic State is preventing people from leaving the city, in effect using them as shields to complicate air strikes and the ground progress of attacking forces.

" Professor Who Asked For “Muscle” To Block Journalist Suspended After Assault Charge.  The Board of Curators said communications professor Melissa Click was suspended with pay until further investigation into her conduct was completed, the Columbia Daily Tribune reported.  On Monday, Click pleaded not guilty to assault charges filed by the Columbia, Missouri city prosecutor’s office for an incident during a   protest held on campus in November 2015. In a video of the protest held on a public area of campus, Click is heard asking for “some muscle” to kick out freelance student journalist Mark Schierbecker. “Hey, who wants to help me get this reporter out of here,” Click says in the footage. “I need some muscle over here. ” The Board of Curators met Wednesday for three hours in a closed meeting before announcing they voted to suspend Click, pending further investigation.  “The Board of Curators directs the general counsel or outside counsel selected by the general council to immediately conduct an investigation and to collaborate with the city attorney and promptly report back to the board so the board may determine whether additional discipline is appropriate,” said Pam Henrickson, the Board of Curators chairperson.

"Sainthood for Mother Teresa.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF Mother Teresa, the nun who devoted her life to working with sick and poor communities in India and elsewhere, was canonized as a saint on Sunday. Pope Francis declared sainthood for Teresa during a ceremony at the Vatican in front of tens of thousands of people. Her canonization comes a day before the anniversary of her death in 1997. “Her mission to the urban and existential peripheries remains for us today an eloquent witness to God’s closeness to the poorest of the poor,” the pope said. “Today, I pass on this emblematic figure of womanhood and of consecrated life to the whole world of volunteers: may she be your model of holiness. ” Here was the scene in St. Peter’s Square: Teresa will now be known as Saint Teresa of Kolkata. She was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje in   Macedonia in 1910 to Albanian parents. She is known for founding the religious order Missionaries of Charity in 1950, an organization of nuns that is now active in more than 100 countries and cares for the impoverished and the sick, particularly people with AIDS, and orphans and the elderly. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work. She died in 1997 at the age of 87. Saint Teresa joins about 10, 000 other official saints in the Catholic Church. Becoming a saint is not easy and can take decades, and the process for canonization usually begins five years after a candidate’s death. “Because she was so widely admired among the faithful, however, Pope John Paul II waived that traditional waiting period, allowing the process to begin only 18 months after her death in 1997,” explained Josh Ulick and Youjin Shin in The Wall Street Journal this week. To become a saint, one must, as my colleague Kathy Gilsinan outlined last year, “1. be dead 2. have demonstrated ‘heroic virtue’ while alive and 3. perform miracles posthumously. ” She continued: Modern miracles are mostly healings, and the Vatican reviews them with both doctors and theologians to make sure they are “complete,” “instantaneous,” “durable,” and inexplicable but for the intercession of the holy person. The Vatican acknowledged Teresa’s first miracle in 2003, after the nun was said to have cured a woman with tumors in Kolkata. Her second miracle, recognized in 2015, involved curing a man with multiple brain abscesses in Brazil. While many celebrated Teresa’s path to canonization, others believe some of her actions were less than saintly. NBC News’s Matt Bradley describes some of the criticism: In the eyes of some, particularly in India, she put fame and piety before her mission of aid. Among other critiques, she has been accused of offering stingy or substandard medical care of proselytizing to her patients of claiming virtue in suffering rather than trying to alleviate it cozying up to dictators and of promoting her efforts to a global media eager for heroes. The Vatican distributed 100, 000 tickets for Sunday’s canonization ceremony. The square was bursting with people, some waving the national flags of India, where Teresa arrived at 19 years old and where she would carry out most of her work.

"Argentina Reaches Settlement With Hedge Funds, Ending 15-Year Dispute. Argentina has reached an agreement with some of its creditors that should help end a long and acrimonious dispute that has blocked the country from the international bond markets. The deal, which must be approved by Argentina’s Congress, calls for the government to pay $4. 653 billion to four of the   holdout U. S. hedge funds. That equals about 75 percent of what they claimed they were owed. Argentina defaulted in 2001 and has been trying to restructure billions of dollars in debt, but a group of hedge funds, led by Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, refused to go along and sued that country’s government in U. S. federal court. U. S. District Judge Thomas Griesa subsequently issued an injunction barring Argentina from paying some of its creditors without also paying the holdouts, and the government went into default again in 2014. The legal fight wound up before the U. S. Supreme Court, which in 2014 upheld lower court rulings and essentially required Argentina to pay the holdouts. The court battle had lapsed into a bitter political fight, with former Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner labeling the holdouts ”vulture funds.” Meanwhile, Argentina was essentially blocked from borrowing any more money in the bond market. But everything changed after the November election of President Mauricio Macri, who vowed to end the dispute during his campaign. ”The current administration realized that Argentina cannot be shut down from the international markets, so from the beginning they said, ’We’re going to fix this problem,’ and that’s what they’re doing,” said Diego Ferro,   investment officer at Greylock Capital Management, in an interview with NPR. Earlier this month, Judge Griesa agreed to lift the injunction that blocked Argentina from paying its creditors. The settlement between Elliott Management and Argentina was announced this morning by Daniel A. Pollack, the special master appointed by the court to oversee settlement talks. The deal does not completely settle Argentina’s debt woes, since some smaller bondholders continue to resist restructuring, Ferro says. But they lack Elliott’s resources and constitute a smaller threat to the government. ”With the biggest, most sophisticated holdouts settled and dropping their claims, I think that Argentina should feel a lot more comfortable going into the markets,” said Anna Gelpern, a professor at Georgetown Law School and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics.",-0.5
"BloomReach wants to deliver meaningful data directly to online merchandizers – TechCrunch. BloomReach has always been about helping online retailers maximize their revenue algorithmically by adjusting content in an automated fashion based on what it knows about the visitor and his or her preferences. In the latest release announced today, the company builds on this by offering data and analytics to help human merchandizers make better daily decisions about how to optimize their product pages. The idea with the new version of BloomReach Compass, is to take data and integrate it into the lives of online merchandizers, giving them the data they need to do their jobs without going to a professional data team. In essence, this is about personalization, something that has been the holy grail of eCommerce and content management platforms for some time. BloomReach CEO, Raj De Datta says what separates his company from the rest of the marketing cloud pack is an emphasis on data science, and with this release, analytics personalized by merchandizing role. If you’re a merchandizer working for an online retailer, you have an infinite number of possibilities in terms of how to present your merchandize and get the buyer to keep going through the process to purchase. Most people rely on “gut” to make these decisions, or they are at the mercy of external data teams who are often removed from the business process and take time to present the information. BloomReach wants to leave it less to instinct (or external data teams) by giving merchandizers the information to make a decision based on data  — and putting that data in front of the right person at the right time. Image: BloomReach Image: BloomReach “We’re looking at all the data, figuring out the most important thing to prioritize based on big data, and giving [the merchandizer] suggestions. It will be very contextual to [their] jobs,” De Datta explained. Most merchandizing teams are trying to find trends they believe are happening or relying on that data team to tell them eventually, but what this product does is bring real data about what customers are looking at right now, what matters to them and perhaps most importantly, what to do take advantage of that. This should help merchandizers to prioritize products and make decisions based on real-time data when they get to their desks in the morning. “This process used to involve maintaining giant spreadsheets and good luck determining what to do next,” De Datta said. BloomReach want to build this information directly into the merchandizer’s daily workflow. It certainly sounds great on paper, and if it can truly give each merchandizer what they need to maximize the company’s sales, it will be one step to closer that personalization holy grail. BloomReach launched in 2009 and has raised $97 million to-date. The latest funding was a $56 million round in January of this year.",0.0

"Florida Parents to Carry Guns amid ’Creepy’ Clown Problem. Some Florida parents have made clear they will be responding to the “creepy” clown problem by carrying guns as they take their children   . [Florida Today (FT) quotes Brevard County’s Kimberly Kersey, who made clear her plans to be armed while she takes her sons through the neighborhood. She said, “I’ll be carrying for sure, I’m not leaving to chance. I’m terrified of clowns already and if one messes with me or my kids it’ll be to the hospital or morgue they go. ”  Titusville’s Pam Metz said, “Since I have no gun, I will be carrying a bat around on Halloween night. ” The decision to arm up comes in response to clown suspects terrorizing people in Brevard County. An incident reported on October 15 entailed “someone disguised as a clown in north Melbourne threatening victims with a large bat, stick or ax. ” The suspect allegedly confronted people, then charged at them and threatened to kill them. Police were called for a clown acting similarly on October 20. In both instances, the suspect( s) fled the scene before officers arrived. FT stresses that the two October incidents were only the latest in a string of others: Fox   reports that some Brevard County law enforcement personnel are worried that people who innocently dress as clowns Monday night might get hurt. Palm Bay police Lt. Mike Banish said, “The problem is that someone dressed like a clown could scare someone and there’s a possibility, a possibility you could end up with someone getting shot.

"Talking innovation in a data-enabled economy with Secretary Penny Pritzker – TechCrunch. Shelly Kapoor Collins
Contributor



		Shelly Kapoor Collins is founder of Shatter Capital, a data driven funding platform where female entrepreneurs and investors meet to accelerate innovation. Since his first day in office it has been a key priority for President Obama and his Administration to deliver an open and transparent government to better serve the people. And the leadership at the US Department of Commerce has been working hard to lay the foundation for that transparency in a way that will enable a strong digital economy to endure well past this Administration and benefit American competitiveness for generations to come — with the help of government data. Indeed, the open data that is being released by the Federal Government and particularly by the Department of Commerce is a key asset that is enabling both transparency and business opportunities across industries. During her visit to Silicon Valley last week US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker wanted the tech community to know that the Department of Commerce is its partner in driving innovations, growing the American economy and opportunities for American workers, made possible by the value of open data. Known as “America’s Data Agency”, the US Department of Commerce is one of the largest publishers of open data from across its twelve bureaus. The breadth and depth of data that Commerce provides is vast ranging from weather forecasts to economic data that are important for key business decisions such as where to locate, where to manufacture a product and where to sell that product. The value of this data can translate to tens of billion dollars for the American economy on an annual basis. Indeed, according to the Open Data 500 Study, the first comprehensive study of its kind, there are in excess of 500 companies that use open government data to fuel innovative businesses in agriculture, finance, energy, education, healthcare, and many other sectors of the economy. The efforts of Secretary Pritzker and her team go well beyond releasing data, though. The Secretary stressed that there must also be collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors, standardization and timely accessibility of the data in order to drive maximum value to the business community. She further highlighted that the government is here to serve its key customer, the public, and that the technology community should view the Commerce Department as its partner. “I want there to be a recognition in the tech community that the Department of Commerce is your partner when it comes to data and the digital economy,” the Secretary said. And, indeed, the private sector has embraced working with the Commerce Department. “We have created the Commerce Data Advisory Council which consists of a group of professionals that act like a public company’s board of trustees to help identify the priorities for our department including high level Technology executives such as Intel’s Chief Information Officer, Paypal’s Head of Data Strategy, and IBM’s Chief Information Strategist,” said Secretary Pritzker. The startup community isn’t ignorant of the benefits of working with the Commerce Department, either. Startups that met with Secretary Pritzker during her visit included Omnity which uses data from the USPTO, BrightBtyes which looks at Census data, Symbiotic Technology and Ecology (STAE), AutoGrid which leverages data releated by NOAA and Arborlight, also relying on data from NOAA. There is a transformation of the Federal Government underway which goes beyond the modernization of systems being used across the government. It also involves a shift in how government leaders such as Secretary Pritzker, a former CEO herself, are seeking to incorporate private sector best practices and business models. To learn more about how Secretary Pritzker and her team are engaging with the private sector to drive innovation and opportunities to benefit not just the Department of Commerce but commerce overall, listen to the entire interview, Talking Innovation through Open Data with Secretary Penny Pritzker.",0.0
"When College Students Need Food Pantries More Than Textbooks. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. As a more racially and socioeconomically diverse body of students pursues college in the United States, schools find themselves responding to more requests to stock food pantries and hand out vouchers for supplies at campus bookstores. Universities have different reasons for offering students emergency help when things go wrong unexpectedly. Some of them are humanitarian. But, as a new report from NASPA: Student Affairs Professionals in Higher Education points out, many colleges are creating   programs in part to increase graduation rates, particularly among     students, and students of color, who make up a growing number of college goers but often drop out at higher rates than their white and affluent peers. NASPA looked at 523 schools across various sectors of the   landscape —  public and private,   and   colleges —  surveying vice presidents for student affairs and   directors. While nearly 75 percent of respondents said their school had some sort of   program, most also said that need outpaces resources, and few actually use data to figure out which students are most at risk of quitting, in part because they’re already overwhelmed by requests. The report found that many universities have been offering emergency aid to students at risk of dropping out for financial reasons for years, but often in an ad hoc fashion. Requests for help might be handled by one department on Monday, another department on Thursday. And students usually figure out where to go by asking other students or professors. NASPA attempted to take stock of where these programs exist, how they operate, and, perhaps more importantly, how they might streamline services for students. Amelia Parnell, one of the authors of the report, said that although emergencies are not new, the cost of education is rising, and calls for certain types of aid, such as food pantries, seem to be increasing. “I don’t think we had that type of situation 10 years ago,” she said. Only about 60 percent of students who begin college have a degree six years later, but figures are even lower for black and Latino students, who are more likely to be  . While some of the attrition is tied to academic issues, a good portion is financial. Where students can apply for aid and scholarships to cover tuition and housing, in the absence of similar assistance to cover unforeseen family emergencies or medical issues, students who don’t have savings can be forced to drop out. In addition to food pantries and vouchers, schools are also turning to completion grants to help students who run out of money and other   options in their last semester or year of school. A separate study from the Association of Public and   Universities (APLU) found that most of the schools it looked at turned to the grants after they noticed rising dropout rates among students close to graduating. Georgia State University in Atlanta launched a   program in 2011 after discovering that many seniors needed just a few hundred dollars. Dillard University, a historically black college in New Orleans, created a fund two years ago after the school discovered it was losing more students to financial gaps than academic issues, Marc Barnes, the vice president for institutional advancement, said. Dillard put out a call to alumni and raised several hundred thousand dollars in the first few months, and $1. 5 million in the last two years. The school has assisted about 250 students, a sizeable figure considering the entire student body is about 1, 200. “It’s made a significant difference,” Barnes said, adding that retention rates are up several points. Like Georgia State, Dillard attaches some strings to the aid. The school requires students to be in good academic standing and to take a   course. They also have to participate in a university event. The school doesn’t advertise the program, but, Barnes said, it’s also not a   secret. Barnes expects need at Dillard to increase because of looming cuts to a Louisiana scholarship that helps thousands of   students pay for college. But need could also grow nationally, too. At Dillard, where more than 40 percent of students are     and some 90 percent rely on financial aid, administrators have been helping students who have financial emergencies for years, offering food and clothes, and even helping homeless students secure housing. Other schools are just learning what it takes to help such students succeed, Barnes said, noting that his school accepts transfer students from colleges they say aren’t as receptive to their   needs. “It’s a learning curve for both the students and the institutions,” he said, adding that Dillard “gets a number of calls” from other colleges considering   funds. The NASPA report notes that several states, including Wisconsin and California, have recently considered allocating   funding for colleges. And as more emphasis is placed on graduation rates and   rates, more schools may look to such funds to increase retention. The report offers a series of recommendations for how schools should proceed, including standardizing aid programs to create consistency in terms of who can access aid and how it’s distributed, automating aid processing, and using data to evaluate how effective programs are. Barnes said one school she surveyed looked at how students paid tuition if a student typically paid by check and suddenly switched to credit, the school would reach out to see if the student was struggling. But some schools are reluctant to move that direction. Schools are concerned that clarifying and advertising emergency aid will overwhelm their resources, and others worry about facing increased scrutiny over how they administer emergency aid if programs balloon. Yet, the APLU noted, “A culture of success means institutions must be willing to find new ways of educating, empowering, and supporting students so they thrive and achieve their goals. In turn, to foster a culture of student success, an institution must also embrace a culture of innovation where it is acceptable to take calculated risks. ” As Cedric Howard of the University of Washington Tacoma said in the report, “You can’t have intervention without promoting and celebrating risk   …     if you think you’re going to be innovative and that you’re going to be very risk averse, it’s not going to work very well. ”",-0.5
"A clash of identities.  (CNN) This election was not easy for me. The 2016 campaign challenged me to figure out how to do my job as a journalist while remaining unbiased    even as my own people were regularly berated by the candidate who ultimately won. It tested the very core of who I am and what kind of legacy I want to leave as the   daughter of two hardworking and humble Mexican immigrants. I became a journalist to make a difference in this changing world. I am not a Democrat or a Republican I am a reporter who strives to write honestly and fairly about candidates and officeholders. But when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants ”rapists” and ”criminals,” adding that he assumed ”some are good people,” those remarks resonated with my community    and with me. The immigrants I know are honest and industrious. My parents came to the United States to create a better life for their children. And they were successful: My three siblings and I are     who are working to make this country a better place. Still, I had a job to do. I could not    would not    take sides. I reported on Trump for a year and a half, and I did so fairly, in the nonpartisan manner that my profession demands. There were many days when I struggled to shut off my cultural identity so that I could focus on my job. There were days when I wanted to exclaim to whomever would listen that   are people, too    people who contribute to this country, who become citizens and vote in this country, and who matter to this country as much as any other group. There were times when I doubted that my work was improving the perception many in this country have of Latinos. I wasn’t the only reporter to be tested by this election. It wasn’t easy for my colleagues who are     and even women    members of groups that Trump offended repeatedly during the race. But at one point during the campaign    near my breaking point    I had a tender conversation with my mother while visiting my parents’ home in McAllen, Texas, on the South Texas border: ”Mijita, tienes que seguir tu lucha, (My little daughter, you need to continue your fight),” my mother told me. ”¿Por qué? (Why? )” I asked, downcast by the barrage of negative rhetoric on the campaign trail. ”Por que si tu no lo haces, nadie lo va hacer, (Because if you don’t do it, nobody will),” she told me. And with that, she reminded me why I woke up every day, why I faced this responsibility  . I don’t regret taking this job to cover the 2016 election. In fact, it’s been the best decision I’ve ever made. And now that Trump is going to be the president, I look forward to covering him as a political reporter these next four years. Because one of the most important components of a functioning government is a strong Fourth Estate    the freedom of the press. That freedom is one that I wouldn’t have if I were a reporter in another country, even the one directly south of the border. And it’s that freedom and others that make America exceptional. It’s one of the reasons  my parents chose to make this country their home, and why I’m proud to call it my own.",-1.0
"Trump-Modern Day Paul Revere Deserves Nobel Peace Prize - Breitbart. Give that man a Nobel Peace Prize! [Donald Trump  —   the modern day Paul Revere  —   rocked the political world when he jumped into the race last year warning about the invasion across America’s southern border that politicians in both parties had been desperately trying to cover up for years. Actually, Revere did not have it nearly so hard as Mr. Trump, who was branded a bigot and a racist and   for simply arguing that America should enforce our duly enacted immigration laws and secure our border.  Mr. Trump stuck with the issue and rode it all the way to the Republican nomination. Granted, Mr. Trump always does things his own way. Such as when he celebrated Cinco de Mayo by posing for picture eating a taco bowl from Trump Tower, giving a   and pronouncing: “I love Hispanics!” Not exactly a campaign strategy taught at the Georgetown University for Politicians. Call it Taco Bowl Diplomacy. But, apparently, it works! Mr. Trump swooped into Mexico City on short notice Wednesday to meet with Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, who has compared Mr. Trump to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Pena Nieto left the private meeting saying he is “certain” thatMr. Trump’s “genuine interest is to build a relationship that might lead us to provide both our societies better conditions. ” So, just like Hitler viewed Germany and Poland. Either that or Mr. Pena Nieto is just the latest victim of the lies and smears by the U. S. media and the dishonest political class. Mr. Pena Nieto acknowledged the “fundamental right that each of the countries has to defend its border. ” Talking like that Mr. Pena Nieto would get kicked out of the Democratic Party in the U. S. He also repeatedly expressed his respect for the electoral process in America  —   a foreign concept to our own president who, even while traveling abroad, has denounced Mr. Trump’s qualifications and temperament to be president. On specific substantive issues, Mr. Pena Nieto conceded every major point that Mr. Trump has built his entire political campaign on. The North American Free Trade Agreement needs to be improved, he said. The border is porous and must to be secured. Criminals, guns, drugs, slaves and money pass back and forth with terrifying ease. Mr. Pena Nieto went out of his way to complain about guns being smuggled across the border into Mexico, a humiliating shot at Mr. Obama and his former Attorney General Eric Holder who were caught in a scheme to ship   guns to drug dealers and kingpins in Mexico. He also seemed to scold Mr. Obama’s   policy as a blinking neon “welcome” sign, drawing tens of thousands of people from all over the world into his country on their way into America. “There is still a joint challenge including the increasing number of   who cross through our country in order to reach the United States, therein creating serious human crises,” he said. Mr. Trump was cordial and statesmanlike  —   if blunt. “No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on innocent people, when cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons and cash flow from the United States into Mexico or when migrants from Central America make the dangerous trek  —   and it is very, very dangerous  —   into Mexico or the United States without legal authorization,” he said. Of course, the only question reporters asked was about how offended Mexicans have been by Mr. Trump and does Mr. Trump want to say sorry. Oh, and will Mexico really pay for the wall? As the question was being interpreted for Mr. Pena Nieto, Mr. Trump stepped in. “Well, I’ll start. Nothing like an easy question. ” Yes, they discussed the wall and their mutual desire to secure the border. No, he said, they did not talk about how Mexico will pay for it because it was a preliminary meeting. Sometimes best to leave thornier issues to later. As for the insults? “A lot of the things I said are very strong, but we have to be strong,” Mr. Trump explained. “We have to say what is happening. There is crime. As you know, there is a lot of crime and a lot of problems but I think together we will solve problems. ” Mr. Trump’s opponent, meanwhile, was back in the U. S. giving a lecture on “American exceptionalism. ” It has been 270 days since she held a press conference. Oh, and Hillary Clinton was consoling her most trusted consigliere who has just left her dirtbag husband after he sexted a picture of his “private” part alongside his baby son, lying in bed. I’m sorry which one of these candidates isn’t fit to be president? • You can follow Charles Hurt on Twitter via Charlie Hurt (@CharlesHurt) | Twitter",1.0

"Can Israelis And Palestinians Change Their Minds? . What makes people change their minds? About the really hard stuff. Covering the   conflict for the past three years, I’ve often wondered if people here ever do. This conflict is frequently described as ”intractable,” with neither side willing to give up their historical perspective or their entrenched positions to end it. And it does not take many interviews to hear repetitions of the same sweeping narrative repeated on each side. Palestinians from different places cite the same historical events to back their views. Israelis who have never met each other use similar turns of phrase. ”People have a lot of [psychological] resources invested in what they believe about the conflict,” says Thomas Zeitzoff, a political scientist at American University in Washington, D. C. who has researched Israeli and Palestinian attitudes. He says the high political stakes and emotional involvement make it hard for Israelis and Palestinians to change their minds. But there have been certain shifts  —   in public opinion and in individual beliefs   during the 68 years of Israel’s existence and almost   of the Israeli military control over Palestinian territories. Why? Experts list a range of influences that  —   to varying degrees  —   can move or even flip deeply held views. ”You can point to major events, either in the world or people’s lives, changes in their social context, as well as changes in the kind of messages they get from politicians and other elite sources,” says Brendan Nyhan, an assistant professor at Dartmouth College who researches politics and misperceptions. Other factors include repeated exposure to a new idea, whatever the source, scientific research, and direct personal experience. Four people  —   two Israeli and two Palestinian  —   told me their stories of personal, radical belief change related to the conflict. They not only changed their minds, but, a higher hurdle, their behavior. Here are some triggers that led these people to see the world differently than they had before, even in the midst of a larger impasse. Time With The Enemy, Many groups supporting   advocate for exposure to the other side. Knowledge develops empathy, they say, which can broaden an individual’s perspective as well as pique curiosity. Maayan Poleg is a Middle East program director for the group Seeds of Peace, which brings Palestinian and Israeli teens together for summer camp in Maine. She says the group does not advocate a particular political position and is not directly aiming to change minds. But time together, deliberately discussing the conflict, humanizes the enemy, she says, and helps participants question their assumptions, as well as navigate the onslaught of opinions from politicians, family and media to clarify their individual beliefs. ”They become open to accepting the fact that what they know as truth is a narrative. That’s a huge step,” Poleg said. ”People spend a lot of time defending a specific fact. And it takes them a long time to understand that their fact is actually a narrative. It doesn’t mean that it’s wrong. It just means that there’s another way to view it.” Palestinians and Israelis used to interact with some regularity, often in the workplace or the marketplace. But over the past 15 years, they have been increasingly separated physically. They now spend very little time together. But one Palestinian who went from throwing stones at Israeli soldiers to teaching   says he began to change his mind about violence while in an Israeli prison. While behind bars, he learned Hebrew, saw his first movie about the Holocaust, and got to know Israeli prison guards. ”It’s a process,” says Bassam Aramin, who became one of the   of Combatants for Peace, a group of former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian  . ”You never wake up in the morning and say, ’Oh my God, we are wrong. The Israelis are right. I give up fighting. ’” He remembers the first time he and other    —   Israeli and Palestinian   sat down together. He was scared. ”We don’t trust them. I think they’re from the Israeli intelligence. Maybe they are coming to arrest us,” Aramin recalls. He saw fear in the eyes of the Israeli men who sat down with him. ”It’s the first time they’re coming to meet a Palestinian terrorist. And they have this fear of maybe one of us will kidnap them and kill them.” Trust did build trust over time and many conversations. They built an organization that teaches empathy and understanding. But empathy is also vulnerable to a change of heart. Repeat Experiences  Many Israelis and Palestinians reached out to each other eagerly after leaders signed their   peace plan back in 1993. People were hopeful, and more open than ever to the idea they could live together peacefully, says Palestinian sociologist Nader Said. ”It was highly euphoric and highly exciting times,” he remembers. But that peace deal, the Oslo Accords, did not deliver on its promise. Violence returned with a vengeance when the second Palestinian uprising, or intifada, broke out in September 2000. Said, who has polled Palestinians since the   says by then Palestinian support for   had already begun to fall, as people grew disillusioned by the gap between expectations and reality. ”While they felt [Israeli] settlement activity would decline, settlement activity has increased,” he says. ”They felt maybe they’ll have more access to Jerusalem, they have less access now.” Palestinian Abla Masrujeh is part of this societal shift. Now 54, she invested her time, money and reputation in joint projects with Israelis in the 1990s. She organized Israeli visits to her hometown of Nablus, in the West Bank, where they shared meals and visited Palestinian homes. She helped present a Tel Aviv exhibition of handcrafts done by women from both sides. But when violence broke out once again, she felt her new Israeli friends did not understand her experiences as Israeli soldiers swept through the West Bank, or her point of view. ”All this made me rethink my position and my opinion of Israelis,” Masrujeh says. Israelis went through the same reversal of hope, says pollster Tamar Hermann. ”The repeated failures in achieving something tangible, and then the huge waves of terror, this made people think maybe it’s not workable,” she says. ”People started to doubt whether the cognitive change which opened the door for the   solution was justifiable.” Many Israelis cite repeated suicide bombings, in cafes and on buses during the second intifada, from 2000 to 2005, as the beginning of a national shift in attitudes toward Palestinians. American social psychologist Jay Van Bavel says accumulated experience often leads to change. ”Like a rat pressing a lever. If it gets a pellet, it will press the lever again. People are the same way,” he says. A Personal Search For Meaning, Over a decade, Israeli Tamar Asraf’s mind and lifestyle turned 180 degrees around. She describes the process not as repetitive feedback, but as digging deeper. Once secular and opposed to Israel’s West Bank settlements as an obstacle to peace, Asraf is now religious and a spokesperson for Eli, a growing settlement in the central West Bank. ”It works like this. You get more connected to yourself, you get more connected to your private roots, then you get more connected to your national roots,” Asraf says of her journey. Exposed to religious Jews during her army service, Asraf began to feel her secular upbringing left huge gaps. When she began to study Judaism, her sense of connection to biblical places in the West Bank grew, trumping Palestinian claims to the same land. Israel’s political power base has shifted to the right over the past two decades, says Avi Dgani, an Israeli expert in mapping social and political dynamics. But even though identity politics, magnified by frequent violence and international attention, play a large role in the   conflict, Dgani says big personal swings such as the one Asraf experienced aren’t all that common. That’s because many people don’t deeply question their personal beliefs, or, subsequently, their politics, Dgani says. He cites last year’s   of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an example. A third of Netanyahu backers chose him simply because ”me and my father and my forefather, we always voted right,” Dgani says. Birds Of A Feather  Once people change their minds, one of the most powerful ways to maintain that new belief is to find new friends who share it. Asraf moved to a settlement because the people there followed the same religious practices she had recently adopted. Once there, she started voting for   leaders, as do most of her neighbors. Another Israeli, Noam Chayut, shifted to the left politically. He says small jolts shook his beliefs briefly along the way, but real change took off when he found   people. Chayut wrote a book, The Girl Who Stole My Holocaust, about his change from Zionist soldier to   of Breaking the Silence, an organization of former soldiers who share anonymous stories critical of Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank. Time and a great deal of reflection were key to Chayut’s realization that his core beliefs had changed. ”Soldiers get orders, they obey,” he says. ”You just do things. But reflecting on it, I did things that were close to my moral boundary.” People can be pushed to change their minds when they sense a clash between their beliefs and actions has become too strong. But change is hard because people protect themselves against internal dissonance, especially in situations as emotionally and politically laden as this conflict, says Thomas Zeitzoff, the American political scientist who has studied how narratives can change here. ”We think people engage in what psychologists would call ’motivated cognition,’” says Zeitzoff. ”To avoid things that may threaten our own view of selves or others, maybe motivated in a benign way to remember certain facts more than others, and selectively ignore things that contradict beliefs.” And that’s just one of the reasons it’s so hard to change.",-0.5
"Samsung leader quizzed for over 22 hours in South Korea corruption scandal.  Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee left the South Korean special prosecutor’s office early on Friday after more than 22 hours of questioning on bribery suspicions in an   scandal that could topple President Park  . Lee left the special prosecution office without answering reporters’ questions and headed to a waiting car.    Prosecutors have been investigating whether Samsung provided 30 billion won ($25. 46 million) to a business and foundations backed by Park’s friend, Choi   in exchange for the national pension fund’s support for a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. The special prosecutor’s office said it would decide by Sunday whether to seek a warrant to arrest    Lee, the   leader of South Korea’s largest conglomerate, or chaebol. There were no plans to bring him in for further questioning. Lee denied some of the suspicions against him but had admitted to others, said Lee   a spokesman for the special prosecutors’ office who declined to elaborate. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment. The corruption scandal has engulfed the highest reaches of South Korea’s elite, with Park impeached by parliament in December, a decision that must be upheld or overturned by the Constitutional Court. Park, who has been stripped of her powers in the meantime, has denied wrongdoing. Jay Y. Lee was named as a suspect on Wednesday and summoned on Thursday morning for questioning. Prosecutors were looking into whether he gave false testimony during a parliamentary hearing in early December, where the heads of nine of South Korea’s biggest chaebol were subjected to an unprecedented   televised grilling by a panel investigating the presidential scandal. Jay Y. Lee denied bribery accusations during that hearing, rejecting assertions from lawmakers that Samsung lobbied to get the fund to back the merger. The chiefs of South Korean chaebol have over the years had prison sentences shortened or forgiven, or received pardons, with the economic impact of imprisonment cited as a factor. Jay Y. Lee’s father Lee   who has been incapacitated since a 2014 heart attack, was handed a   suspended jail sentence in 2009 for tax evasion. He was later pardoned. Asked whether prosecutors would take into account any economic impact in their decision on whether to seek Jay Y. Lee’s arrest, spokesman Lee   said: ”From the point of the special prosecutor, we are conducting the investigation by law and principle. There is nothing further that I can say in that regard.” Shares in group flagship Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest smartphone maker, ended 3. 45 percent lower on Friday.      EQUESTRIAN SPONSORSHIP The special prosecution also questioned Park   a president at Samsung Electronics, for about 13 hours until early on Friday. Park   had signed a contract for Samsung Electronics in 2015 to sponsor an equestrian team, the main beneficiary of which was the daughter of President Park’s friend Choi, a key figure in the scandal who is in detention and undergoing a criminal trial. Choi has denied wrongdoing. Her daughter,    Chung   was arrested by Danish police early this month after she was sought by South Korean authorities. Chung, who won a gold medal in group dressage at the 2014 Asian Games, has denied wrongdoing. Park   who had refused to appear at parliamentary hearings on the matter citing health issues, did not comment to reporters as he left the prosecutors’ office at about 3 a. m. (1900 GMT Thursday) wearing a white face mask. Two other Samsung Group executives were questioned by special prosecutors on Monday and released. Samsung has acknowledged making payments to two foundations at the center of the scandal, as well as to a consulting firm controlled by Choi, but has repeatedly denied accusations of lobbying to push through the controversial 2015 merger of affiliates Samsung C&T Corp and Cheil Industries Inc. Dozens of South Korean corporate groups made contributions totaling 77. 4 billion won ($65. 75 million) to two foundations that were set up to back President Park’s initiatives, but Samsung’s donations were the largest. Late last month, the head of South Korea’s National Pension Service, the world’s   pension fund, was arrested after he acknowledged that he had pressured the fund to approve the $8 billion merger between the two Samsung Group [SAGR. UL] affiliates while he was head of the health ministry, reversing an earlier public denial.

"Judge Tosses Challenge to NC Law, Allows Magistrates to Avoid Same-Sex Marriages - Breitbart. Three couples are appealing to the Fourth U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, after a federal judge dismissed their challenge of a law in North Carolina that allows magistrates to cite religious beliefs for not performing   marriages. [The plaintiffs were three couples  —   one interracial and two homosexual  —   that challenged the law. The judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the case, emphasizing that none of the six individuals could show evidence that they were personally affected by the law.  However, U. S. District Judge Max Cogburn noted that someone could potentially suffer harm under the law. Roughly five percent of magistrates in North Carolina have filed recusal notices under the   law, according to the Associated Press and the CBS affiliate, WNCN. Republican North Carolina state Senator Phil Berger applauded the court’s decision, issuing a statement reading, “We appreciate the court recognizing the plaintiffs failed to identify even one North Carolinian who was denied the ability to get married under this reasonable law which protects fundamental First Amendment rights. ”",1.0
"Trump: ""I'd love to see a shutdown"". During a White House roundtable on MS-13 with Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, lawmakers and law enforcement officials Tuesday, President Trump said he would ""love to see"" a government shutdown if Democrats don't support his immigration plan: Trump sought to usher in his immigration reforms through the lens of MS-13 by blaming Democrats for refusing to close immigration loopholes, which he said is causing gang members to enter the country and recruiting unaccompanied minors.  Yes but, Trump's shutdown comments seem to contradict what most lawmakers have been saying: that a shutdown isn't likely, largely because they don't expect a DACA deal to even be tied the spending bill. Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, who met earlier this morning to negotiate the budget, both said they were optimistic that they were nearing an agreement. ",0.0
"Grandfather Apologizes After Dylann Roof’s Guilty Pleas Add to Sentence - The New York Times. CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   As Dylann S. Roof made what was probably his final appearance in open court, his grandfather offered the earnest apology to the families of Mr. Roof’s nine   victims that the Charleston church killer has steadfastly declined to make on his own. “I just want to say loudly and repeatedly and constantly we’re sorry,” Joseph Roof, a Columbia, S. C. real estate lawyer, said on Monday in Charleston County Circuit Court. “We’re just as sorry as we can be that this has happened. We regret it. It has ruined lives, and I cannot put those back together. ” His grandson, a white supremacist who had just pleaded guilty to nine counts of murder for the June 17, 2015, massacre at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, looked ahead impassively, just as when sentenced to death in federal court in January. Under a plea arrangement, he received life terms for each of the murder charges, which will be appended consecutively to the 18 death sentences imposed by a judge and jury in his federal trial. Mr. Roof turned down an offer to address the court directly on Monday, leaving his grandfather as his only advocate. It was the first time a relative had spoken on his behalf in court. “Everyone should understand that nothing is all bad, and Dylann is not all bad,” Joseph Roof said, adding that he and his wife pray each day for the victims’ families. “There’s no way we could ever feel what they’ve felt and what they’ve lost, just as no one can understand what we’ve been through. ” The elder Mr. Roof, who occasionally attended the federal trial, said he still could not fathom what had driven his grandson to such violence in the expressed hope of inciting a race war. “I will go to my grave not understanding what happened,” he said. The   hearing Monday effectively ended the   prosecution of Mr. Roof, who turned 23 a week ago. He is expected to be transferred soon to a federal penitentiary to await execution while appealing the death sentences he received in United States District Court. A federal jury found Mr. Roof guilty in December on 33 counts of hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of exercise of religion and use of a firearm to commit murder, then returned after the holidays to determine his punishment. Both state and federal prosecutors pursued the death penalty against Mr. Roof for different charges, but the federal government won the race to try him first. The Justice Department rejected Mr. Roof’s offer to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, citing the number of his victims and the heinous nature of his crimes. His sentencing in federal court  —   directly across Broad Street from the county judicial building  —   left Scarlett Wilson, the chief prosecutor for Charleston County, to decide whether redundant death sentences were necessary. She said she chose to spare the survivors and victims’ families the added trauma of sitting through a second presentation of gruesome crime scene photos and remorseless confessions. “We believe this is the surest way to see that Dylann Roof is executed,” she said on Monday. The testimony in Mr. Roof’s federal trial showed that he had plotted his attack for months, scouting the location during numerous visits from his home near Columbia. On the night of June 17, 2015, he walked through the church’s unlocked side door and joined 12 worshipers gathered for Bible study in the fellowship hall. The pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was also a state senator, invited the visitor to sit next to him. Mr. Roof said little until the church members closed their eyes in benediction. At that point, he removed a Glock . 45 caliber handgun from his fanny pack and began picking off his victims, one after the next, starting with Mr. Pinckney. Two women and a girl survived, and Mr. Roof’s guilty pleas on Monday included three counts of attempted murder. Several victims’ family members spoke briefly at the hearing, including Nadine Collier, the daughter of Ethel Lance, a victim. It was Ms. Collier who stunned the nation by leading a procession of family members who expressed forgiveness for Mr. Roof at his bond hearing, only two days after the shootings. She reinforced that message in addressing Mr. Roof on Monday. “I just want to say,” Ms. Collier said, “have mercy on your soul. ”",-1.0
"Steve Bannon on Wall Street Reform: ’It’s Not That Money Controls Washington. Washington Controls the Money’ - Breitbart. Stephen K. Bannon (or, for those who want to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon)  —     Donald Trump’s pick for White House chief strategist  —   made his pet issues known long before joining Trump’s insurgent presidential campaign. Now, Americans can reflect on what issues Bannon may take on within a Trump White House  —   and it does not look good for the culture of corruption in Washington, DC.  In January 2013, Bannon appeared on Fox News’ Hannity with Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer for a special called “Boomtown. ” This report, covered extensively in Breitbart at the time, shines a light on his view of what is wrong with our nation’s capital. At the time, Bannon was Executive Chairman of both Breitbart News and GAI. Bannon and Schweizer argued that the “permanent political class” in Washington “extracts” power from the rest of the country so they can make money without producing actual goods. “There is a business model there,” Schweizer says of DC. Some key quotes from Bannon’s own words show that he, a former Wall Street banker, sees the problem as Washington controlling the money, “not that money controls Washington”: The rest of the country is in a financial and economic crisis. Much of the country is almost in a depression. And, yet, you have Washington with the three richest counties bordering it seven out of top 10, the big number, per capita income is now higher than Silicon Valley. The great technology engine in the United States.   …     And this is a bipartisan problem, this is not just beat down on Democrats although they have the party of big government. This is a permanent  —   class that has now kind of formed an aristocracy. And that aristocracy, that’s why nothing changes in Washington, that’s why you have these budget debates. And like you said, you’re talking about cuts and growth rates of budgets, not cut in the budgets. It’s not a downside.   …     It’s not that money controls Washington. Washington controls the money. They have an industrial logic to this business model just like any other business model. And that is to extract power from the rest of the country in money into centralized location which is Washington. With Bannon’s painting of a   on bipartisan corruption and politicians’   it is easy to see why establishment media is slinging so much mud at him right now.",1.0
"Teamsters’ Jimmy Hoffa Lavishes Praise on President Trump on Trade Policy - Breitbart. International Brotherhood of Teamsters president James P. Hoffa praised President Donald J. Trump’s move to crush the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) once and for all on Monday, the second major labor union leader to do so. [Hoffa  —   like   president Richard Trumka who also praised Trump on Monday without naming him  —   also praised President Trump’s efforts to work with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as well.  Unline Trumka, however, Hoffa showed he’s willing to name Trump in his release. Hoffa said in a statement: Today, President Trump made good on his campaign promise to withdraw the United States from the   Partnership. With this decision, the president has taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies that have cost working Americans millions of   jobs. The Teamsters Union has been on the frontline of the fight to stop destructive trade deals like the TPP, China PNTR, CAFTA and NAFTA for decades. Millions of working men and women saw their jobs leave the country as free trade policies undermined our manufacturing industry. We hope that President Trump’s meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Jan. 31 opens a real dialogue about fixing the flawed NAFTA. We take this development as a positive sign that President Trump will continue to fulfill his campaign promises in regard to trade policy reform and instruct the USTR to negotiate future agreements that protect American workers and industry. Jonathan Swan of Axios, one of the top journalists covering the Trump administration, noted after the   statement that this could be the beginning of Trump stealing a broad and crucial part of the Democrats’ electoral coalition: union workers. Swan wrote on Monday: The   relationship will be one of the more interesting in American politics over the first term of the new administration. Trump and top advisers like Steve Bannon see an opportunity to destroy traditional political alliances. Their theory worked in the election: They peeled white working class voters (and many union households) away from the Democrats. Now, they believe that delivering major items for this constituency  —   watch also for a confrontation with Big Pharma  —   could further wreck the Democrats’ hold on organized labor. But, Swan offered a word of “caution” on this front as well: “If Trump pursues more traditional Republican policies  —   like slashing taxes and regulations and repealing and replacing ObamaCare  —   he could quickly undo much of his goodwill with unions. ” Sources close to the president, however, confirm to Breitbart News that the president plans to approach these issues and others not from traditional partisan perspectives but from a more pragmatic   angle, something likely to keep appealing to union workers nationwide in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania  —   all key states that Trump won in his shocker landslide 306 electoral vote victory over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.",1.0
"Long-Lost 9/11 Flag, an Enduring Mystery, Will Go on View at Museum - The New York Times. The moment was captured in a photograph, an unforgettable image that was seared in the world’s collective memory as a symbol of resilience: three firefighters raising an American flag amid the ruins of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Soon after, the flag disappeared. New York City officials tried to track it down, to no avail. Now the flag has been recovered, though the mystery has not been entirely solved. On Thursday, nearly 15 years after it first flew, the flag will again become a prominent part of Lower Manhattan when it goes on display at the National September 11 Memorial  Museum. The flag’s return required a transcontinental trip: It was recovered in Washington State. On Sept. 11, 2001, three firefighters  —   Billy Eisengrein, George Johnson and Dan McWilliams  —   removed the flag and its pole from the Star of America, a yacht that had been moored at the North Cove marina on the Hudson River. Thomas E. Franklin, a photographer for The Record, a newspaper in northern New Jersey, captured the moment when it was raised at ground zero. After flying at ground zero, the flag, or so it was believed at the time, was unfurled at Yankee Stadium and on naval ships in the Middle East before returning to City Hall in 2002. But it turned out the flag  —   which was signed by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, among others  —   was not the right one. The yacht’s flag measured 3 feet by 5 feet the autographed flag was 5 feet by 8 feet. The flag’s whereabouts was not known until late 2014, after the mystery was featured on the first episode of “Brad Meltzer’s Lost History,” which was broadcast on H2, a spinoff of the History Channel. “All we did was put up the   version of the wanted poster,” said Mr. Meltzer, an author of thriller novels and children’s books as well as a writer for television. “We put that flag on TV. ” The episode, which uses a grainy video to show that the flag disappeared on the night of the terrorist attack, was broadcast on Oct. 31. Four days later, a man carrying a plastic bag walked into a fire station in Everett, Wash. He had seen the show and believed he had the flag. “He used the name Brian,” said Mark St. Clair, the deputy chief of operations at the Everett Police Department. “At least that’s what the firefighters recall him using. ” Brian said he was a former Marine who had been deployed in the Middle East. He was given the flag, according to the firefighters’ account provided to Mr. St. Clair, by a worker at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who had in turn been given the flag by the widow of someone killed on Sept. 11 in New York. Mr. St. Clair said it was unclear whether the firefighters knew about the   flag or that it was missing. But out of respect for the flag that was turned in, they unclipped it from its halyard, folded it and told their superiors. The police began investigating. “In the beginning it was just a flag that was returned,” said Kim Gilmore, a senior historian at the History Channel. “There was a lot of work to determine if it was the ground zero flag. ” Mr. St. Clair gathered footage from cameras near the firehouse and released police sketches of Brian, based on descriptions from firefighters, to a local newspaper, but that effort did not yield results. The sketch also did not provide any leads at NOAA. On Sunday, the 15th anniversary of the attacks, the History Channel will broadcast a program on the flag’s recovery. During the show, John W. Cutter, who was a member of the New York Police Department’s criminal intelligence section and retired as a deputy chief in 2004, expresses doubts that the flag came from a widow. Flags used at burials typically do not have any rope or hardware. “This leads me to believe that he received the flag in some other fashion and is afraid to say how he got it,” Mr. Cutter said, referring to the Marine. Another figure central to the effort to verify the flag’s authenticity was Bill Schneck, a forensic materials scientist with Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory who had previously worked for the McCrone Group, a testing firm in Westmont, Ill. that specializes in particle identification. “In this case, I compared the dust on the flag to known dust samples collected by others in the days after ” Mr. Schneck said. That dust was a mixture of concrete, glass fibers, plastic, molten pieces of metal and asbestos. “It was like what you would call a fingerprint,” Mr. Schneck said. His analysis of the particles on the flag showed the same characteristics as particle types in the dust after the towers fell. Mr. Schneck also conducted an extensive photographic comparison of the flag in Washington to   images of the Sept. 11 flag taken by Mr. Franklin and provided by The Record. The two flags were the same size and made from the same material, and each had a brass and a stainless steel snap and halyards with distinctive knots and wraps of black electrical tape. The History Channel enlisted Monica Rosero, who worked on the Star of America, to help with the identification. She recognized the hardware and rope and said the black tape was the handiwork of her husband Carlos Rosero, the boat’s engineer, who died in 2008. By July, the findings of the investigation “led us to believe that we had enough information that we could release that flag to someone claiming ownership,” Mr. St. Clair said. The flag was then sent back to New York. How the flag ended up across the country is a piece of the puzzle that remains unsolved. Among those who were informed that the flag had been found was Shirley B. Dreifus, who along with her husband, Spiros E. Kopelakis, owned the Star of America. “It’s truly amazing,” Ms. Dreifus, who sold the yacht in 2008, said. “In fact, ‘stunning’ is the way I put it. ” Ms. Dreifus said she was saddened that her husband, who died nearly two years ago, could not share in the news. “He called it the icon of the century,” she said. “This was the only symbol of hope that day. ” She and the Chubb insurance company, which paid a claim on the flag, donated it to the Sept. 11 museum. Joseph C. Daniels, the chief executive and president of the memorial and museum, said: “To not have that flag as a part of the museum, it always felt like there was something missing. It was a symbol of not only hope, but of strength. We needed both at the time. ”",-1.0

" How The Best Podcast Of The Year Was Made.     —   the podcast also known by the uncensored title Shittown  —   has captured listeners’ imaginations, and dominated the iTunes charts, due to its astonishing strengths: the deftness of its prose, the complexity of its pacing, and its humane,   treatment of its characters. As assembled into seven chapters by reporter Brian Reed of This American Life and executive producer Julie Snyder of Serial, the show starts out in   territory similar to the first season of Serial: Reed heads to the tiny Alabama town of Woodstock to investigate a possible murder at the behest of one of its residents, John B. McLemore. The podcast, however, ends up exploring far less familiar terrain. (Warning: This story contains MAJOR SPOILERS for anyone who has not finished  .) For one, Reed discovers that the murder he’s investigating never happened. For another, McLemore asserts himself as  ’s true subject  —   an essentially retired antique clock restorer, the    emerges as a     Deep South eccentric with an inexhaustible intellectual curiosity and fits of profane disquisition. As an example, after just a few minutes in his first conversation with Reed, McLemore rattled off the exact GPS coordinates for a hedge maze he created on his property from memory. Later, he said that as a teenager he was into “the astrolabe, sundials, projective geometry, new wave music, climate change, and how to solve Rubik’s cubes,” before launching into a rant about “the cool Greenland melt falling directly into the less dense water where the thermohaline convector normally heads back south  …    ”   really comes into its own at the end of Chapter II, when Reed gets a shocking call from one of McLemore’s friends, informing him that McLemore killed himself two days prior, by ingesting cyanide. For the rest of the podcast, Reed pursues the fallout from McLemore’s suicide, and   transforms into an intimate and sprawling portrait of the man, the people who knew him best, and the community that shaped his life  —   a community that so repulsed McLemore, he gave it the name that Reed then adopted for the title of the podcast. With all seven episodes released at the same time, the result feels like the first podcast that unfolds like a piece of audio literature, with the storytelling care and humane complexity of works of narrative nonfiction like Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood or Jon Krakauer’s Into the Wild. Listening to it is like witnessing the invention of a stirring and sublime work of art. Reed and Snyder spoke with BuzzFeed News about how the show came together, and how they navigated the many burning questions listeners were certain to have after finishing it. After McLemore killed himself on June 22, 2015, Reed was unsure that his reporting in Woodstock would ever amount to a story, let alone a   podcast. “I wanted to just go to his funeral,” Reed said. “We weren’t sure what to do.   …     I was doing many other stories during the time I was talking to John, and [ ] was kind of something I would do when I had time, on the side. ” At This American Life, Reed explained, roughly half of the stories staffers pursue ultimately get killed, and his journey with McLemore might have gone that direction. “What happened after he died is that at least two reporting threads presented themselves to us,” Reed said. “I legitimately had questions about this man’s life. There were people who seemed to know him well who weren’t contacted [after he died]. And then also, the people I did know who were close to him were telling me that there was something nefarious going on in the wake of his suicide, and were keeping in touch with me about it. That seemed like something very clear to report on and document. ” Reed estimated that he spoke with “two or three dozen” people for over a year after McLemore died, through interviews conducted on the record, on background, and off the record. He is unsure of the precise number of hours of recordings he amassed in total. “A hundred?” he said after a long pause. “More than a hundred? I really don’t know, honestly! I try not to think about it that way, because it overwhelms my mind. ” To make sense of it all, he and Snyder created a massive spreadsheet that organized all the interviews and what was said in them before they started piecing together the structure for the show. And that’s when they began to understand that   wasn’t anything like a typical radio story. “There isn’t a totally clear question that [Reed] set out with at the beginning, which is generally how I would say 98% of This American Life stories are structured,” said Snyder. Without a central question, they knew the podcast would have to be, at least in part, a profile of McLemore  —   a format Snyder called “really anathema to radio” due to its lack of a strong   narrative. “For those reasons, I felt like it’s important for it to feel that Brian has a story to bring you, and you’re going to have to trust that he knows the beginning, the middle, and the end of this story,” she said. “I felt like that’s what you get when you read a novel. You open the first page, you have no idea where you are and why you’re there, but you have a confidence that you know you can physically see there’s a final page, and the author has a story to tell you. ” Reed added that the very nature of his reporting  —   especially “the metaphors that John was handing me” in their interviews  —   leant itself to a literary approach. “He’s a horologist,” he said. “He’s got a giant maze in his backyard with 64 different solutions and one with no way out. ‘Shittown’ as a concept even seems literary  —   the very multifaceted way in which he employed that word. And it seemed to encapsulate not only his town but much larger ideas about the failures in society, statewide, nationally, globally. ” The sheer length of time Reed took to report the story even ended up contributing to the podcast’s novelistic appeal. “We realized when we sat down to structure it that I’d accidentally given myself the power of omniscience, in a way, and of foreshadowing,” said Reed. “We’d be talking about a scene that happened a year and a half ago, that we’re putting in the story, and I knew something from the future about that person, or that scene. People have literally died and been born in the time that I’ve been around the people in Woodstock. ” The style of   also sets the podcast apart as a piece of journalism: Many of the concrete questions Reed explored  —   like the location of McLemore’s purported stash of gold, or the reason behind why many of McLemore’s friends didn’t learn about his death until after his funeral  —   remain unresolved by the show’s end. “I mean, I wanted to answer them, and I did my best in reporting them, and presented my best findings,” said Reed. Snyder also stressed that   relied on   best practices of journalism  —   checking and rechecking facts, tracking down interviews, finding documentation, etc.  —   even if that wasn’t always apparent in the way they presented Reed’s reporting, given the conversational tone of the show. “The idea is that maybe the reporting is kind of a little   also,” she said, causing Reed to laugh. “What makes up the story is really very traditional, unglamorous, kind of sloggy reporting. ” “When we’re making a story, for a large part we’re making it for ourselves and our own taste. ” (One thing they didn’t stress: getting photos of McLemore or anyone else from   for the podcast’s website, which has almost no photos at all. “I hate pictures,” Snyder said with a laugh. “I’m highly opposed to pictures with radio stories. I don’t know if I’ll always think that’s true, but 93% of the time, I will always say no pictures. That’s what the internet’s for. ”) Ultimately, however, the more traditional journalism that propels This American Life and Serial, driven by seeking conclusive answers to explicit questions, just didn’t apply to    —   and that was fine with its makers. “For Julie and me, those aren’t the things that interest us most about the story,” said Reed. “When we’re making a story, for a large part we’re making it for ourselves and our own taste. And in that regard, it would have been cool to be able to report some of that stuff out further than I did. But it wasn’t terribly upsetting to us. ”  ’s final chapter includes a moment from early on in Reed’s reporting when he spoke with McLemore’s   son Tyler Goodson, another of the story’s central characters. His life was upended the most by McLemore’s death, in part due to his efforts to collect items from McLemore’s property that he claimed were his. Due to the legal dispute over who owned the land and everything on it, Reed counseled Goodson about revealing on the record whether he’d found the cache of gold McLemore hinted he’d hidden on his property. “Well, listen, I clearly want to know if you ever do find it. But you should think about it before you tell me, if you ever do, because it’s then going to be public,” Reed tells Goodson on the show. “Yeah, I know. That’s what I’m scared of now,” Goodson replies. “I would worry if you found a million dollars in gold, or if you found, like, a bunch of gold,” says Reed. “Just consider it before you ever tell me, all right?” After a pause, Goodson asks Reed to turn off his recorder, and Reed, in voiceover, explains that they’d had “a discussion off the record. ” That is the last we hear about McLemore’s gold on    —   and that’s where Reed wants to leave it, at least for now. “I’ve really said as much as I feel comfortable saying in the show itself,” he said. Reed also pushed back at the suggestion that placing that conversation at the end of the show might leave listeners with the impression that Goodson did, indeed, find at least some gold. “Actually, I think if you look online, people are having all sorts of conclusions,” said Reed. “That was not our intention. ” Reed and Snyder said they only meant to give listeners the most    information they had on the record about Goodson’s legal situation (which, by the way, has not changed since the show went live  —   he’s is still awaiting trial on several charges). “Also, people in the story speculate that Tyler took the gold, so we did have a responsibility to run the question past him,” Snyder said. One theory on the whereabouts of McLemore’s gold is that the Woodstock police could have either made off with it themselves or looked the other way when someone else did. Conspicuously, however, Reed said no police officers would speak with him despite multiple requests for an interview. All he got were written responses to some questions he sent to the town’s chief of police, which included the department’s denial that they had found any gold on McLemore’s property (as Reed noted in Chapter V). Another voice largely absent from   is McLemore’s mother, Mary Grace, whose   becomes the first spark of conflict between Goodson and her next of kin, McLemore’s cousin Rita and her husband Charlie. But Reed said he did get a chance to interview Mary Grace on the record after Rita and Charlie brought him to see her. “I saw where she was staying, and she did seem to be doing well,” he said. “She was in pretty good spirits. She’s very   despite her clear dementia, and funny, and kind of biting sometimes. ” Reed ultimately chose not to use any of his recorded interviews with Mary Grace in the podcast. “It didn’t seem to fit into the story,” he said, choosing his words carefully. “It wasn’t the most  …    her faculties are not there in terms of an interview. ” He did, however, use some of what he learned from Mary Grace. “For instance, the detail I include in the last [chapter] about her rubbing her stomach and praying for a genius,” he said. “I had heard that story from someone else she had told it to, but then she told me that multiple times on the record. ” As far as Reed knows, Mary Grace is still staying with family friends. “The last I heard in the last couple months, she’s been thriving and doing well. ” McLemore kept a small army of stray dogs on his sprawling property, and there was some question as to what would become of them  —   McLemore had requested that they be euthanized after he killed himself. It turns out, they’re almost certainly fine. “For a long time, at least two of them were with Tyler,” said Reed. “And then it’s my understanding that homes were found for the rest. I don’t have the firmest information on this, but to my knowledge, they were not euthanized. ” Although   has earned wide critical acclaim, responses to the podcast have not been uniformly positive. A recent Vox essay with the headline “  is a stunning podcast. It probably shouldn’t have been made. ” typifies a lot of the criticism of the show  —   namely, that Reed went too far in exploring the intimate details of McLemore’s romantic and sexual history with other men without McLemore’s expressed consent to do so. It is an argument that frustrates Reed and Snyder. They both note that McLemore outed himself in his second email to This American Life, and was always up front about his sexuality with Reed when he was alive. “I didn’t ask him about that, I was asking about a murder. He put it on the table,” Reed said. “I thought it would be very odd to talk about John and not talk about his experience with love. ” Reed and Snyder decided that discussing McLemore’s sexuality was necessary to paint a full portrait of the man and his community. “In terms of the very particular experience of a gay man in his forties who grew up in Alabama in Bibb County, it’s unique,” said Snyder. “I thought it would be very odd to talk about John and not talk about his experience with love.   …     I think it’s meaningful for a lot of people who had that experience. ” Snyder suggested that uneasiness with exploring McLemore’s sexuality could have something to do with society’s larger issues with intimacy between two men. She cited a passage in Chapter VI featuring Olin Long, a close confidant of McLemore’s who wrestled with his desire for something beyond friendship between them. Long reached out to Reed specifically to speak on the record about McLemore he shared an anecdote about sitting in McLemore’s pickup truck with him and experiencing a surge of deep feeling for his friend. Long tells Reed on the podcast, “I wanted to reach over there, I wanted to pull his shirt up, expose his belly, and just kiss all over his belly around that red hair, just to that extent. And I wanted to do it slowly and sensuously. That’s what I wanted to do, and see what he thought about it. ” “It’s incredibly intimate, when Olin talks about what could have been,” Snyder said. “Brian knows, I would squirm [listening to it]. I would be totally like, ‘Oh god, where’s he going? ’” She compared it to her reaction to watching the beach scene in the film Moonlight during which two teenage boys have a sexual encounter. “I totally squirmed then, too. I think there’s a bit of homophobia in squirming at that intimacy. I recognized it in myself when I saw Moonlight, and I recognized it in Olin’s talking about John. ”   also explores another complex form of intimacy, which McLemore shared with Goodson, a straight man in his   in a ritual the two men referred to as “church”: Goodson would run a tattoo gun over McLemore’s body, over and over again, often without any ink, to inflict a kind of targeted pain. The Vox piece criticized Reed for not correctly characterizing “church” as the BDSM practice of “needle play,” something Reed takes strong issue with. “I could never do that because that’s not how Tyler characterizes it,” Reed said. “That would be me imposing a thing onto the person who actually partook in it. I’m open to the idea that these are complicated activities that can mean many things at once. But the way that it was described to me by Tyler is that it helped [McLemore] relieve his pain. It helped him be able to sleep at night. It cleared his mind of his worries, which is similar to cutting, and we checked with a social worker, and they agreed. ” Reed felt that he was justified in including these details about “church” because they involved Goodson just as much as they involved McLemore. “Tyler talked to me about it many times. It was something he was dealing with in the wake of John’s death. ” He’d heard multiple people in Woodstock say that Goodson was a bad influence on McLemore, but Goodson said McLemore was the one pleading with him to do “church” every night, Reed said. “I thought it helped give a much fuller and more complicated picture of their relationship at the end. We were very judicious about what we did include. There was much more that we did not.   …     We tried to treat it with as much care as possible. ” According to Reed, McLemore never really expressed much of a political opinion beyond his low opinion of politics in general. “He thinks of the Democratic and Republican parties as twin cheeks on the same ass,” Reed said. “But we didn’t delve much deeper than that. ” McLemore died a week after Donald Trump formally announced that he was running for president in 2015 as the rest of the media world scrambled to understand Trump voters the next year, Reed and Snyder had their heads down putting   together. They said they didn’t really think about the fact that their show was set among exactly the kind of   white voters who made up a big part of Trump’s base. However, Reed did have to personally confront at least one issue wrapped up with some of those supporters: Reed’s wife is black, and many of the people he spoke to for   including McLemore, held racist attitudes and used racist terms. At a certain point in his reporting, his spouse’s race became much harder to keep private. “With Tyler and his family, I was just spending so much time with them that, like, eventually they wanted to be friends on Facebook,” he said. “We talked about the use of certain words. And I told him that they made me uncomfortable. It’s a weird position to be in as a journalist, because you don’t want people to censor themselves. So that’s not what I was trying to do. But I was also trying to be myself, you know? But [Goodson] was fine. Like, it was not an issue. And some of the language did calm down after that, actually. ” And then, well into the editing process for   Trump was elected president. At first, Reed was plunged into despair. “The day after the election, I remember coming in and feeling like, What the hell’s the point of this story?” Reed said. “There’s all this stuff going on in the world to cover. I want to be back at my normal job where I can do reporting about things that are actually happening now, that are relevant to the world. And then the next day, I remember feeling like, Oh, maybe this is a little bit what the story’s about. ” After some discussion,  ’s connection to the Trump voter didn’t really end up changing their approach to the podcast. “I think we just kind of comforted ourselves with that thought,” he said, laughing with Snyder. “It was a way to feel OK about why we weren’t reporting on the incoming administration and the very surprising election. ”  ’s popularity has already elicited inquiries about possible movie or TV adaptations. “There’s definitely been interest,” said Snyder. “I’m very literal, so I have a hard time being like, What would it be, other than just people speaking the lines of the podcast? But it would be cool to see. ” Given  ’s reception, one might expect Reed, Snyder, and the This American Life and Serial teams to be talking seriously about how to make another podcast that attempts the same narrative style again. “What makes anything feel new, is that the creators are trying to fend off their own boredom. ” “We’re so bad at that,” said Snyder. “No. I know, I know. It sounds like I’m being paternalistic when I’m like, ‘No, trust me, you like us better this way.’ If we thought that way, we would have come out of the first season of Serial and looked for another murder story. If anything, we actively move against it. ” “I think part of what makes the thing feel new, and what made Serial feel new, and what makes anything feel new, is that the creators are trying to fend off their own boredom,” added Reed. “So to try to recreate this  —   I don’t know. ” “I told you that my brother wants us to do Shittown Season 2 in my hometown?” Snyder said to Reed with a laugh. “That’s what we joked about, the anthology series of Shittown. We’ll just do Shittowns across America. ”   ",-1.0
"Populist Anger Upends Politics on Both Sides of the Atlantic - The New York Times. LONDON  —   From Brussels to Berlin to Washington, leaders of the Western democratic world awoke Friday morning to a blunt,   rebuke delivered by the flinty citizens of a small island nation in the North Atlantic. Populist anger against the established political order had finally boiled over. The British had rebelled. Their stunning vote to leave the European Union presents a political, economic and existential crisis for a bloc already reeling from entrenched problems. But the     message is hardly limited to Britain. The same yawning gap between the elite and mass opinion is fueling a populist backlash in Austria, France, Germany and elsewhere on the Continent  —   as well as in the United States. The symbolism of   insurrection was rich on Friday: Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and embodiment of American fury, happened to be visiting Britain. “Basically, they took back their country,” Mr. Trump said  Friday morning from Scotland, where he was promoting his golf courses. “That’s a good thing. ” Asked where public anger was greatest, Mr. Trump said: “U. K. U. S. There’s plenty of other places. This will not be the last. ” Even as the European Union began to grapple with a new and potentially destabilizing period of political uncertainty, the British vote also will inevitably be seized upon as further evidence of deepening public unease with the global economic order. Globalization and economic liberalization have produced winners and losers  —   and the big “Leave” vote in economically stagnant regions of Britain suggests that many of those who have lost out are fed up. Time and again, the European Union has navigated political crises during the past decade with a    response that has maintained the status quo and the bloc’s lumbering forward momentum toward greater integration  —   without directly confronting the roiling public discontent beneath the surface. But now the question is whether the dam has broken: Before breakfast on Friday,   leaders in France and the Netherlands were rejoicing and demanding similar referendums on European Union membership. “Victory for liberty!” declared the   French leader Marine Le Pen, writing on Twitter, who changed her profile picture to an image of the Union Jack. From its outset, the European Union was a project of elites, one that, at times, moved forward without a clear popular mandate from the masses. Adopting the common currency was deeply controversial in some places, including Germany. The issue of democratic legitimacy has always hung over the unification project, since many significant steps were achieved through treaties that stirred considerable resistance in some countries. European unity remained popular, particularly as the bloc delivered undeniable economic and social progress. But the class frictions beneath the project worsened in the past decade, as the European economy has been battered by recession and an uneven recovery. It is not clear whether the message is getting through to more establishment leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, or what lessons they are taking from the shock of the British exit. Perhaps the liberal Democrats in the House who staged a clamorous   Wednesday night in Washington, while part of the system themselves, were channeling the populist anger of the American left in their willingness to break the rules to make a point about the need for gun control. In Brussels, many member governments appear divided between an instinct to respond to the British referendum vote by driving for greater integration among Germany, France and other core members of the bloc and a willingness to moderate their ambitions in recognition of public opposition. European leaders were under pressure to reassure the European public, and the world, that the bloc was not at risk of unraveling. For decades, the European Union had moved forward, always expanding in size and influence. Britain has now reversed that trend. “We’re completely in uncharted territory,” said Hans Kundnani, a   expert in European politics at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Mr. Kundnani said the British vote exposed a contradiction at the core of the European project. European leaders define success as steering member states toward greater political and economic integration. And many of the bloc’s inefficiencies and dysfunctions can be traced to the unfinished work of strengthening European institutions and achieving greater integration between member states in areas such as banking, finance, security and defense. But public opinion is deeply skeptical of this “more Europe” agenda.   populist leaders have stoked public anxieties and resurgent nationalism by lashing out against immigrants, while portraying the European capital, Brussels, as a bastion of political elites out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.   populists have demanded a   of the neoliberal economics of free trade and limited regulation, while resisting efforts to deconstruct the social democratic welfare state. “The E. U. robs us of our money, our identity, our democracy, our sovereignty,” said Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch   Party for Freedom. “The elites want more E. U. They think they know better than the people. They look down on the people and want to decide in their place. They want us to be ruled by undemocratic, unaccountable bureaucrats in a faraway place like Brussels. ” And permeating everything is the weak Continental economy and the crippling debt burden across Southern Europe. “The E. U. is kind of trapped,” Mr. Kundnani said. “On the one hand, the instinct will be to move ahead with further integration and reassure the rest of the world that the European Union is not unraveling. But that is very difficult because of the fault lines that exist. ” He added: “They are trapped because moving ahead is very difficult. Moving backwards is the last thing they want to do. And the status quo is unsustainable. ” Britain has always been a skeptical member of the European household. During the 1990s, Britain chose to keep the pound and not to join the countries sharing a common European currency, the euro. Many of the British concerns about the euro proved true, undermining the bloc’s credibility, even as Britain has remained mostly insulated against the Continent’s still unresolved euro crisis. Before the referendum, some European officials portrayed Britain as an idiosyncratic case that should not be seen as a bellwether for the Continent. But that is a hard argument to make. In France, Ms. Le Pen’s   National Front party is experiencing steadily rising popularity as the country prepares for national elections next year. In Germany, the   Alternative for Germany polled strongly in recent state elections.   leaders in Hungary and Poland are hostile to immigrants, while critics say the governments of those countries are also rewriting national laws to undermine democratic checks and balances. In Italy, the   Five Star Movement scored major victories last Sunday by winning mayoral elections in Turin and, more important, in the capital, Rome. Donald Tusk, one of the European Union’s top leaders, has started to talk about the risks facing the political establishment. At a speech last month before Europe’s coalition of   political parties, Mr. Tusk cautioned his fellow political elites. “Obsessed with the idea of instant and total integration, we failed to notice that ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our ” said Mr. Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of all the 28 member states in the bloc. “Disillusioned with great visions of the future, they demand that we cope with the present reality better than we have been doing until now. ” Yet taking action may be difficult, since most analysts say the European Union is paralyzed by the coming national elections in 2017 in France and Germany, the two most powerful countries in the bloc. Neither the French nor the German government is eager to endorse sweeping initiatives for more European integration before the elections out of fear of a populist whipping at the polls. “Europe is very divided and the main European country, Germany, has no will or skills to lead the union  —   and is approaching important national elections,” said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes. “France is a country in crisis, while Italy has its own problems. I can’t see who would assume a European leadership capable of producing a deeper integration process. ” He added: “There is a very widespread rejection of politics everywhere. There is a similar mood in the United States, an antipolitical sentiment. ” Few industries in Britain are likely to be more directly hit than the financial services industry in London. Damon Hoff, a hedge fund manager, said that he had voted to stay in the European Union, but that he understood the sentiments of those who had voted to leave. “Europeans don’t feel more prosperous,” he said. “Europeans don’t feel more empowered. And certainly the British don’t. ” He added: “You want to be part of something that continuously evolves. Does the European Union feel like it is evolving? No. ”",-1.0
"Guantanamo Bay Naval Station Fast Facts.  (CNN) Here’s a look at Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and its detention facilities. Facts:The base, sometimes referred to as ”Gitmo,” is located in southeastern Cuba, on the coast of Guantánamo Bay.  The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a   border with Cuba.  The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement.  Detention Facilities:In response to the   attacks in 2001, and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan, existing migrant detention facilities at Guantánamo were repurposed to hold detainees in the ”war on terror.”  During the administration of President George W. Bush ( ) the United States claimed that Guantánamo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution, and that ”enemy combatant” status meant they could be denied some legal protections. Shortly after his inauguration in 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facilities within one year. However, the facilities are still open as of 2017. There are 41 detainees at Guantánamo Bay as of January 2017. More than 700 detainees have been held at Guantánamo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. At least nine detainees have died in custody. The US Defense Department spent about $445 million to run Guantánamo Bay in 2015, down from $522. 2 million in 2010.   Timeline:1903   The new Republic of Cuba leases 45 square miles of land in Guantánamo Bay to the United States for construction of a naval station. Building on the naval station begins that same year. 1934   Cuba and the United States sign a perpetual lease that rents the 45 square miles of Cuba to the US for $4, 085. 00 a year.  1991   Approximately 34, 000 Haitian refugees are detained on the base after they flee a coup in Haiti.      More than 55, 000 Cubans and Haitians captured at sea are kept at Guantánamo. January 11, 2002   The first detainees from Afghanistan and Pakistan arrive at the temporary facility of Camp  . June 28, 2004   A divided Supreme Court rules that the Guantánamo detainees have some rights but leaves open how these rights will be exercised. January 18, 2005   The Supreme Court refuses to consider whether the government’s plan for military trials unfairly denies the detainees basic legal rights. July 13, 2005   A report presented to the Senate Armed Services details the interrogation of the suspected ”20th hijacker” in the   attacks, Mohamed  . He was forced to wear a bra, dance with a man and do dog tricks while tied to a leash. But military investigators said that was not considered prohibited, inhumane treatment.  April 19, 2006   Following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Associated Press, the Pentagon releases the most detailed and extensive list of detainees ever provided. It provides the names and nationalities of 558 detainees who’ve gone through a hearing at Guantánamo Bay. May 15, 2006   The Defense Department releases another list of current and former detainees to the AP. It says this list of 759 names includes everyone who has ever been held at Gitmo, since 2001. The list does not include the names of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or Ramzi bin al Shibh. June 10, 2006   Three detainees, Ali Abdullah Ahmed, Mani     Utaybi, and Yassar Talal   are found dead in their cells by guards after apparently committing suicide.   June 29, 2006   The Supreme Court strongly limits the power of the US government to conduct military tribunals for suspected terrorists imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay. The   ruling effectively means officials will either have to come up with new procedures to prosecute at least 10 ”enemy combatants” awaiting trial, or release them from military custody.   September 6, 2006   President Bush acknowledges that the CIA has held suspected terrorists in secret prisons overseas. He announces the transfer of 14 captured al Qaeda operatives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al Shibh, and Abu Zubaydah, to Gitmo.   January 9, 2007   Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says that he expects Australian citizen David Hicks to be charged ”within a matter of weeks.” Hicks has been detained without charges at Guantánamo Bay since January 12, 2002. March 12, 2007   Walid Muhammad Salih bin Attash, a detainee at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, admits to helping orchestrate the bombings of the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. March 15, 2007   During a military hearing, a transcript of  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessing to being the mastermind of the   attacks is released.   May 30, 2007   A Saudi detainee is found dead from an apparent suicide.  June 5, 2008   Alleged   conspirators Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al Shibh, Ali Abd   Ali, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed   are arraigned.  June 12, 2008   The US Supreme Court rules   that detainees have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions. July 21, 2008   Salim Hamdan pleads not guilty at the opening of the first war crimes trial at Guantánamo Bay. He’s charged with transporting Osama Bin Laden and some missiles in connection with terrorist activity. August 6, 2008   Salim Hamdan is found guilty of five counts of material support to a terror organization. He is later sentenced to five years and six months in prison.  December 7, 2008   Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al Shibh, Ali Abd   Ali, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed   tell a judge that they want to make a full confession.  January 20, 2009   On his inauguration day, President Barack Obama directs Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ask prosecutors to seek stays for 120 days so terrorism cases at Guantánamo can be reviewed. January 22, 2009   President Obama signs an executive order to close Guantánamo Bay within a year. November 13, 2009   Attorney General Eric Holder announces that five detainees, accused of complicity in the September 11th attacks, will be transferred to New York City to stand trial in a civilian court. They are: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al Shibh, Walid bin Attash, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa Ahmed  .

"Axelrod: Why Trump says crazy things.  (CNN) It’s hard to believe, as some have suggested, that Donald Trump wants to lose his campaign for the presidency. After all, his entire   brand and message are built around one word: ”Winner.” Yet if Trump were plotting to throw this race, he would not have behaved any differently than he has for the past six days. Starting with his gratuitous and disturbing slap at Ghazala Khan, the Gold Star mother who appeared at the Democratic National Convention, Trump has been careening from one unsettling comment to another.   Among them, he appeared to defend Russia’s annexation of Crimea, suggested the election might be ”rigged,” booted a baby from a rally, joked about getting the Purple Heart the easy way and petulantly refused to endorse two leading Republicans    House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain    against minor primary opponents. All of this came as Hillary Clinton and the Democrats concluded a   convention week in which a succession of speakers lifted up the former secretary of state and serially painted the portrait of Trump as unhinged and dangerous. ”A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,” Clinton said in her acceptance speech, capturing in one line mounting fears about Trump’s temperament and preparedness. Trump’s binge of bombast in the wake of the Democratic convention only seemed to authenticate the argument Clinton and others had been making against him. And the furor over his peevish   outbursts led several prominent Republicans to disavow him, perhaps easing the way for others to follow. ”I’m an American before I’m a Republican,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Iraq War veteran and military reservist, told Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s ”The Situation Room.” ”I’m saying for me personally, how can I support that? Because he’s crossed so many red lines that a commander in chief or a candidate for commander in chief should never cross.” In just the past week, two other Republican House members, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Richard Hanna of New York, have come out against Trump’s candidacy. So have Republican business executive and   Meg Whitman and Marc Racicot, a former Montana governor and Republican National Committee chairman. There will surely be others between now and November. There are still 96 days to go, an eternity in politics. And Clinton carries her own   political burdens.  But, as I said years ago, presidential races are like MRIs for the soul. Whoever you are, people come to know you.  Republican leaders had hoped that their tempestuous and improvisational   would emerge from the convention with a new focus and discipline. Instead, something has been further exposed in Trump. The erratic and   reactivity and cavalier disregard of basic facts that we have seen throughout the year have come into even sharper relief these past few days.  That quality is unlikely to recede as the pressures of the campaign inexorably mount. So, no, I don’t believe Trump is throwing tantrums to ”throw the race.” I don’t think, as some elites have speculated, that he is acting out to avoid the awesome powers he subconsciously believes he is unprepared to hold.  Join us on Facebook. . This is who he is. Having thumbed his nose at the party establishment and ”political correctness” to win an improbable nomination, he simply is being true to himself and his supporters, responding to every provocation with full and indiscriminate fury that matches their anger at the political class. Trump’s challenge is that what thrilled the 13 million voters who made him the Republican nominee may already have disqualified him with the tens of millions more he would need to capture the presidency.",-1.0
"China Recruits Male Teachers To ‘Salvage Masculinity in Schools’ - Breitbart. Chinese education officials are aggressively recruiting male teachers to serve as assertive and “manly” role models to young boys as a means to counter the trend of increasing numbers of timid and effeminate young males. [Prompted by reports from Chinese news media of a need to “salvage masculinity in schools,” officials are seeing a   debate about gender equality and social identity just as government leaders are seeking a labor market that first rewards achievement and ability over fairness.  Sixth grade teacher Lin Wei, 27, one of few male teachers at the primary school level in Fuzhou, China, teaches, “Men have special duties. They have to be brave, protect women and take responsibility for wrongdoing,” reports the New York Times. China’s longstanding   policy has produced a population where boys far outnumber girls. Yet teachers are predominantly female and boys have consistently fallen behind in academic performance  —   with disparities in performance seen as early as third grade  —   causing concern for many parents who are now pressing for more assertive male role models in classrooms. The recruiting effort  —   that has included relaxing college admissions requirements and providing full scholarships with job guarantees to male applicants  —   has been labeled, by some, as “sexist. ” The effort to raise less effeminate boys is visible in Zhengzhou, where schools have asked boys to sign pledges to act like “real men. ” Similarly, in Shanghai, “boys only” classes for martial arts, computer repair, and physics are offered. Educators in Hangzhou have launched a summer camp —  called West Point Boys —  that offers taekwondo classes and touts the motto, “We bring out the men in boys. ” The backlash against the endeavor, however, has been heard. “If women go into architecture, shouldn’t the government give them a free education too?” Xue Rongfang, a student at Fujian Normal University, asked. “Why should men get this benefit?” Others deny the negative influence of a plethora of female teachers on boys. We have a more intuitive sense of children’s needs,” said Li Yue, 36, a kindergarten teacher in Fuzhou. “It isn’t the responsibility of schools to teach boys to be boys. It’s the responsibility of parents. ” Zhou Jiahao, 18, a senior at Shanghai No. 8 Senior High School, disagrees that China faces a masculinity crisis, but said boys feel more confident in   classes. “In classes with female students, we might not dare speak out,” he said. “When it’s just boys, we feel much freer. ” As the Times observes, wages are a problem in recruiting more male teachers. The average salary of a public school teacher in 2013 was approximately $17, 000. In addition to salary concerns, however, some young men express concern about perceptions that male teachers are not trustworthy and that the choice to become a teacher is an indication of homosexuality. Jiang Weiwen, 19, a university student, said friends and relatives wondered why he would choose a career in teaching. “They asked, ‘Why would a man want to be a teacher? ’” he said. “They think men should be ambitious, and that it’s so stable and bland to be a teacher. ”",1.0
"New South Korea leader Moon Jae-in willing to meet Kim in North. South Korea’s new president, Moon   has said he would be willing to go to North Korea to meet the country’s dictator, Kim   if it meant bringing lasting peace to the Korean peninsula. In an early sign of a clean break with the hardline approach of his conservative predecessors, Moon said he was prepared to travel the world to bring about a peaceful resolution to Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme. “I will quickly move to solve the crisis in national security,” Moon told the national assembly in Seoul after he was sworn in as successor to Park   who is awaiting trial on corruption and other charges after being impeached late last year. Moon, who won Tuesday’s election by a landslide, added: “I am willing to go anywhere for the peace of the Korean peninsula if needed. I will fly immediately to Washington, I will go to Beijing and I will go to Tokyo. If the conditions are right, I will go to Pyongyang. ” The former human rights lawyer said he would also “negotiate sincerely” with the US and China over the recent deployment of Thaad, a US missile defence system designed to thwart attacks by North Korea. Moon has vowed to review Thaad, which was installed in the South Korean countryside weeks before Tuesday’s election. China has urged the new president to scrap the system, claiming its powerful radar could be used to spy on its missiles. But Moon’s first actions as president will be more mundane than possible negotiations with Pyongyang. He must first choose a prime minister  —   who would then have to be approved by parliament  —   and make other senior appointments in an attempt to bring a semblance of stability to South Korean politics after months of uncertainty under a caretaker president. Moon, 64, a   liberal with a record of supporting engagement with North Korea, did not have the luxury of the usual   transition period afforded new South Korean presidents. The election was called after Park was impeached last year then arrested in March in connection with a corruption and abuse of power scandal involving her longtime confidante.  Park  —   whose father, the former dictator Park   imprisoned Moon while he was a student activist  —   left office months before her single   term was up, and faces life in prison if convicted. Moon, who had taken part in mass protests calling for Park’s dismissal, reached out to conservatives in the national assembly, where his Democratic party holds only 120 of the 300 seats. He praised the South Korean people for their “greatness” during months of political turbulence characterised by public anger directed at the political establishment and the heads of the country’s powerful chaebol conglomerates. “In face of the impeachment and arrest of an incumbent president, our people opened the path toward the future for the Republic of Korea,” said Moon, using the country’s formal title. Addressing his political opponents, he added: “We are partners who must lead a new Republic of Korea. We must put the days of fierce competition behind and hold hands marching forward. ” Later, during a customary visit to the national cemetery in Seoul, Moon wrote in the visitors’ book: “A country worth being proud of a strong and reliable president!” The US was among several countries to congratulate Moon. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the US looked forward to continuing to “strengthen the alliance” and “deepen the enduring friendship and partnership”. The Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, also sent congratulations. While Moon and Trump have voiced a willingness to meet Kim, the South Korean leader’s more conciliatory tone towards North Korea has prompted concern that any premature attempt to engage Pyongyang could anger hardliners in Washington. In response, Moon has committed to improving national security and has said he would be prepared to meet Kim only under certain conditions  —   most likely a pledge by North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes. As a former chief of staff under South Korea’s previous liberal president, Roh   Moon is expected to consider goodwill measures towards the North, including the reopening of the jointly run Kaesong industrial park and the resumption of aid. But analysts say he is unlikely to weaken sanctions or reduce diplomatic pressure, given the much higher risks presented by North Korea after a decade of nuclear tests and vast improvements in its missile technology. Seoul’s policy towards the North will change “substantially” according to Robert Kelly at Pusan National University, “but less substantially than many people on the South Korean left and Moon himself would like”. “That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t talk to North Korea,” Kelly said, adding that if Moon planned to resurrect the “sunshine policy” of engagement with Pyongyang, “he’s going to collide with the American government, where there is a pretty solid consensus right now that North Korea is a genuine global menace”. Moon faces similarly tough policy challenges at home, having vowed to build a fairer South Korea, where growing inequality and youth unemployment threaten the gains that turned the once   country into the world’s 11th largest economy. He will also come under pressure to honour a campaign pledge to rein in the power of the chaebol  —     companies that, in light of the Park scandal, are now seen as a symbol of the country’s domestic ills. Moon vowed to govern for all South Koreans, regardless of their political loyalties. “I will make a just, united country,” he said. “I will be a president who also serves all the people who did not support me. I will become a president who is at eye level with the people. ”",-0.5
"Here’s What We Know About The Senate GOP Health Care Bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Republicans will release a discussion draft of their version of the health care bill on Thursday, with a vote likely next week. Private health care talks have been underway in the Senate for weeks. McConnell tapped a   working group last month to hash out senators’ differences over the   American Health Care Act. McConnell’s office has since taken the lead drafting the Senate version of the party’s   legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have been coy  —   or simply out of the loop  —   on the specifics in the Senate plan, but here is what we know about what might be in the bill and where it could be headed: It Sounds A Lot Like The House Bill, After the House passed AHCA in early May, leading senators asserted that the Senate would go their own way. ”We’re writing a Senate bill and not passing the House bill,” Sen. Lamar Alexander,  . said then. ”We’ll take whatever good ideas we find there that meet our goals.” In the end, those goals appear to be aligned. The structure of the Senate bill, as described by GOP senators and aides, appears fundamentally the same as the   plan. The Senate bill is also expected to repeal the individual mandate and all or most of the ACA’s taxes, phase out the Medicaid expansion as well as change how the Medicaid program is funded, establish a system of tax credits to help people buy insurance if they choose, and make it easier for states to   of the ACA’s mandates for preexisting conditions and minimum insurance coverage mandates. There will be changes. For instance, the Senate version is expected to include more generous tax credits to make sure older, poorer Americans don’t get hit with higher costs. Republicans are also battling over how best to remake the Medicaid program, with key vote senators like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia sounding skittish about Medicaid reductions. Other Republicans are excited by the bill. Sen. John Barrasso,  . has been one of the most vocal advocates for Obamacare repeal. ”People didn’t want to have to buy this product. This is a sinking ship, people are ready to jump off,” he said Tuesday. Republicans like Barrasso see the bill as a win for the GOP and for the promises they made on the campaign trail. ”We eliminate the individual mandate. You’ll see more people as free citizens making a decision to not have Obamacare insurance, but certainly have more freedom,” Barrasso said. The Process Stinks, ”Can you say it was done openly? With transparency and accountability? Without backroom deals and struck behind closed doors? Hidden from the people? Hell no you can’t! Have you read the bill? Have you read the reconciliation bill? Have you read the manager’s amendment? Hell no you haven’t!” That’s not Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in 2017, that was former Minority Leader John Boehner in 2010 before House Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act. Republicans vilified Democrats seven years ago for negotiating the final details of Obamacare behind closed doors. Today Senate Republicans’ response could be: We learned it from watching you. The Senate has not held any public hearings on their health care bill (the House did) senators involved in the talks have been   on the substance, and the public will only have a few days to see it before it gets a vote. McConnell brushed off questions about transparency. ”They’ll have plenty of time,” he told reporters Tuesday. ”We’ve been discussing all the elements of this endlessly for seven years. Everybody pretty well understands it. Everybody will have adequate time to take a look at it.” That argument rings hollow with some of his fellow Republicans. ”We used to complain like hell when the Democrats ran the Affordable Care Act. Now, we’re doing the same thing,” Sen. John McCain,  . told CNN. ”If you’re frustrated in the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration,” Sen. Mike Lee,   said in a Facebook video for his constituents. Lee is a part of the   working group, but he said he hasn’t seen the draft bill. ”I just haven’t been able to see it yet and as far as I know the overwhelming majority of my colleagues haven’t been able to see it either.” Failure Is An Option, McConnell has been quietly leading Republicans’ to a vote next week but that doesn’t mean it’s going to pass. ”We’re going to make every effort to pass a bill that dramatically changes the current health care law,” McConnell said when asked if he has the votes. ”I think the leader has made it pretty clear we’re going to vote, one way or another, and hopefully we’ll have 50 votes when that time comes,” Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune said when asked if he believed McConnell would bring a bill to the floor that didn’t have the votes to pass. While no Republican senator has yet come out opposed the bill, McConnell has only a   margin of error with many senators voicing problems with the legislation. ”If our bill comes in with greater subsidies than Obamacare, it makes it hard for conservatives to support a bill that actually has greater subsidies than Obamacare,” Sen. Rand Paul,  . told reporters in regards to the tax credits in the GOP plan. ”That for me is a nonstarter.” Conservatives like Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee have Utah have been skeptical about the bill’s ability to ultimately lower premium costs for Americans. Both are seen as potential ’no’ votes on the bill. More moderate senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are also seen as potential ’no’ votes on the other end of the spectrum. Defeat of the   bill wouldn’t necessarily end the health care debate in Congress, but it would redefine it. Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson hinted at what that would look like at a constituent event last Friday. ”I’m not sure if we’re going to come up with 50 votes with a Republican solution. Let’s stabilize the markets and then,   work with the Democrats colleagues to actually fix the healthcare system,” Johnson said. The White House Doesn’t Love It  —   Yet, The White House has maintained a light tough when it comes to shaping the policies in the health care bill, but President Trump reportedly told a group of senators last week that the bill passed in the House was ”mean” and he wanted the final bill to do more to help needier Americans. On Tuesday, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president ”wants a bill that has heart in it” but did not offer any specific policies Trump wants in the bill. Spicer also said he didn’t know if the president had seen a draft of the Senate bill. If the Senate approves a bill next week, it still has more hurdles to go. The House either needs to pass the Senate bill   and send it to Trump’s desk, or the House and Senate have to go into a third round of negotiations in which both chambers would have to vote again on a final, compromise bill. Either way, the health care debate is likely to continue into July if the Senate can pass a bill next week. Democrats Debate How Far To Take Their Fight, Senate Democrats can’t filibuster the bill because it’s protected under special budget rules and only requires a majority vote. They’re all going to oppose it, but they can’t ultimately stop it from eventually getting an    vote. Democrats have started a series of protests this week that could intensify as the Senate approaches that vote. They held the floor Monday evening for a series of speeches in opposition to the bill. On Tuesday, they invoked a rule to block any committee hearings from taking place that afternoon to draw attention to their opposition to the health care bill. Outside Democratic activists associated with Indivisible are calling for Democrats to use every procedural tactic available to slow down debate. Since amendments are unlimited on a bill like this, one activist has even called on Democrats to introduce 40, 000 amendments to keep the Senate on the bill through the 2018 midterms. It’s unclear how Democrats will respond next week, but Schumer said Republicans should expect a fight. ”If Republicans won’t relent and debate their health care bill in the open for the American people to see, then they shouldn’t expect business as usual in the Senate,” Schumer said in a statement. NPR congressional reporters Scott Detrow and Geoff Bennett contributed to this report.",-0.5
"Daniel Horowitz: There Is a Fifth Column in the American Government - Breitbart. Asked by Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon if there is “essentially a fifth column in the national security and homeland security apparatus of the United States,” Daniel Horowitz, senior editor at Conservative Review, said, “Oh yeah, this is nothing new. It started pretty much in the second term of the Bush administration. ”[Horowitz continued:  There’s something called CVE, Countering Violent Extremism. It’s not just an Orwellian term to expunge any mention of Islamic terror and make it about a kind of generic extremism, including so called Right Wing extremism it’s a term of art. It is a very specific term concocted by the Muslim Brotherhood front groups like CAIR. They have successfully introduced this lexicon in our DHS [Department of Homeland Security]. These people are most commonly found in the Homeland Security Advisory Council, as well as the civil rights and civil liberties division of DHS. Breitbart News recently highlighted the issue with a piece drawn from a Horowitz item at Conservative Review, “The GOP’s Muslim     Agenda”: Next, Republicans could bring legislation to the House and Senate floors, finally designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group, thereby freeing up law enforcement do [sic] expunge them from our government and go after the mosques controlled by Brotherhood front groups. This would cut to the foundation of the radicalization problem inside Muslim communities in this country. It would also remove the Muslim Brotherhood foxes guarding the hen house within our sensitive counterterrorism advisory boards for the FBI and DHS. The bill designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group [H. R. 3892] already passed the House Judiciary Committee in February. But no. Republicans will have none of that. Instead, Republicans plan to package a bunch of nothingburger bills that, in   scenario, completely distracts from the core problem, and in the worst case, actually promotes the Muslim Brotherhood agenda. Horowitz’s interview on Breitbart News Daily Tuesday also highlighted: If you had a situation where there’s rampant, ubiquitous arson all over the country, and you find out it’s the firefighters committing the arson, and they’re everywhere, and they’re being cheered on, and then a group of people who are cheering them on successfully say, “You know what: we need to ban fire in your  kitchen. ” And they successfully make the narrative all that. This type of fire. What about fire for someone who’s mentally ill? And nobody is talking about the issues. We literally had a debate all of yesterday, and we’re going to have it all of today, probably for the rest of the week, about how much   …     how many people do we want to ban from getting a gun. Meanwhile, we are bringing the problem to our shores. A) Through immigration. Then once they’re here  —   and some of them have been here for several decades  —   we have the Muslim Brotherhood radicalizing them, writing their textbooks in their schools, obviously sympathizing with the terrorists, making these guys want to identify with them in the mosques and all the community centers. And then most importantly, or most egregiously, they are in every level of our counterterrorism and Homeland Security apparatus: DHS, FBI, State Department. Republicans, as their response to Orlando, they crafted legislation using the term Countering Violent Extremism, giving them more resources to further the goals and objectives of CVE. So they basically empowered Obama and legitimized this program. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. ",1.0
"WAR ON COPS: Houston-Area Deputy Constable Ambushed, Shot Multiple Times. A Harris County deputy constable was shot multiple times in what is being reported as an “absolute ambush. ” The attack occurred late Wednesday night and the deputy went under immediate surgery to save his life. It is unknown at this time whether the deputy constable will survive. Deputy Constable Alden Clopton is reportedly an   veteran of the Constable’s office. [A man matching the description of the alleged shooter walked up to a Houston fire station and turned himself in, KHOU CBS11 reported. The man has not been arrested or charged but is being questioned by police at this time. The man was not injured when he turned himself in. It is not known at this time why he walked into the fire station.  UPDATE: ABC13 reported that Deputy Clopton’s surgery has been completed and he is recovering in the critical care unit. Doctors decided not to remove the bullets but treated his wounds. “We think he is going to be okay,” Constable May Walker told reporters. “He’s a strong guy. ” Deputy Clopton was struck by bullets four times in the back. Two additional shots entered Clopton’s vehicle and one round went into the ground, officials reported. Local ABC13 reports: “His family is obviously in shock,” says Holland Jones, spokesman for the Constable’s Office. “Hopefully his family’s prayers will be answered. ” Investigators say around 11:20pm a reserve deputy with Precinct 7 and a full time deputy were wrapping up a traffic stop on Alabama Street when someone opened fire on them.

"Microsoft’s Slack competitor Teams launches today as a preview – TechCrunch. It’s been a busy Fall for Microsoft . A week after throwing a big Windows/Surface party, the software giant has returned to the Big Apple for its latest piece of news. Clearly the company was just too excited to keep its latest addition to Office 365 under wraps, posting a launch video just prior to the event’s official kickoff. Today’s event kicked off with that same video, after a few goofy jokes about feeling like “we were just here, last week.” CEO Satya Nadella hit the stage to talk about collaboration, the “art of the team,” as the company put it, citing the different ways different groups from orchestras to sports teams work differently. Introducing: #MicrosoftTeams pic.twitter.com/V3AyaXdVib — Microsoft Office News (@OfficeNews) November 2, 2016 Nadella describes Teams as, “a chat-based workspace…designed to facilitate real-time collaboration while building up the institutional knowledge of a team.” The application is designed to pull together various tools into a single platform, including pieces like meetings, notes, a planner and, of course, chat. As predicted, the app features threaded chats, keeping different conversations grouped together, along with a deep integration with Skype for voice and video calls built into the app. In fact, the company has built a number of its own offerings into the app, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Office 365 Groups forms the basis of the application, allowing users to share information across different apps. Customization is a big point here, as well, letting users design their own experience by way of cloud services built into tabs and Microsoft Bot integration. Sure, it’s a productivity application, but you’re not going to be able to compete with the likes of Slack without appealing to the millennial crowd, and, as such, the company is integrating things like emojis, stickers, GIFs and custom memes — however, that last bit should choose to manifest itself. Office Marketing CVP Kirk Koenigsbauer shares Microsoft’s vision to help people achieve more with #MicrosoftTeams. https://t.co/TNRCnO1A72 pic.twitter.com/whQiTc3Ojd — Microsoft Office News (@OfficeNews) November 2, 2016 Different non-chat functions are filled at the top in a series of tabs on the top dashboard, so users can flip between different information, be it stored notes in OneNote or graphs through BI. It’s a clean way to incorporate a large number of different information sources into a single place, without overwhelming one channel. The company showed off a few bots, as well, including T-Bot, which is a centralized help system that crawls an informational index, answering questions. Similarly, WhoBot searches people, so users can search for co-workers by asking contextual questions. Microsoft is launching the application across a spectrum of mobile platforms, as well, including iOS, Android and, naturally, Windows Phone. In the demo, the mobile version of the application is essentially a scaled-down version of the desktop version. Security has been built into the desktop and mobile offerings, including data encryption and compliance with standards like U Model Clauses, ISO 27001, SOC 2 and HIPAA. “Like all our commercial services,” the company explains in the official announcement, “we have a transparent operational model with no standing access to customer data.” The application is now available as a preview in 181 countries. It will be available to everyone in the first quarter of next year. Microsoft is also offering the app to third-party developers today. It’s already enlisted a number of high-profile platforms that will be available at launch, including Asana, Hootsuite and Zendesk. The application can also be set up to receive notifications from services like Twitter and GitHub.",0.0
"Rhode Island boarding school agrees to settlement in sexual abuse case. An elite boarding school in Rhode Island announced on Wednesday that it had agreed to a settlement to provide compensation for up to 30 former students over sexual abuse accusations. St George’s School, in Middletown, had been under fire for months over allegations that boys and girls were molested and raped over the course of decades, from the early 70s into the early 2000s, with leadership accused of covering up the abuse. Wednesday’s settlement comes about as a result of a pact between the school and a group representing the victims. “We have identified credible complaints against 12 individuals that worked at St George’s over a   period, and that’s a big number. That does not include    sexual abuse, either,” Eric MacLeish, a lawyer representing the victims, told the Guardian. The small school of fewer than 400 students in grades nine through 12 charges $56, 000 a year and was founded in 1896. It has an illustrious history of several famous attendees, such as members of the Astor and Vanderbilt dynasties, Prescott Bush, the father of president George HW Bush, poet Ogden Nash and, more recently, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean. But last year, former student Anne Scott came forward to say she had been systematically raped and threatened while at the school, beginning in 1979 at the age of 15, by the school’s athletic trainer, the late Al Gibbs, who was 65 at the time. When she later tried to sue in her 20s, the school targeted her so aggressively that she gave up, the Boston Globe reported, in a series of investigations into St George’s and abuse at other elite private schools across New England. On Wednesday Scott, who has been at the forefront of negotiations on behalf of victims in recent months, issued a statement thanking St George’s, saying: “It’s hard to put into words what it feels like to receive this kind of validation and support, after all these years. ” The amount of the financial settlement has not been disclosed and awards to individual claimants will be decided by Paul Finn, a   Boston mediator and arbitrator who has helped settle claims in the infamous Catholic priest sex abuse scandal in Boston, as well as in other cases involving schools. MacLeish has also represented hundreds of victims in the Boston archdiocese scandal. “Many people don’t understand how   child sex abuse can be. This is something that changes your life forever, many survivors have an inability to trust, go through multiple divorces, substance abuse, its effect is profound,” MacLeish said. The current principal of St George’s, Eric Peterson, who has been in place since 2004, has faced calls for his resignation, is accused of shielding abusers and covering up previous cases of abuse even before he joined the school.  Peterson said in June he will step down when his contract ends next year. After much wrangling, the school commissioned independent counsel to conduct an investigation into past sexual abuse problems and that report is expected in  . Leslie Heaney, chair of the St George’s board of trustees, issued a statement on Wednesday, saying: “It is our sincere hope that this agreed resolution will assist our survivors as they move forward towards healing. ” MacLeish said his clients had suffered in silence for decades. “Then the truth comes out,” he said. Rhode Island state police led a   criminal investigation last year that did not result in any charges.  Some accused staff are dead and other cases are too old to prosecute, MacLeish said. But “there is still potential” for future prosecutions, he said. Wednesday’s settlement does not gag any of the complainants, but will preclude them from now suing the school. MacLeish said that parents who sent their children to a highly regarded boarding school expected them to be safe. But for staff and senior students wanting to prey on vulnerable girls and boys, “what better place to do this than a boarding school?” MacLeish said. MacLeish said the negotiations leading up to the settlement were “an unusual process” but that, after years of painful arguments, it had been remarkable in its lack of “chest thumping and fighting”.  He was confident the school now reflects a culture that can properly deal with its history of abuse and believes St George’s is also safe for current and future students.",-0.5
"Opinion: My First-Nations Identity Feels More Like An Absence. As a child in elementary school, I hoped that my   heritage would give me supernatural abilities like uncommon tracking skills. Many Native sidekicks in movies and TV seemed to have the power to discern in the smallest detail what had passed their way. I remember sitting on a large yellow carpet with my classmates, convinced that I could sense when our teacher was about to return from the bathroom. It has taken a lot of growth to free myself from the superficial fantasies and   anxieties about what it means to be First Nations. For too long, those fantasies ensnared me thanks to the images of Native peoples belonging only in the past or on reservations, dead or in poverty. My identity is complicated by the fact that I have the privilege of passing for white, which means that I am never a direct target of interpersonal racism or ever suspected by colleagues as having ”an agenda” when I introduce Native voices into my   classroom. My   heritage, Oneida, which is part of the Iroquois Confederacy, comes from my paternal grandfather Leslie Roy ”Big Jim” Doxtdator. The Canadian government recognizes me as a status Indian under its Indian Act, which for generations stripped legal status from Indian women who married white men. (Before I could comfortably start writing this essay, I searched the house for my status card, which makes me legally Indian in Canada for five years at a time.) When I left Canada, I never renewed it, and it now sits in my wallet, of no use to me in Belgium, where I have lived and worked for the past five years. While I feel very geographically detached from my family, I hadn’t much thought about the nomadic history of First Nations people when I moved overseas. It turns out that my Oneida ancestors, after New York State reduced their lands from six million to a few hundred acres, moved to Ontario in the 1840’s and bought their settlement on the Thames River near London. My more distant Oneida ancestors were betrayed by broken treaties, which didn’t stop many   peoples from fighting in the World Wars only a few generations later. Both of my grandfathers, Big Jim and Harry Edwards, of Welsh descent, passed through Belgium on their way to liberate Holland and Germany. In his war records, one lieutenant described Big Jim as ”a better than average Indian lad.” While at times I feel disconnected from my   roots, too often I lose sight of the interconnections that I have through my family. My father worked as a probation officer for youth for over three decades, and many of his charges were from the Six Nations reserve in Canada. Though he never really talks about it, I know he helped a lot of people. I remember travelling to a school for a basketball game when I was in 9th grade. Someone from the other team came up to me and said, ”Hey, I recognized you. Your dad has a picture of you on his desk.” I waited to hear something menacing, but instead he said, ”Your dad’s helped me stay out of detention and in school.” I am thankful for what my family made me, but my personal nomadic story is nothing like that of my ancestors. After studying philosophy in college, I fell into teaching it at an alternative high school in Toronto. In my first year, I got it all wrong. Quite simply, I took some contemplative questions, started way back near the beginning, possibly with Socrates, and traced the debate up through the present. (”What’s knowledge? What’s justice? What’s truth? Now, let’s hear what John Locke has to say. ”) Years of studying philosophy made me feel sure that I had a discerning and educated eye for the naive   in high school textbooks. For my course materials, I carefully read through my bookcases, selecting the most interesting and lively passages from great western male thinkers. Not only did I reproduce a syllabus full of mostly privileged white men, but I reproduced a syllabus filled with their questions, their writing styles, and their elevation of dispassionate logic above emotion. To my utter regret, it took years for me to recognize that once a dominant frame is applied to an issue an important operation of power has already transpired. And, as a teacher who is also First Nations, I was complicit because of how I prepared and carried out my lessons. My central mistake began as a  . Before I ever stepped into a classroom for the first time, I should have taken Aboriginal studies courses, spent time developing an educated eye for my culture, and sought out chances to connect with other   youth. I didn’t do any of that because I would have felt shame to enter the spaces where other First Nations people live and thrive and admit that I have no sense of my culture. In the classroom, I have started to break my reluctance to speak openly about my   roots because I want to clarify what stake I have in discussions about equity. But I feel more like I was hiding my ignorance of my roots than my roots themselves. But   students value it when teachers open up and become vulnerable, and increasingly I feel like I need to reciprocate since they share so much of themselves with me in their writing.   One of my favorite stories to teach, ”A Coyote Columbus Story” by Thomas King, features anachronisms, like Native people shopping and going on vacations before Columbus arrives, but it tells the often untold truth that Columbus kidnapped and sold Native people. The story both counters the familiar narrative that valorizes Columbus as a heroic explorer, and it also crosses the boundary that aligns realism with truth against the magical and fantastic. We restrict our imaginations when we go to trusted forms in search of comfortable meaning. My identity as First Nations and as a teacher build on one another. Reflecting on my past teaching mistakes has made me more reflective about who I am. Sure, part of teaching is a performance, pretending to be in a better mood than I am some days, being patient even when I face personal struggles. But the real work of teaching involves making the world, and myself, knowable to students. The last time I taught Thomas King’s story, my voice wavered near the end as we read it. Indigenous stories are ongoing, not simply legends from the past. I don’t want my students to have the distorted idea that   people have vanished or are not ”modern.” Not only do I live this truth, but increasingly realize that my life gives shape to this truth.

"Muirfield’s Mulligan, Allowing Female Members, Is a Grudging Blow to Bigotry - The New York Times. The Muirfield Golf Club took advantage of a mulligan, and, in its second vote in 10 months, straightened out enough of its wayward members to surpass the   majority needed to admit women. Tuesday’s victory was perhaps more about pragmatism than principles. Just over 80 percent of the men of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh, which runs Muirfield, determined that it is better to have to share membership privileges with the occasional woman than to be excluded from hosting a British Open. Of the 621 members who voted, 498 were in favor of admitting women. Last May, 616 members cast ballots, with fewer than 400, or 64 percent, voting for the resolution. Any inclination to warmly welcome the gentlemen of Muirfield into the 21st century is tempered by the fact that 123 members  —   even confronted with a boycott of their storied course by the Royal and Ancient, the organizer of the British Open  —   stubbornly thumbed their noses at what passes for progress in the rest of the civilized world by voting against admitting women. In their defense, the pace of change must be dizzying for those stuck in the era of   trousers, ruffled cravats and tweed jackets. For more than a century,  Muirfield had been able to welcome the world to its storied course while keeping women out, except as guests and visitors. Sixteen times, most recently in 2013, Muirfield managed to keep its discriminatory membership policy and host one of golf’s most prestigious championships, too. So it must have seemed like a bad dream when many gentlemen of Muirfield woke up one morning  —   got out of their marital beds to go play golf with their chums, as the former chief executive of the RA, Peter Dawson, so memorably described it in 2013  —   and realized that the ground beneath their feet had moved. It is proof of the seismic shifts remaking the glacial game of golf that in a matter of a few years, Muirfield went from being too famed a course to leave out of the British Open rotation to being too fetid to include. Muirfield, formed in 1744, was one of the last clubs to host a major golf event to dig their heels in on membership. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews opened its membership to women in 2014. Royal St. George’s, another British Open site, followed suit a year later. Last year, Royal Troon ended its   membership policy  —   a few weeks before hosting the British Open. Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters, deserves credit for offering membership to women in 2012, however belatedly, and, in doing so, daring the rest of the heel diggers to fall in line behind it. Renee Powell, one of the first women offered membership to the Royal and Ancient, had a mixed reaction to Muirfield’s mulligan vote. “I’m delighted it passed, first of all,” she said Tuesday by telephone. “I’m also a little bit bewildered why anyone would vote against it. ” Pioneers like Powell have been joined in the fight by younger generations of men who seem as confused as anyone by the old guard’s intransigence. After last year’s voting results were announced, Rory McIlroy, a   major winner from Northern Ireland, expressed disbelief. It was hard for him to wrap his head around a host of the major he loves perhaps more than any other discriminating against women. On Tuesday, the reigning Masters champion Danny Willett, an Englishman, expressed delight in the voting reversal. “I think that’s great,” he said. “I think it shows how times have changed. It shows how golf’s changed. ” Muirfield’s waiting list for membership stretches at least two years, so women will have to keep a stiff upper lip  —   there will be no line jumping for history’s sake. It is hoped the club doesn’t follow the example of the Royal and Ancient and earmark for membership a couple of nonagenarian women who don’t have time on their side. After the vote was announced, the RA affirmed Muirfield would go back into the British Open rotation. The first Open that Muirfield could host is in 2022, and by then, it is hoped, its membership will include a handful of women. Twenty years from now, no one is likely to care that the gentlemen of Muirfield were grudging in their acceptance of women. It will be like the 74 that Willett posted in the second round last year at Augusta  —   a footnote to his   victory. Two decades on, when women are mingling with men in the golf clubs where access to power is one of the privileges of membership, few will remember that it wasn’t always like that. History is long, but collective memories, blessedly, are short. The next battleground is Kasumigaseki Country Club, which was chosen as the site of the men’s and women’s golf competition at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The club denies women full membership and prohibits them from playing on Sundays. In an interview with Reuters last month, the International Olympic Committee’s vice president, John Coates, said that if the club did not “achieve gender equality,” the Olympic competition would be moved to another course. One can argue that a club with discriminatory membership policies never should have been chosen as the host course in the first place. But as the RA demonstrated with Muirfield, the spotlight can be a powerful tool, starting conversations in which clubhouse politicking ends.",-1.0
"‘Outsider’ Candidates in 2016 Come from a Surprising Source: The Military. In 2016, voters are fed up with career politicians. This year, both Democratic and Republican congressional candidates are striving to cast themselves in opposition to the Washington establishment. Ironically, the majority of “outsider” candidates on the ballot in November will have a background in the military, which falls within the long list of government institutions that are the very core of the “establishment. ” It’s not hard to explain this apparent contradiction: According to a Gallup poll from June, 73 percent of people have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the military, while a mere 6 percent have any confidence in Congress. It seems that not every establishment institution is feeling the public’s wrath. In the aftermath of his primary victory against Wisconsin state senator Frank Lasee in the Badger State’s eighth congressional district, Republican candidate Mike Gallagher told National Review that “people are now profoundly concerned with the threat of radical Islam in particular, but also the rising threats in general. ” The fear of crime, particularly terrorism, has led the public to look for military and   experience in its House candidates. “People don’t feel safe anymore, not even in northeastern Wisconsin,” Gallagher said. In Michigan’s first congressional district,   Republican Jack Bergman is currently leading the chairman of the Michigan Democratic party in the polls, according to the Cook Political Report. Bergman’s campaign slogan is simple: “If you want change in Washington, send a Marine. I’ll get the job done!” All across the nation, veterans are staging   campaigns. Typical messages include: “We must break the Washington cartel this year” “I’m not a politician and I am certainly not a career politician” “I have been a successful doctor, veteran, businessman, and lawyer. I am not a politician, nor do I want to be” and “Make the decision to join the fight to take back Congress from the career politicians!” RELATED: The GOP’s Best Hope for Picking Up a Senate Seat: Joe Heck, The success of such rhetoric has led other,   candidates to hop on the bandwagon. Fran Person, the Democratic nominee in South Carolina’s fifth congressional district, played a critical role in Washington from 2009 to 2014 as the special assistant to Vice President Joe Biden. But you wouldn’t know it from Person’s website, which traffics heavily in   slogans: “Fran is running for Congress because Congress is broken. Members of Congress spend more time fighting with one another and scoring political points than working for us. That’s never going to work. ” More 2016 It’s Time to Move On from the 2016 ElectionHillary Blames America FirstHillary Says Voter Suppression Cost Her the ElectionJim Mowrer, the Democratic nominee in Iowa’s third district, doesn’t hide his achievements, including becoming Biden’s veterans’ director and serving as a Pentagon appointee under President Obama. But like Person, Mowrer attempts to create the perception that he is an outsider: “We need a congressman who will put the priorities of Iowans ahead of the Washington Insiders and party politics. ” As the     movement continues to garner support on both sides of the aisle, it seems that November’s elections might usher in a slate of “outsider” candidates who shift power from one facet of the establishment to another.,",1.0
"Japanese-Americans recall WWII prison camps.  (CNN) Actor and activist George Takei recalls the day his life changed forever. ”I remember myself as a    boy gazing out of the front window of our living room,” Takei said at a preview of an exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. ”I saw two soldiers marching up our driveway. They carried rifles with shiny bayonets on them.” Takei remembers being put on a rail car with other  . He was incarcerated with his family at the camps near Rohwer, Arkansas, and Tule Lake, California. ”I remember the barbed wire fences that confined us,” Takei said. ”I remember the tall sentry towers, with the guns pointed down at us. I remember the searchlights that followed me when I made the night runs from our barrack to the latrine.” Sunday marks the 75th anniversary of a dark chapter in American history    a moment when the country denied residents civil liberties, based solely on race and nationality. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. ”That executive order profoundly changed the lives of 120, 000 people,” Takei said. ”I was one of them.” The order paved the way for the forced removal and incarceration of people of Japanese descent,   of them US citizens. They were sent to remote prison camps and lost their homes, jobs and possessions. Anyone who had   Japanese ancestry was ordered into a camp. Exhibit reflects on executive order, The museum’s exhibit revisits that time in history. ”Instructions to All Persons: Reflections on Executive Order 9066” runs through August 13. The exhibit includes the original   order featuring Roosevelt’s signature, on loan from the National Archives. It will be on display for the first time on the West Coast.  ”This year’s Day of Remembrance commemorates the 75th anniversary of this historic miscarriage of justice, recognizing its continued relevance in today’s political climate and supporting civil and human rights for all,” the museum says on its website. Read a CNN producer’s personal story, The government called the mass arrests and imprisonment ”internment”    but the word does not capture the extent of the horror inflicted on them. Joyce   82, bristles at the word ”internment.” She was 7 when she was rounded up with her family.  ”We were citizens and put into a concentration camp,”   said. ”’Incarceration’ or ’imprisonment’ is better (to describe it). ’Internment’ is a euphemistic word promoted by the government to make it seem less harsh.” Pat Sakamoto, 72, was born at the Manzanar War Relocation Center, where her mother and toddler sister were imprisoned during the war. Sakamoto’s father, born in the United States, refused to sign a loyalty pledge to his country that was forcing him into a camp, so he was deported to Japan, a country he had never visited. ”My mother never had contact with him again, so I never met my biological father,” says Sakamoto. She said she stayed at the camp until November 1945. President Ronald Reagan signed legislation in 1988 that paid reparations to the   who were imprisoned. The legislation apologized for the government action, saying it was based on ”race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.” Troubled by Trump’s Policy, Sakamoto and others say they are troubled by President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, signed last month, that temporarily barred citizens from seven   countries from entering the United States. The president is vowing to roll out a new executive order next week that will be tailored to a federal court decision that blocked his travel ban. ”In some way, history is repeating itself,” Sakamoto said. ”I’m fearful for a lot of the Latinos and Muslims, because they are being sent back. It is because of what we look like    you could tell us from the white population.”   agreed.  ”It is absolutely wrong and against the Constitution to target one group of people and pass certain laws against that group,”   said. Takei said Trump’s executive order ”had the same animus and prejudice and ignorance” as the one signed by Roosevelt in 1942. ”But it is a different America today,” Takei added after noting the mass protests sparked by Trump’s order. ”I never thought I’d fight for any political thing but I feel I need to say something now,” said Sakamoto. ”My mother did what she was told to do. It makes me sad she couldn’t express how she felt. I need to be my mother’s voice.”",-1.0
"Why celebrities are skipping the Trump inauguration festivities.  (CNN) Donald Trump wants yuge celebrities to perform at his presidential inaugural events next month. In fact, Trump’s former campaign manager and now adviser Kellyanne Conway even made a plea on national TV a few weeks ago, asking Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars to call her to be part of the festivities. This week it was announced that the Radio City Rockettes will perform (though there are reports some are reluctant). As of now, none of the big name   celebrities are biting. And that’s a great thing.   Celebrities shouldn’t lend their fame to normalize or validate Trump’s history of racism, bigotry and sexism. And by being a part of his inauguration they would be doing just that. They would be saying it’s OK Trump demonized Latinos, Muslims and immigrants. They would be telling us they are cool with his sexist remarks and mocking of a disabled reporter. And that they are not disgusted by Trump bragging in the infamous ”Access Hollywood” tape about his sexually assaulting women and then publicly shaming the victims of his alleged sexual misconduct who had the courage to come forward.  But for some on the right, like Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, these celebrities aren’t saying no to Trump’s inauguration because they are personally repulsed by Trump’s history of hate. Rather, as O’Reilly claimed on his show Wednesday night, the real reason celebrities aren’t signing on to the Trump inaugural festivities is because ”some very powerful entertainment people in America do not want the Trump inauguration to be a   event.”   O’Reilly even alleged that ”veiled threats” have been made and that performers are ”scared that they will lose work if they show up.”   To O’Reilly, this is just another example of how progressives refuse to accept a Republican president. But O’Reilly is dead wrong.   This is neither a Democratic versus Republican nor conservative versus liberal issue. It’s specific to Trump. He’s not a mainstream Republican who some on the left have policy disagreements with on key issues. Rather, Trump is unique    he’s a person whose campaign trafficked in hate. In fact, when Republican George W. Bush was inaugurated president in 2001, he didn’t have a problem securing stars to be a part of his inaugural event. Rather, a bevy of   stars were a part of his inaugural festivities, including Destiny’s Child    which at the time included Beyoncé    as well as other big names of the day, including Ricky Martin, Jessica Simpson and country stars like Clint Black and Lyle Lovett. True, President Obama had bigger names at his 2009 inaugural events, such as U2, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder, but Bush’s list was still impressive.  And in 2005, Bush’s second inaugural attracted a racially diverse list of   celebrities, including Gloria Estefan, Kelsey Grammer and 2003 ”American Idol” winner Ruben Studdard.  The difference between Bush and Trump is clear: Bush didn’t run a campaign that demonized minorities and women. Trump did. And O’Reilly’s claim that ”powerful entertainment people” are preventing celebrities from being a part of the Trump festivities is like so much of what Fox News broadcasts in prime time:  . O’Reilly offered zero evidence to support his claim that some nefarious groups of Hollywood executives are threatening celebrities to stay away from Trump’s inauguration. If conservatives truly were being blacklisted by ”powerful entertainment people” then why do we see Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Gary Sinise, and a long list of other outspoken conservatives working successfully in Hollywood. It’s also interesting that none of these people were at the Republican National Convention this year, instead we saw only the likes of Scott Baio and Antonio Sabato Jr. And from a business point of view, keep in mind Trump received almost 63 million votes, that’s a lot of people to sell your wares to if you saddle up to Team Trump. Yet, still many celebrities are saying no to Trump despite the potential economic upside. Just so it’s clear, I’m not nor is anyone to my knowledge calling for celebrities to boycott Trump’s inaugural events. It should be a decision based on the conscience of each individual. But to those stars who say no to Trump, many Americans commend you for refusing to be a part of festivities to honor a man who utilized hate to elevate himself to the highest office in the land.",-1.0
"Milo Yiannopoulos Leads Emory Students on ’Chalkening’ Crusade Around Campus - Breitbart. On Wednesday night, in front of a packed auditorium at Emory University, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke about feminism, political correctness, and perhaps the most significant campus free speech controversy of the year. [Unlike the rest of the stops on “The Dangerous Faggot Tour,” Yiannopoulos’ visit to Emory was in response to a specific free speech incident that took place on the campus. Just a few weeks ago, Emory descended into chaos after a group of student protesters occupied an administration building and demanded that the Emory president, James W. Wagner, condemn Donald Trump on behalf of the university.  The demonstration was in response to the appearance of several   chalk writings around campus that protesters claimed created an unsafe environment for students. The student protesters also claimed that they were scared and “in pain” over the chalk writings, and demanded that the university hold responsible the students guilty of the Trump endorsement. Although Wagner allowed the student protesters to address their concerns in March, he wholly rejected their demand days later  —   taking to a prominent sidewalk on campus and writing, “Emory stands for free expression,” in chalk.  On Wednesday night, several hundred Georgians showed up at White Hall to hear Milo’s take on Emory’s chaos. Although a few student protesters showed up with posters to chant outside of the auditorium, their presence was dwarfed by a significant number of students wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and carrying “Socialism sucks” signs. White Auditorium at Emory University wasn’t enough to contain the students who came out to see Yiannopoulos on Wednesday night. About a dozen students were lined up at the door, just so that they might get the chance to see Yiannopoulos on his way out of the auditorium. For those who wished to watch the lecture, but weren’t able to get a seat, a live video feed of the event was played in a nearby classroom.  Yiannopoulos spoke for approximately 25 minutes before turning to students for questions. Students asked about political correctness, feminism, and Donald Trump. Perhaps the most significant portion of Milo’s visit to Emory came after his lecture, when he lead students outside into the nearby Asbury Circle section of campus to chalk up the sidewalks.  Milo led students out of the lecture hall and through campus, settling into Asbury Circle, where he initiated the demonstration by writing “Dangerous Faggot” in the center of the circle. Students were encouraged to write whatever they wanted. Although most of the sidewalk received   messages, others went the other way, with one student writing “f**k Milo. ”  Despite a student protester’s insistence that “words can be violent,” no one was harmed by the chalk writings placed around Emory’s campus on Wednesday night. Emory’s social justice warriors may now realize that free expression isn’t as harmful as they might have thought. Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

"The College Dorm and the Confederacy.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF A Tennessee college will remove a controversial inscription from one of its dormitories, returning an    donation for the construction of the building. The chancellor of Vanderbilt University, Nicholas Zeppos, announced Monday the school would remove “Confederate Memorial Hall,” the name engraved in the stone above the main entrance of a residence hall. Zeppos called the inscription a “symbol of exclusion” in a statement to the university, a private undergraduate and graduate college in Nashville. “It spoke to a past of racial segregation, slavery, and the terrible conflict over the unrealized high ideals of our nation and our university, and looms over a present that continues to struggle to end the tragic effects of racial segregation and strife,” Zeppos said. The dorm will be renamed Memorial Hall, the name that has been used in all campus housing assignments, websites, maps and other materials for more than a decade, according to the school.  Vanderbilt will return $1. 2 million to the Tennessee chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the present value of the $50, 000 the group donated to the school in 1933 for the construction of the dorm. The United Daughters of the Confederacy is a national organization of female descendants of Confederate soldiers who fought in the Civil War. Back then, the dorm was part of the George Peabody College for Teachers, an independent institution that merged with Vanderbilt in 1979, according to the school. The inscription has been in place since the dorm’s construction in 1935. The payment complies with a 2005 court ruling in the state. In 2002, Vanderbilt tried to rename the building and drop the inscription, but the Tennessee branch United Daughters of the Confederacy sued the school, arguing it was breaching a contract. A Tennessee appeals court ruled the school could only remove the inscription if it returned the 1933 donation to the group at its value in current dollars. But “Vanderbilt chose to use those funds . .. for other purposes rather than enrich an organization whose values it does not share,” the school said.  The $1. 2 million payment will come from anonymous donors who gave specifically for the removal of the inscription, the school said.  Various institutions, public and private, in the United States have reconsidered and removed Confederate references and imagery in the last year, most in response to the mass shooting of members of a historically black church in Charleston in June 2015, perpetrated by a gunman who had posed with the battle flag in pictures before the rampage. The Confederate flag was removed from South Carolina’s statehouse a month after the shooting, and lawmakers in some southern cities voted to take down Confederate memorials within their borders. Last August, the University of Texas removed a bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, that had stood on campus since 1933.",-0.5
"Trump's dark view of North Korea options. Forget DACA or tax reform. One topic consumes the vast majority of President Trump's inner circle: North Korea. Contrary to the president's breezy tweet this morning, in which he refers to Kim Jong-un as ""Rocket Man,"" top administration officials have a dark view of how this plays out. They believe the confrontation with Pyongyang's portly dictator will define Trump's first term in office. The consensus view among Trump, Mattis and McMaster, according to several officials briefed on their thinking, is that this conflict is heading towards two options, both with high risks: escalated confrontation with China and the military option. 1. Direct pressure on China: Administration officials believe it will take intense financial sanctions and tariffs to pressure the Chinese to do a lot more to choke off the North Korean economy. The Chinese insist in private they don't have has much clout as the U.S. thinks. The Trump administration thinks that's nonsense. Officials are waiting to see how the latest United Nations sanctions agreement affects North Korean behavior, but if the regime keeps firing rockets and testing nukes, watch for escalated tension with China. Especially over Beijing's refusal to stop exporting oil to North Korea — a remaining pressure point that's preoccupying Trump's national security team. 2. The military option(s): If pressure on China fails and North Korea gets close to having a nuclear missile that can hit any U.S. state, top officials insist they will take action. Trump sounded the war drums early on because he was told this is a very live, if super dangerous and difficult, option. Officials have not laid out to us how this could unfold without putting millions of South Koreans and thousands of Americans at risk for deadly retribution. Note of caution: Trump hasn't yet concluded that he needs to take extreme measures against China. The national security team still believes there's room to bring more pressure to bear on North Korea and the clients supporting the state before launching a full-scale economic confrontation against China. Alaska's Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, whose state is likely within Kim Jong-un's missile range already, told me he believes Congress should invest more heavily in missile defense and work on legislation to approve ""a preventive ground war by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula."" ""The model there is either the first Gulf War or the Second Gulf War,"" Sullivan said in an interview Saturday. He said Trump would need this congressional authority — an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) — to abide by the Constitution but it also makes sense politically and diplomatically. Politically, because he believes the White House should want the American people to endorse, via their congressional representatives, such a momentous decision as a Second Korean War. An AUMF would also, Sullivan argues, ""provide the administration with additional leverage as they're trying to resolve this in a way without going to war."" Sullivan said he raised this issue with the administration but didn't want to get into details of the discussions. (An official I spoke to Sunday cautioned that such an AUMF is not on the administration's radar.) Sullivan said missile defense is the other crucial component of the North Korea policy, ""not just in the region but our own homeland."" He said the new National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) — the law specifying the Defense Department's policy priorities — that should pass either Monday or Tuesday, ""has real big plus-ups for missile defense for the homeland."" ""Alaska has the element of being on the front lines but also protecting the rest of the nation,"" due to its missile defense, Sullivan said. ""If [Kim Jong-un] knows there's no way he's going to get it through, even a madman won't do it.""",0.0
"Frontex Chief: 300,000 More Migrants Headed from Africa to Europe. The director of the agency for the control of the external borders of the European Union (EU) has predicted that as many as 300, 000 new migrants will be heading up from   Africa into Europe, most of whom will attempt to reach Italy as first port of call. [Fabrice Leggeri, the director of Frontex, said Tuesday that he based his estimates in part on recent surveys done in the Agadez region of  Niger, where   migration has reached 13 thousand persons per month.  “If migration flows from West Africa continue toward Libya, then we must expect some 300, 000 people fleeing this year from West Africa to the northern Maghreb, to then continue to travel to Europe,” he said in an interview with the German Funke media group. The director also expressed concern that an alternate route from Egypt has opened in the Mediterranean after the effective closing of the   Balkan route through Greece to Macedonia. With shifting migration patterns, 13 to 14 times more migrants are now traveling from Libya to Italy than from Turkey to Greece, he said. “The momentum is increasing. From April to May, the number of people fleeing to Italy doubled,” Leggeri noted, adding that the ethnic composition of the migrants has similarly shifted from the Middle East to Africa. “The majority of the asylum seekers are now coming from countries such as Eritrea in the Horn of Africa, where a brutal military regime is in power,” he said. “The numbers are increasing,” Leggeri said, noting that in just four days some 11, 000 migrants had been rescued in the Mediterranean, mostly in boats departing from Libya and heading to Italy. The Frontex chief also expressed his concern regarding the objective difficulty of the trip across the Strait of Sicily, the new preferred route for migrants trying to get to Europe. “It is a very dangerous crossing,” he said, “and it often takes more than ten days. There are few boats along this route available to assist migrants who are on sinking vessels. ” Last weekend, in fact, some 3, 000 migrants on board thirty different boats were rescued while attempting to make the crossing. “In all the time I spent in the central Mediterranean,” said one of the rescuers of Doctors Without Borders, “I’ve never seen anything like this, ever. ” The director of Frontex offered a grim overall evaluation of Europe’s migrant crisis, summing up EU immigration policy as a “failure. ” “The EU asylum policy has failed for a long time,” he said. “The EU countries are not even able to distribute the 160, 000 refugees proposed in 2015 by the Commission. ” “But the problem is: The migrants do not want to be distributed in EU countries. They have precise target countries such as Germany, where they want to go. This complicates a fair distribution of people in Europe,” he said. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @   <!

"KFC wins China payout over mutant chicken rumors. A Shanghai court has fined three local tech firms for helping spread rumors about Yum Brands' KFC fast food chain that included doctored photos of deformed chickens and allegations the birds had six wings and eight legs. In a statement on its official microblog, the Xuhui District People's Court said Yingchenanzhi Success and Culture Communication, Taiyuan Zero Point Technology and Shanxi Weilukuang Technology had ""damaged KFC's reputation"" and ""caused it economic losses"" by permitting the allegations to be posted on their social messaging accounts. The companies were ordered to make an official apology and fined a combined 600,000 yuan ($91,191), an amount that fell far short of the 1.5 million yuan ($227,977) Yum had asked each company to pay in damages. ""We brought suit against these individuals for making false statements about the quality of our food and we are pleased with the outcome,"" China-based Yum spokeswoman Cindy Wei said in emailed comments sent to Reuters. Reuters was unable to find contact numbers or websites for the three companies fined by the court. Yum is battling to turn around its fortunes in China, its largest market, where its sales have taken a serious hit after a series of food safety scares since the end of 2012. The firm is planning to spin off its China unit by the end of this year. KFC China brought the suit against the firms in June last year for using ten accounts on Tencent Holdings Ltd's popular messaging platform WeChat to spread the defamatory posts. Food safety is a major concern in China, with frequent scandals ranging from recycled ""gutter oil"" and years-old ""zombie meat"", to dairy laced with industrial chemicals. A food scandal in 2014 that dented Yum and rival McDonald's came to a close earlier this week when a Chinese court fined U.S. food supplier OSI Group and handed jail terms to ten of its executives over allegations it had reused returned food products to avoid losses.",0.0
"Rick Santorum Drops Out, Endorses Marco Rubio For President. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum ended his White House campaign on Wednesday and threw his support behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. ”We are suspending our campaign as of this moment,” Santorum said on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. Santorum said that after much prayer, he had decided that he was suspending his campaign. After talking to Rubio for more than an hour on Tuesday, Santorum said, he decided to back him, calling him the best person to continue the message of fighting ISIS and defending ”the central role of the family.” ”He is the new generation, and someone who can bring this country together, not just moderates and conservatives, but young and old,” Santorum said. In an email to his supporters, Santorum told them it was ”time to coalesce around the strongest candidate who will stand up for conservative values, be a statesman on the world stage, and has the ability to win a general election.” Four years ago, Santorum had an improbable rise after a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses, though he was not officially declared the winner until weeks later thanks to reporting glitches. Still, he became the choice for many conservative and evangelical voters against Mitt Romney and was the last remaining candidate in the race until he dropped out in April. But this year, the conservative former senator never caught fire amid a more crowded field filled with flashier, outsider candidates. Mired in the low single digits in polling, Santorum never made a main stage debate either, repeatedly relegated to the undercard.",-0.5

"Report: University of Pennsylvania Offers Puppies, Coloring Books to Students Distraught over Trump Win - Breitbart. Administrators at the University of Pennsylvania reportedly provided students upset over the results of Tuesday’s presidential election with emotional support puppies, coloring books, and chocolate. [The news was relayed by Penn student Daniel Tancredi, who told The College Fix that students at the Ivy League university were being coddled by administrators this week in response to Donald Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election.  “There were actual cats and a puppy there,” Tancredi told The College Fix. “There were sheets of paper available with black and white printed designs on them for students to color in. Essentially they looked like pages from a coloring book that were printed from a computer. They all had positive   messages on them. Students colored them in with colored pencils. ” As a result of being distraught, Tancredi claims that students avoided talking about the election, as many of them were too shaken by the outcome. “For the most part, students just hung out and ate snacks and made small talk,” Tancredi said. “Of course, that was in addition to coloring and playing with the animals. The election was mentioned a few times, though mostly in very timid and fearful tones. The event as a whole seemed to be an escape from the reality of the election results. ” Tancredi claims that many professors at the University of Pennsylvania turned Wednesday’s class sessions into “safe spaces,” where students were invited to express their concerns about America’s future. “Some professors turned Wednesday’s classes into ‘safe spaces’ in which students could freely express their concerns for their futures. On a campus that voted   in favor of Hillary Clinton, these open forums were naturally dominated by   voices. ” “Obviously the diversity at Penn is not diversity of opinion since the opinion of almost half the country is almost unaccounted for on campus,” Tancredi claimed. “I’m also worried for my fellow students.

"VC Venky Ganesan on interest rates, diamonds, and quietly imploding startups – TechCrunch. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers that she’s not ready to hold interest rates low for much longer, but she isn’t raising them right now.  Afterward, we talked about the news and what it might augur for startups with Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures, the early-stage firm that led Uber’s Series B round (among its many other investments). Part of that chat, edited for length, follows. TC: Are we wrong or does it sound from Yellen’s testimony like the money is going to keep rushing into Silicon Valley? VG:  Yes, though it’s not about when the Fed raises interest rates; it’s when [the Fed] tells the market they’re going to do it. There’s a sea of liquidity that gets pushed out when interest rates are low and gets pulled back fast when people think they’re going to rise. Remember, the slowdown in the market happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, when the Fed said it planned to raise interest rates in Q1. Then they backed down. Then they said the same in Q3 and they didn’t [raise rates]. TC: Is that good news or bad news for the startup ecosystem? VG: My sense is that you’re going to see an uptick in financings. The money is still flowing in. I don’t think it’s going to go back to where it was in early 2013, but you’re going to see some big financings get announced in Q4. TC: What are implications of that? Are there enough good companies to fund? VG: There’s enough big change in the word that people want to invest behind it. Are there enough good companies? No. But let’s say I told you there’s a treasure chest, and there are hundreds of balls in the chest and inside five of them, there’s a diamond ring worth a lot of money. The others are worth a dollar. You can either opt out of the game or you can try to buy all the balls, knowing you’re going to get a diamond. That’s [the mindset of investors]. They don’t know which companies will be the next Facebook or Uber, so they’re investing in everything. And you have to keep investing because what if the next one was Uber and you missed it? Basically, I think you’ll have this dynamic where the private markets will get back to valuing companies at a billion-plus dollars again but IPOs will be down rounds. TC: Menlo led Uber’s Series B round. Bill Gurley, whose firm, Benchmark, led its A round, suggested in a recent podcast that once Uber is public, it will have to be profitable and that meanwhile, still-private, deep-pocketed  competitors will likely try and undercut it on price and steal its market share. Uber is one of your diamond rings, so how big a concern is that for you? VG: Amazon isn’t profitable, and public market investors seem to understand and appreciate what Amazon is doing. I think some companies are given a pass. In general, my feeling is companies are staying public because they can raise the money privately and if you can do that – with less disclosures, fewer hassles, and not having to focus on stock price, which is a report card on your performance every day – why wouldn’t you? TC:  But they do have to exit at some point. And as you just said, a lot of these will be on the public markets, where their valuations take a hit. Isn’t someone getting hurt here? VG: I think the late-stage investors get hurt. And common shareholders get hurt, because you overcapitalize the company and when you do that, you take a good company that can have a good outcome and turn it into a good company with a bad outcome, including for employees. Like Good Technology — when it was sold to Blackberry, the common shareholders made nothing, and there were probably opportunities all along the way where they could have made some money. But [Good] wanted to go for the home run. And when you go for the home run, you also strike out a lot, and that’s a lot more painful for common shareholders and management teams. Not every company is going to be Uber. TC: This is so different than the last tech boom; it’s hard to imagine what happens next. VG: The last time [in 2000] all of this happened on the public market, so it was like you had a train wreck in slow motion on TV and all of us could watch it. Now, it might be a train wreck, but it’ll be private and no one can see it, which also means you aren’t going to feel it. Glam Media raised more than $200 million. It went away, but you didn’t see it. No one has a visceral reaction to that news.",0.0
"South Africa, a Nation With Sharp Inequality, Considers a Minimum Wage - The New York Times. KHAYELITSHA, South Africa  —   He works in AIDS prevention and his wife gets the occasional gig at a local supermarket. But neither job is regular enough for a “proper home,” Zwai Lugogo says, so his family lives in a shack here in Cape Town’s largest black township, making do with thin walls of painted metal. Many of his neighbors  —   housekeepers, factory workers, nurse’s aides  —   are in the same predicament, working hard at jobs available to black South Africans, but barely scraping by. “That money that we’re getting from work is just not enough to be able to take care of our families,” said Mr. Lugogo, 34, as neighborhood children, including his    son, ran around their narrow street recently. “We need an intervention. ” South Africa is now considering one. Faced with rising discontent over the economy among black voters, the government is weighing something more common in developed economies: a national minimum wage. Late last year, a government panel recommended about $260 a month, or about $1. 50 an hour  —   a small amount even in South Africa, but close to the median income in a country where the official unemployment rate is 27 percent and nearly half the population lives in poverty. Last week, the nation’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, endorsed the panel’s recommendation, vowing that the minimum wage would be in effect by May 2018. But in such a sluggish economy, opponents contend that the effort would destroy jobs, especially for the least skilled. Supporters counter that a minimum wage is the only way to reduce poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies, helping to dismantle an   system designed to provide cheap black labor for an economy dominated by the white minority. In few places do divisions run as deep as in South Africa. Wealthy communities with living standards equal to those in the West and inhabited disproportionately by whites rub shoulders uneasily with desperately poor townships. A government survey released in January found that black South Africans, who make up 80 percent of the population, earned only   of what whites did in 2015. Some smaller African economies, like those of Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, already have a national minimum wage. But only a small percentage of their workers are in the formal economy and therefore eligible for the minimum, experts say. And even for them, the rules tend not to be enforced. A national minimum wage would be more meaningful in a big economy like South Africa’s, experts say, because the formal work force is much larger, around 80 percent of all workers. Millions of people would be eligible. Still, South Africa,   Africa’s most advanced economy, is enduring the same forces as the rest of the continent. It is not growing fast enough to absorb its rapidly growing population, which is leaving rural areas to look for work in places like Khayelitsha, one of the country’s biggest townships with about 400, 000 people. There is added urgency for the government to act: The African National Congress, which helped liberate black South Africans from   rule and has governed the country since 1994, is still stinging from losing most of the nation’s biggest cities in elections last July. The party could once bank on loyal support from the nation’s black majority. But corruption and economic stagnation for millions of people have steadily eroded that support over the years, resulting in the party’s worst showing in elections since the end of apartheid in 1994. The frustrations are evident in Khayelitsha. It is roughly situated between two of South Africa’s richest areas: the city of Cape Town and the famed wine country of Stellenbosch. Established in 1983 by the apartheid government, Khayelitsha, which means new home in Xhosa, still provides many of the workers for both communities. On weekday mornings, soon after daybreak, the men and women of Khayelitsha leave their neighborhoods and walk to the nearest train or bus station. For many, the commute  —   a legacy of   urban planning to separate white and black areas  —   takes up to a couple of hours each way. Many on Mr. Lugogo’s street, known as Twecu Crescent, said their commute cost them a quarter or a third of their monthly wages. For black South Africans nationwide, the cost of taxis, buses and other passenger road transportation accounts for 5. 4 percent of their expenses, compared with 0. 2 percent for whites, who tend to own cars. A bus called the Golden Arrow stopped not far from Twecu Crescent with a few passengers already on board. It made several stops in Khayelitsha and, after passing a densely packed stretch of shanties, some precariously stacked two high, it pulled out of the township on its way toward Cape Town. Headed to residential areas, the bus transported mostly women who worked in malls or in homes as housekeepers. Along the way, in a scene repeated in many buses that morning, a woman, in this instance Julia Xakata, began preaching and leading the others in song. Some sang softly while checking their cellphones. Sitting near the front of the bus next to a window, Makatiso Sekhamane moved her lips while knitting a black cap. “I knit whenever I have some free time,” Ms. Sekhamane, 47, said, explaining that she usually completed a cap in two days and sold it for about $4. “It’s something. ” The caps supplemented the $400 a month she made working six days a week cleaning white people’s homes. Her husband earned maybe $150 repairing refrigerators. Their combined income supports five children and two grandchildren at home. Much of the discussion surrounding a national minimum wage  —   led by government, business, labor and academics  —   is expected to focus on the amount. According to the panel’s report, a monthly minimum wage of about $260 “would maximize benefits to the poor and minimize any possible” disincentives to work. The amount proposed by the panel is below the working poverty line of $325 a month, but because the median income of South African workers is only $280 a month, the minimum would help reduce inequality, the panel said. On Twecu Crescent, many of the employed already earn the proposed minimum, or more. But their wages are far below the salaries earned by the few residents in the nicest homes  —   $600 a month for a government worker, $900 a month for a young police officer. The proposed minimum “is not enough,” said Nombeko Mndangaso, who earns about $165 a month working five hours a day as a cleaner in a nursing home. “It won’t make a difference. ” With her husband, who makes $245 a month as a   security guard, they earn more than $400 a month. But with rent, transportation, electricity and two daughters, there is little left at the end of the month. A minimum wage of “at least” $340 a month per person, she said, would improve her family’s situation. Sparsely populated a generation ago, Twecu Crescent now has little or no space between homes. Many homeowners earn extra income by renting out shacks on their property to the endless stream of new arrivals to Khayelitsha. On Twecu Crescent, a short street divided into two blocks, the handful of sturdily built homes belonging to the upwardly mobile stand out. There is, in a   house, the woman who works at a bank down the street, the man employed by the government power utility and, on the corner, the police officer whose still unfinished house has a new red Peugeot in the driveway and a low wall with spikes to discourage people from sitting on it. The street is otherwise lined with more modest homes under corrugated roof sheets, inhabited by those making a third or half of what those in the nicer homes do, and shacks of varying quality occupied by those worse off. Discolored concrete blocks are neatly piled in many front yards, a sign of the slow and unsteady pace of progress for most on Twecu Crescent. Sinovuyo Gada’s family moved here in 1998. “There was no road here, just gravel,” she said. “There were no houses, just shacks. ” Her father, a welder, and her mother, who sells homemade food from a shack in their front yard, built the house in which she and her brother grew up. After finishing high school in 2012, she sent out her résumé to countless companies for three years before finally securing a   job through a friend. She now works four days a week at a supermarket at a mall in Cape Town, earning $60 a week. About 30 percent of that, or $18, goes to transportation. Ms. Gada, 22, is part of the “ ” generation of black South Africans who came of age after apartheid’s fall. But like many in her cohort, she was deeply dissatisfied with the pace of change in her family’s circumstances. “The apartheid, it’s still there,” she said. The wages she earned from the job that took so long in finding would do little to improve her situation, she said. She did not believe that a monthly minimum of $260 would help. Employers control the balance of power over people like her, she said. “They think sometimes we are desperate,” she said. “Yes, we are desperate, because we have families and children to take care of. ” It was early evening, and, all over Khayelitsha, men and women started coming home, most of them walking from bus stops to their streets, their gait slower than in the morning. On Twecu Crescent, girls sat on a corner playing a game of rocks. A boy pushing an old tire with a stick cast a long shadow up the street. The woman who was knitting on the bus, Ms. Sekhamane  —   better known on Twecu Crescent as Mama Kakiso, or the mother of Kakiso, her son  —   arrived home. She had had a busy day and, arriving late at the bus stop, had found no available seats on the Golden Arrow. She took a taxi instead, paying an amount equivalent to half the price of one of her black caps. “I’m going to wash my body and sleep now,” Mama Kakiso said as she slipped into her home. “I can’t do anything. ”",-1.0
"America risks one-party rule if gerrymandering isn’t stopped. As we are all experiencing, every day there’s some new shock from the   administration. Much of it is disgraceful. Yet we cannot let the tragedy of Donald Trump’s presidency distract us from the broader fight to restore and protect the legitimacy of our democracy. That legitimacy comes from the voters, and their influence is being systematically devalued by gerrymandering. A bedrock of our democratic legitimacy could rise or fall with the US supreme court’s decision as to whether to hear a case and finally rule on the constitutionality of   gerrymandering.  The court recently reaffirmed the illegality of racial gerrymandering in the case of North Carolina. But to protect fully our democratic legitimacy, the court must go further and prohibit gerrymandering done to cement   rule.  Over the past several years, a ground war has been conducted against our democratic legitimacy at the state level by state political parties intent on minimizing the power of certain voters. Their goal: near permanent   rule. This practice of   gerrymandering is destroying our democracy by   the election process. Rather than voters choosing their representatives, representatives choose their voters. I have reluctantly come to the view that the   solution is to take redistricting decisions away from elected officials, either by requiring that maps be drawn using   independent analysis, or putting redistricting entirely in the hands of independent commissions. I have previously supported legislative redistricting before these brutal tactics were employed. A   solution, however, lies with the US supreme court, which has an opportunity to ban this illegitimate political ploy by agreeing to hear Gill v Whitford, and ruling that Wisconsin’s   map is unconstitutional. The court could almost   reinstate the influence of voters by doing this.  In Gill v Whitford, Wisconsin voters are arguing that the state’s redistricting map violates their first amendment rights and the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. Using census data from 2010, the Wisconsin Republican party redrew the state district map so as to essentially guarantee that it wins a majority of seats in the state legislature. The district lines make no sense other than diluting the influence of Democratic voters and inflating the value of Republican voters.  Locking in a Republican majority in Wisconsin took some real creativity, and utter disregard for what makes our democracy legitimate. Democratic and Republican voters are not generally clustered into partisan areas of Wisconsin, but more spread out across the state.  And yet, with roughly 50% of the statewide vote in 2012 and 2014, the Republican party was able to lock in a solid majority in the state assembly, with 60 out of 99 seats in 2012, and 63 out of 99 seats in 2014. These outcomes are only possible with a district map that silences certain voters and gives a megaphone to others. This delegitimization also affects the resulting loyalties of the elected officials. In partisan gerrymandered districts, an elected official knows that the greatest threat to   is a primary challenger, which leads to   to the party bosses or their financial backers, regardless of their constituency or personal convictions.  Representatives do not need to answer to constituents, hold town halls, or even campaign very hard, so long as they stay in the good graces of the state party and in particular their   United big money backers. The supreme court has never before ruled a state’s redistricting plan unconstitutional because of partisan gerrymandering. While the court is often loathe to overturn its own precedent, it has done so in the past when our country has learned hard lessons from its own history. “Separate but equal” is a prime example. This may seem like a hyperbolic comparison, but it is less so when you consider the motives behind and impact of gerrymandering.  In these sorts of “party politics” cases, the court often defers to the political process, and in theory to the voters who have the power to change something if they oppose it. Solving the problem of gerrymandering, however, is extremely difficult for the voters.  In order for voters to make a statement about gerrymandering, they would have to elect new representatives, most likely from the opposite party. This is the very scenario that gerrymandering is designed to prevent. The Court should assert itself and be a check on    legislative bodies.  Our democracy’s legitimacy once again hangs in the balance when the Supreme Court considers whether to take this case. The Court cannot shirk this and demur to politicians. Our democratic system is being sorely tested.  Wisconsin Republicans argue that if their map is unconstitutional, so are many other states’ maps. They may be right, but that is no reason to avoid this case. It is actually all the more reason to take it. We need a new precedent, and our democratic legitimacy requires it.",-0.5
"Italy avalanche rescuers: we’ve called out but heard no replies, no voices. Barely 24 hours earlier, the management of the hotel in the picturesque Italian ski resort of Farindola, three hours east of Rome, had tweeted: “A dream Tuesday . .. The snow is giving us spectacular scenery!” But by Thursday afternoon authorities held out little hope of finding anyone left alive after an avalanche buried the   building with its eight staff and 20 guests, including several children, inside. They were reported to have assembled on the ground floor on Wednesday awaiting an evacuation after a series of earthquakes had rocked the area during the day, but it was delayed because of the bad weather. Then the avalanche hit.  Amid treacherous weather conditions, rescue workers and sniffer dogs continued their search on Thursday at the   Rigopiano hotel in the lower Gran Sasso mountain range of the central Abruzzo region. Titti Postiglione, head of the department’s emergency office, said more avalanches were possible because the temperature was rising, while further quakes were also possible. “This is an enormously complex rescue operation,” she said. Firefighters at the scene said the hotel, which stood about 1, 200 metres above sea level, had been swept away and “only a little piece” remained upright.  Luca Cari, a fire service spokesman, said: “The building was basically run over by the avalanche, leaving it buried. I saw mattresses that had been dragged for hundreds of metres, which shows how big the search area is. There are tonnes of snow, tree trunks and all kinds of detritus. ” The bodies of three victims had been removed from the hotel, authorities said. Two people, both with hypothermia, survived because they were outside the building when the avalanche hit. One was Giampaolo Parete, 38, who told doctors he had gone to collect something from the family car, leaving his wife and children, aged six and eight, inside. “I am alive because I went to get something from my car,” Parete told medical staff.  “This is a tragedy of enormous proportions,” said the Italian health minister, Beatrice Lorenzin. Antonio Crocetta, a member of the Alpine rescue squad who was on the scene, told Reuters: “The hotel is almost completely destroyed. We’ve called out but we’ve heard no replies, no voices. We’re digging and looking for people. ” The first rescue workers reached the area by helicopter and ski in the early hours of Thursday, but it was midday before a snow plough and excavation equipment managed to pass the   roads leading to the hotel. Italian TV images showed piles of snow and rubble in the hotel’s foyer, while rescuers were filmed digging through a wall of snow. A base camp for rescue workers was set up in the town of Penne, about six miles (10km) away, where ambulances waited for the road to be cleared. Avalanche warnings were issued across the region, dominated by Gran Sasso, a majestic   (9, 554ft) peak. The area is home to numerous small ski resorts that are popular with   from Rome and urban centres on Italy’s east coast. Experts say the avalanche may have been triggered by the earthquakes that struck the central Italian region on Wednesday, measuring between 5. 1 and 5. 7 magnitude.  An    man died after the roof of a farm building in Castel Castagna, a town in the Abruzzo province of Teramo, collapsed on him.  A mother and her child were pulled from rubble in the same area, while the search for a    man, buried under snow in nearby Campotosto, was called off on Wednesday night. Three farmers were reported missing.  “In general, avalanches can be caused by earthquakes,” said Paolo Bazzurro, a professor of hazard and risk assessment at the University Institute for Superior Studies in Pavia, “but there is no certainty yet that this is the case”. The civil protection agency has warned of further avalanches, with its chief saying the situation remained critical. The Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said Italy was caught in an “unprecedented vice” of simultaneous earthquakes and heavy snows. “Bad weather and earthquakes in the same area have made it a complicated situation,” Fabrizio Curcio said, adding that authorities were confronting “two exceptional events that already alone would have created great difficulty in the response”.  He said that when heavy snowfall was expected “we try to tell people to stay in their own homes, if they are secure, obviously. And in the areas of quakes, people should leave their homes. Putting together these two elements is extremely complicated”. The quakes struck near Amatrice, one of the towns destroyed by an earthquake in August that left almost 300 people dead and thousands homeless. Two powerful tremors struck the area in late October, but nobody died because the inhabited areas affected had already been evacuated.  Bazzurro said there was a significant probability that the highly seismic area would be hit by more tremors. The bell tower of the Sant’Agostino church in Amatrice, the last monument to survive last summer’s quake, collapsed after the first quake on Wednesday morning, according to local news reports. Since the Amatrice disaster in August, there have been nine shocks measuring more than a five magnitude and a total of 47, 000 registered aftershocks. Italy straddles the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, making it vulnerable to seismic activity when they move. Reuters and Agence   contributed to this report",-0.5
"Why the Maker Movement Matters: Part 1, the Tools Revolution. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In the years when I was visiting and learning about factories in China, my dominant emotion was, I can’t wait to tell people about this! Of course everyone “knew,” in general terms, about the rise of Chinese manufacturing and the country’s role as    . But the experience of seeing the factories that turned out computers and smart phones and everything else was so different from hearing about “  Chinese sweatshops” that I thought, people really have no idea. Sure, low wages and    regulatory and environmental standards were big advantages. But it was mainly the speed of the industrial ecosystem in places like Shenzhen that was so amazing. And the density of all elements of the supply chain  —   if you needed a certain kind of keyboard or connector, there were five suppliers to choose from within an hour’s drive. And one more underappreciated element was essential: the new tools of connectivity and logistics that allowed a customer in Chicago to shop online for a smartphone, and have the customized specs conveyed instantly to a production line in China, where the order would be put together and then taken to the airport in Hong Kong for airfreight back to the U. S. These new tools really mattered: China had had low wages for a very long time (and they were beginning to rise fast in these factory zones) it had abused the environment for years (and was trying to clean up). But it was only the   of information and logistics that allowed Chinese factories to be so directly incorporated into the world    system. That’s the story I told nine years ago in “China Makes, The World Takes,” centered on a company that had pioneered this kind of connection. I have had a similar feeling in recent years as I’ve seen outposts of the “Maker Movement” across the United States: This matters! People should pay attention! In this and the next few dispatches I’ll explain why I think so, and give illustrations from Kentucky, Oregon, South Carolina, California, and elsewhere. I imagine that many readers might have heard of this movement or seen one of its Maker Faires. But my guess is that most people who aren’t directly involved think of it as fringe and      and hip rather than a serious economic, technological, and   force. I’ve come to disagree, and let me lay out some of the reasons why. First, the lay of the landscape: You can see information about the national Maker Faire cycle here, for information about shows and displays. The next big event on the calendar is the National Maker Faire, in DC two weeks from now. You can read here about MakerCon, which I’ve been to and enjoyed, and go here for Make: magazine, to which I subscribe. In two weeks the White House will have events for the National Week of Making, with more information here. Make: had a story on the Maker City Initiative here Peter Hirschberg has a speech explaining the concept here and the Institute for the Future had an early report here. Now, what this movement is and why it matters. Everyone who has heard a recent political speech, listened to a talk show, or looked at the “Made in China” labels in retail stores is familiar with the idea that “America doesn’t make things any more. ” There are obvious reasons, and some less obvious ones, why people feel this way. A certain kind of   production certainly has shifted from the rest of the world to China (and elsewhere) in the past generation. As economies get richer, the relative share of manufacturing in their output and their workforce inevitably goes down (as it does for farming —  even as absolute output in both categories keeps going up) because service sectors are growing faster. This is true even of economies which much more aggressive   industrial government policies and corporate practices, like Germany and Japan: And as manufacturing efficiency grows up, the share of manufacturing jobs goes down even faster than the output share. Everyone’s grandfather worked in a factory each generation, fewer do. So there is a real change —  fewer Americans have jobs in manufacturing —  that seems even larger than it is, because of the kinds of things America still makes. Consumers naturally mainly see consumer goods: TVs, electronics, gadgets, clothes. Those are the fields in which production has disproportionately shifted overseas. Walk into a WalMart or Costco, and just about everything seems to come from China. The   capital goods or scientific equipment from U. S. manufacturers rarely comes before our eyes. (The main exception is Boeing airplanes, with GE or Pratt  Whitney engines.) We see the “assembled in China” labels on Apple computers and phones and   what that means. The labels conceal the reality that the most valuable parts of a Mac or iPhone come not from China but from richer countries like Japan, Germany, South Korea, and very significantly from the United States. To wrap this up for now: yes, manufacturing is in relative decline across the developed world, although most Americans think the situation is worse than it really is. And yes, the decline of     manufacturing is part of the worsening pressure on   earners, also around the world. So anything that can spur new manufacturing is a plus —  with an emphasis on the new, given the repeated findings by the Kauffman Foundation that essentially all net job creation in the United States is from companies in their first few years of existence. (Explanation here. Short version: Older companies, in aggregate, gradually reduce their total workforce over time, as some go out of business and some get streamlined. Thus, the net job growth is from   companies.)   What might the maker movement have to do with that? It has made it surprisingly easier for new companies, in manufacturing, to start. Why? It has to do with tools. Here’s how I finally understood the difference that a new generation of production tools has made: by comparing it to my own business, writing and publishing. Everyone in journalism knows the line attributed to A. J. Liebling, in The New Yorker: “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one. ” Liebling wrote that in 1960. As    recently as that in historical terms, if you wanted to disseminate your thoughts to people outside your household, you simply could not do it yourself. You had no option but to work through a limited number of powerful,   enterprises. You had to convince a newspaper or magazine to publish your writings —  because only they controlled the printing presses, delivery networks, and newsstands. (I remember the olden days of wanting to react to something in the news, and then making phone calls or sending letters —  ! !! yes, real letters in the mail on paper ! !! —  to the handful of gatekeepers who ran   pages, hoping you could get their interest.) You had to attract the attention of TV or radio reporters, since only they could get you on the air. If you had a longer story to tell, you had to convince a publishing house to put out your book. Short of going    with flyers, there was no way to avoid the middleman in this industry. And the people who served as middlemen —  the publishers, the broadcasters —  were buttressed by the very expensive printing and transmitting equipment they controlled. Wave after wave of disruption in publishing have been bad for everyone who used to hold that middleman role. (The Atlantic is doing very well right now —  so thanks for reading and subscribing!) But the new tools fostered an unprecedented outpouring of expression. Blogs, Tweets, YouTube videos, Instagrammed photos, podcasts, Reddit and Facebook communities, billions upon billions of daily texts messages   …     One by one many of these might be trivial and some of them destructive. But taken together they produced a totally different form of communication and knowledge, and countless millions of new business operations, all because an advance in production tools. There’s a similar   change whose effects are so profound that we never even think about them any more. In the early days of computer use and   if you wanted to write something electronically, you had to wrestle with a lot of the details of electronic life. The first computer I ever used, in the late 1970s, was one I bought from a   warehouse in Ohio I had to reprogram it to be able to use a writing program called The Electric Pencil. Now people may grumble about Word, Pages, and other programs, but using them requires about as much forethought as picking up a real pencil. In the early days of web design, to put anything online you had to know a lot about layout code. Including pictures, charts, videos, or sounds was so hard you generally didn’t bother. Now you copy an embed code, you click Share or Send or Upload, and the job is done. Tools that were unknown a generation ago are now ubiquitous and have changed everything about communication and expression. Something similar is fostering the maker movement. Since the dawn of the capitalist   era, to succeed in manufacturing you needed capital. You needed money for giant production equipment. Blast furnaces if you were making steel, assembly lines if you were making cars, machine tools if you were making engines, coordinated supply chains if you were assembling complex devices. Then you needed distribution arrangements with stores, and lots of inventory for them to keep in the warehouse, and other impediments that collectively made it hard, expensive,   and   for newcomers to enter a business. This is the equation that the tools revolution of the past few years is also changing for manufacturing. A combination of 3D printing (which allows people to make and revise prototypes onsite, and produce certain     items themselves, rather than going to a factory) much less expensive laser cutters, milling machines, and other sophisticated machine tools the evolution of Arduino controls, which allow designers to add sophisticated electronic functions without doing all the coding themselves. You could think of this last function as being similar to simple Embed functions for images or videos online. In parallel with these technological advances have been organizational changes. For instance, the rise of   and   site where people can use advanced machinery for free or at very low cost and the rise of collaborations among universities, community colleges, established companies, and local financiers in fostering hardware entrepreneurs. One of the most ambitions of those collaborative spaces is “Highway 1” in San Francisco. I wrote about its origins in the magazine back in 2012 you can read a report about its latest “Demo Day,” at which maker groups show off their products, in a TechCrunch story here and see a video here. This video from Highway 1 is obviously promotional, but it demonstrates the changes I am talking about and rings true to what I have seen and heard from entrepreneurs there (I have met and interviewed some of the people you see here). *** “This would not have been possible ten years ago,” Venkat Venkatakrishnan, the CEO of a unique and famous maker space called FirstBuild, told me in Louisville earlier this year. FirstBuild is unique because it was created by GE, as a subsidiary of its appliance division and as a deliberate effort to bring the nimble maker spirit to its design process. “What has changed is that the maker movement has figured out a group of technologies and tools which enable us to manufacture in low volume,” Venkat (as he is known) said. Big manufacturers like GE built their business on     very   production, where each new product means a bet of tens of millions of dollars. FirstBuild is mean to explore smaller, faster, more customizable options. “Now you can get a circuit board mill for $8, 000. If you are looking for a circuit board for an appliance, earlier the only chance of getting it was from China. Today I can make boards here and ship them out quickly. Similarly with laser cutters —  not big ones but small ones, where I can cut metal right here. It’s a huge advantage, and these things did not exist ten years from now. In those days you couldn’t hack the kind of creative solutions we are seeing now. ” Tomorrow FirstBuild and its parent GE Appliances division are expected to complete a   deal that will transfer ownership to the giant Chinese appliance maker Haier. (GE had previously planned to sell to the Swedish firm Electrolux, which has a much bigger presence in the U. S. market than Haier does, but it called off the deal last year after resistance from U. S.   regulators.) Both GE and Haier have said that that all factories and facilities will stay where they are (Electrolux had planned a move to its existing sites in North Carolina) that the GE Appliance and FirstBuild management will be unchanged and that the FirstBuild   mission will continue too. That’s the   corporate news. In the next installment, more details on exactly what FirstBuild has underway, how that parallels efforts in other parts of the country, and what this Maker energy might mean for the country’s ability to foster new companies and create better jobs.",-0.5
"Joe Biden’s Turkey visit: Exiled cleric will be ’top of agenda’.  (CNN) When US Vice President Joe Biden visits Turkey on August 24, he’ll no doubt have plenty to discuss with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the top items on the agenda will likely be Fethullah Gulen, the   cleric Erdogan accuses of planning an attempted military coup in July. Erdogan has demanded that the United States immediately extradite the    imam from his home in Pennsylvania to Turkey. Gulen has denied the allegations. Read more: Who is Fethullah Gulen, the man blamed for coup attempt in Turkey? At a news conference in Istanbul Saturday, the Turkish President said that the group Gulen leads    which the Turkish government says is a terror group    will be ”the number one item on the agenda” during Biden’s visit.   A delegation of officials from the State Department and Justice Department also will travel to Turkey to consult with government officials there about Turkey’s investigation into Gulen, a State Department spokesperson said Saturday. Erdogan added that relations between Turkey and the US were ” ” following the attempted coup in which almost 300 people were killed and over 35, 00 people were arrested, remanded, or detained.

But Erdogan and other Turkish officials have claimed the US and other Western countries haven’t been forceful enough in their denunciations of the attempt to remove Erdogan from power. Amid these tensions, the US must also rely on Turkey as a partner in NATO and for its agreement to allow the US military to use a base in Turkey to stage its air missions to fight ISIS in Syria.  Gulen’s extradition  Senior White House officials told CNN they were working in ” ” with counterparts in Turkey to ensure all evidence is received in the Gulen case. However, they added, Gulen’s extradition case will be determined in court    not by the US President or vice president. ”What I said to President Erdogan is the same thing I would say to you and anybody else who asks, which is that we have a process here in the United States for dealing with extradition requests made by foreign governments, and it’s governed by treaties and by laws, and it’s not a decision that I make,” US President Barack Obama has previously said. NATO, During his visit to Turkey, Vice President Biden will also emphasize the widespread support for upholding NATO, amid international concerns about what a Trump presidency could mean for the organization, a senior White House official told CNN. In a New York Times interview, Trump outlined a sharp break in US foreign policy tradition, suggesting the US wouldn’t defend NATO allies like the Baltic states against Russian aggression if they haven’t ”fulfilled their obligation to us.” The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly made the case that most of NATO’s   countries are not making the requisite financial contributions for their common defense, and he’s said in the past that ”the US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.” Opinion: The danger of Trump’s comments  Erdogan and Putin meeting, Following the recent    meeting between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, senior White House officials told CNN they were ”encouraged” that the two countries are ”mending fences” after November’s fly over incident.

The Turkish leader made a point of saying that the visit was his first foreign trip since he saw off July’s uprising    perhaps an indication of his dismay at the perceived lack of support from his NATO partners.",-1.0
"What Democrats can learn from Hannibal | TheHill. One of my favorite military leaders in history was Hannibal of Carthage. His use of the double envelopment tactic at the Battle of Cannae contributed to our operational envelopment maneuver employed in Operation Desert Storm. And Hannibal’s use of elephants as part of his operations was revolutionary and innovative. However, there comes a time when your tactics must adapt—even change—and so it was with Hannibal. At the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal defeated, and killed, Roman Consul General Scipio the older, but his son survived. It was Scipio the younger who learned, adapted, and defeated Hannibal later in North Africa at the Battle of Zama.   The battlefield innovator Hannibal, who was the first commander of a multinational, multifaceted military force did not change his tactics. He still employed elephants in the same manner, and was defeated. What is the relevance for today? The progressive left has taken over the Democratic Party—President John F. Kennedy would not be welcomed. The left’s playbook, tactics, are based upon Saul Alinksy’s book “Rules for Radicals.” These tactics were very integral in the rise of Barack ObamaBarack Hussein Obama3 real problems Republicans need to address to win in 2020 Obama's high school basketball jersey sells for 0,000 at auction  Dirty little wars and the law: Did Osama bin Laden win? MORE, but they did not translate to success for Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE. So, in post November 2016 election, will a doubling down on these tactics yield success, or further defeat for the Democrat party? It is said in the south, “if you go to the same well too often, eventually there may be no water.” Normally that applies well with SEC football when you tend to run the same play too often, the defense adjusts and stops you. This is where Democrats run the risk of irrelevance. These constant protests, to include a series of planned identity politics strikes, may feel like a winning tactic. But to whom? When Democrats decry others as “fascists” while progressives violently protest and shut down free speech of others, the left's position becomes irrelevant. When New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, for example, compared an election to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, progressives are losing the messaging battle. It may sound great in the echo chamber of like-minded folks isolated to the coasts, college campuses, and entertainment elitist circles, but not to the greater American people. A loyal political opposition party is something admired in America, but the opposition need be based upon sound policy. Progressive Democrats must begin to realize that their playbook is outdated. They have to comprehend that their tactics are no longer effective. No one complained about the last minute change of the Obama administration of the Cuban immigration policy that sentenced freedom loving people to a brutal communist regime. There was hardly a sound made when President Barack Obama was awarded the Politifact “Lie of the Year” in 2013 for his “If you like your health care plan...” line. When healthcare insurance premiums rose astronomically, Americans were simply disregarded, and we remember the words of one Jonathan Gruber who implied that most Americans were too dumb to understand. Yet, we have a new administration that has not even been in office one month, and political figures such as Rep. Maxine Waters are talking about impeachment. If Democrats read about Hannibal of Carthage, they might learn that regardless of how brilliant you may have been, if you do not adjust your tactics, you will eventually be defeated.

"Ted Strickland: Tim Kaine ’Ready to Become President’ If Necessary - Breitbart. While introducing Democratic   nominee Tim Kaine at a high school in Dayton on Monday, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland raised eyebrows by stressing that Kaine is “ready to become the president,” if Hillary Clinton proves unable to serve. [The New York Times has Strickland praising Kaine as “a wonderful and prepared person to be the president” in Clinton’s place.  The Times said this sounded “a little awkward,” since Clinton is ostensibly recovering from pneumonia after collapsing on Sunday. However, the paper assured readers that Strickland “wasn’t specifically referring to Clinton’s current state of health. ” Strickland did specifically address Clinton’s health with reporters during his visit to Stivers High School, according to the Columbus Dispatch: “Secretary Clinton by all reports is a healthy person. A lot of people get pneumonia. That’s not something to be terribly concerned about,” Strickland told reporters. “There have been efforts for a long time to imply that she is not healthy. I think that is part of her political enemies’ attempt to conjure up a rumor that could hurt her politically. I don’t think there’s any evidence she has any serious chronic health conditions that could make it difficult for her to serve as president. ” When asked whether Clinton needs to get back out on the trail in a close race, Strickland replied, “I think the most critical thing for her to do is to be fully recovered of this pneumonia. I would hope that she would take whatever time is needed to fully recover.   …     It’s tough when you get little sleep and you’re making speech and you’re giving interviews. It can wear on you. ” The Toledo Blade reports Kaine also talked about Clinton’s condition: “I reached out to her,” he said. “She reached right back to me. She said, ‘I’m going to be fine,’ and she started to make fun of me because I was sitting reading endless debate memos  …    She was immediately responding back and joking around. She has been on the campaign trail 18 months. Her energy staggers me. We know she’ll be a fantastic president. ” The Blade states that Kaine has canceled another campaign event that was scheduled for northeastern Ohio on Tuesday, without specifying the reason. Clinton canceled a fundraising trip to California on Monday.",1.0
"Donald Trump: Concealed Carry Could Have Saved Lives in Orlando. During a June 15 speech in Atlanta presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump explained that concealed carry could have stopped or at least lessened the number of dead in the Pulse Orlando attack. [He explained that the Orlando nightclub was a   zone, saying it “was full of innocent people and you had no guns on the other side. ”  Trump said, “By the way, I’m going to save your Second Amendment. ” And once the applause subsided he added: If some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle —  and if bullets were going in the other direction, aimed at that guy [for whom this was just] target practice —  you would have had a situation which would have [been] horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we as a people suffered this weekend. Trump continued by pointing to France and talking about how the   concert venue ended with 130 persons shot dead on November 13, 2015.  Eight days after that attack Trump told George Stephanopoulos that an armed citizenry could have prevented the “horror show” in Paris.

"Brooklyn Federal Court Sides with Apple, Emboldening Tech Giant in San Bernardino Case. In a ruling that could have ramifications for Apple’s battle with the FBI over the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, a federal   in Brooklyn yesterday denied the government’s request in a similar case to compel Apple to assist the government in searching the iPhone of a suspected narcotics trafficker. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein rejected the Justice Department’s claim that the All Writs Act authorizes the court to coerce Apple’s cooperation. An unsettling aspect of the cases on both coasts is the Justice Department’s urging of the All Writs Act on the courts as a capacious source of power to coerce assistance from third parties. Interestingly, while Apple has vigorously contested the AWA order in California, the tech giant itself suggested that the Justice Department seek one in Brooklyn. Apple was willing to help in the Brooklyn case (as it has done in approximately 70 other cases) but only if there was an order, which the company even helped the Justice Department draft. It was Magistrate Judge Orenstein who was troubled about whether he had the authority to issue the order. Only when the court hesitated and asked for more briefing on the AWA did Apple do an   and oppose the issuance. RELATED: However Clumsily, Apple is Confirming a Constitutional Principle, The dispute between the government and Apple involves an attempt to force the company, by judicial order, to assist the FBI (which, in Brooklyn, is assisting the DEA) in circumventing the personal identification numbers (PINs) of iPhones that have been lawfully seized in criminal investigations. The FBI does not have this technological capability and is thus unable to execute warrants to search the contents of these phones. veered off the rails when, in 1977, the Supreme Court saw fit to commandeer the New York Telephone Company into the FBI’s wiretapping operations. The decision rested on the dubious theory that, as a highly regulated, monopolistic public utility, the phone company was a virtual arm of the government. In fact, the Court stressed that New York Tel had “a duty to serve the public” that it had a “substantial interest” in helping the FBI, since the government’s objectives were not “offensive” to the company’s and that the assistance it was being forced to provide was “meager” and not “in any way burdensome. ” The Court purported to find this authority to compel such assistance from third parties in the AWA. It was, to say the least, a stretch  —   one that needs even more stretching to be applied to Apple. As I argued in the column: “The company is not a public utility, it does not have a duty to serve the public, its interests in enhancing privacy do not align with government interests in enabling intrusion, and the demands the government is making would be burdensome. ” Yet, in jurisprudence as in legislation, the   ratchet inevitably expands the scope of the state’s power to coerce private actors. Consequently, the AWA precedents that have piled up since 1977 seem to stack the deck against Apple. RELATED: Phone Fight with the Government Shows How Apple Misled the Public, Not, however, according to Magistrate Judge Orenstein. He concluded that the Justice Department’s construction of AWA power was too broad. Significantly, he added that Congress had considered legislation to give courts the authority to issue orders of the type the government is seeking but had not enacted such legislation  —   meaning, in Orenstein’s view, that issuing such an order would be a judicial usurpation of Congress’s power. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Finally, the magistrate judge reasoned that, even if the AWA theoretically vests courts with the power to issue such orders, it would be inappropriate to compel Apple, for three reasons: The company has nothing to do with the criminal conduct alleged the requested order would be burdensome and the government failed to prove that Apple’s assistance is necessary, since   agents represented, in yet another Brooklyn case, that they have the technology needed to override PINs. (The Justice Department now claims this technology is “finicky,” which did not impress Orenstein.) RELATED: Unlock the Terrorist’s Phone, It is noteworthy that the Brooklyn narcotics case involves an iPhone 5 that uses Apple’s operating system iOS7  —   the same as the phone in the San Bernardino terrorism case. This is clearly a complex area of law that cries out for legislative guidance. The interwoven issues of privacy, trade secrets, national security, counterterrorism, criminal investigations, and   technology are delicate and intricate. The task of balancing them should not be delegated to the courts there should be a legislative solution, with lawmakers weighing the competing interests of the many relevant actors removed from the peculiar exigencies of individual criminal cases. RELATED: Hooray for Tim Cook, The government’s effort to exploit the All Writs Act, while there is undeniably precedent for it, bypasses this vital process. It discourages   cooperation with Congress: Why would the Justice Department work with lawmakers  —   who will weigh the needs of all interests, including some important privacy interests that are in tension with the executive branch’s   and   missions  —   when judges may be more accommodating? The executive branch may calculate that fashioning new law in court on a    basis  —   with many interested parties not represented, as they would be in a legislative process  —   will produce a more favorable   outcome than would a statute. The ruling in Brooklyn upsets those calculations. Of course, Magistrate Judge Orenstein’s   decision could be reversed on appeal moreover, it is not binding on the federal court in California, though Apple will certainly use it like a club. The optimal result would be to stir Congress to action. The All Writs Act has its place  —   Apple’s claim that it is suspect just because it is old is specious. But it was not designed to broker the competing claims of privacy and security in an era of rapidly evolving technology in which security often depends on privacy.  —   . ",1.0

"Obama’s toxic mind game with police.     President Obama journeys to Dallas Tuesday in the wake of the slaughter of five police officers there by Micah Johnson, the sniper who methodically assassinated them specifically because they were officers of the law, and white. The president’s visit to Dallas is   because during his presidency he has sown the seeds of hatred for police officers. That began with his condemnation of Sgt. James Crowley in Cambridge, Mass. for simply doing his job. Crowley arrested Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. who appeared to be breaking into what turned out to be his own home. It continued when Obama sent   General Eric Holder to the funeral of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. after Brown tried to take a white police officer’s gun and was killed by the officer. The president arrives in Dallas having caused countless police officers severe psychological trauma. He has put officers in the paralyzing position of defending the whole of our citizenry after he has methodically cleaved that citizenry into pieces, with some like shards of glass ready to cut officers down.  And it hasn’t stopped. Even the president’s recent statement that those who attack white police officers are doing “disservice to the cause” implies, psychologically, that protesters have every reason to be enraged, organized and on the march, but that they should try to show restraint. The president arrives in Dallas having caused countless police officers severe psychological trauma. He has put officers in the paralyzing position of defending the whole of our citizenry after he has methodically cleaved that citizenry into pieces, with some like shards of glass ready to cut officers down. He has implicitly suggested that officers ask themselves if their impulses to protect and to serve are a thin veil for opposite impulses to harm citizens  —   even to kill them. Journeying to Dallas in “support” of police officers is another toxic mind game by the president. It apparently wasn’t enough for him to pit whole populations against the police. It apparently wasn’t enough for him to make police question their own motivations and decency. Now he has to deny that he was the instigator of these seditious forces by praising officers and saying he mourns those who were assassinated. This will deprive some officers of their own proper rage at having been wrongly vilified by the president.  And denying one’s proper rage is the growing place for depression. The tug of war inside America, as regards those charged with protecting and serving us, at risk of their own lives, is the product of the Obama administration. The tug of war inside police officers who must protect and serve us while wondering if large numbers of us hate them is the product of the Obama administration. I believe the president knows very well that dividing is the way to conquer the spirit of our nation and the spirit of those fundamentally decent men and women who protect our laws with their lives.

"Google’s self-driving car in broadside collision after other car jumps red light. One of Google’s   cars was involved in one of the worst autonomous vehicle accident yet, when a driver ran a red light and collided with the passenger side door of the modified Lexus SUV. The driver of the vehicle passed through a red light as one of Google’s fleet of autonomous Lexus SUVs passed through a green light on Friday afternoon. The collision, which occurred at the intersection between El Camino Rea and Phyllis Ave in Mountain View, California, caused the Google car’s airbags to be deployed, and caved in its front and rear   doors. Mountain View police said that no injuries were reported, but the Google car had to be towed away on a flatbed truck. Google’s autonomous vehicles are no stranger to accidents, suffering multiple impacts with various vehicles. Mostly they’ve been   when either driving slowly or stationary at a junction, suffering minor damage. The side impact in this most recent accident is one of only a few that have caused major damage to the expensive test vehicles. Google said that the car was in   mode with a person sitting at the steering wheel. The Google car hit the brakes automatically on seeing the other car crossing the red light, followed by the human behind the wheel doing the same, but it wasn’t enough to prevent the collision. James Allen, who happened upon the crash, told KBCW: “I’ve never seen one in an accident and I see at least 30 to 40 a day. They’re very good cars, that’s why I was so shocked. ” A Google spokesperson told 9to5Google: “Our light was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection. Thousands of crashes happen everyday on US roads, and   running is the leading cause of urban crashes in the US. Human error plays a role in 94% of these crashes, which is why we’re developing fully   technology to make our roads safer. ” Google’s fleet of autonomous cars have covered over 2m miles and has been involved in around two dozen accidents, with only one  —   a collision with a bus  —   being the fault of the   car.",-0.5
"UKIP’s Peter Whittle: The British People Will Kick The Establishment On Thursday - Breitbart. The British people have lost trust in the establishment and no matter what the outcome of Thursday’s referendum, they will never trust their rulers again, UKIP Assembly Member Peter Whittle has said. [Speaking on Breitbart News Daily this morning, the London Assembly Member said that many people in Britain have stopped believing what they hear in the mainstream media, particularly the BBC, regarding immigration and on Thursday may vote to give the Establishment a bloody nose.  “The majority of people in the country have realised that whilst we are in this thing called the EU we cannot control our borders,” Mr Whittle said. “So when the Prime Minister says thing such as ‘I’m going to get migration down to the tens of thousands’ people realise he can’t be telling the truth while we are in the EU. ” This distrust has spread not just to British politicians but foreign leaders as well. For example, when US President Barack Obama told Britons that they were better off within the EU, people “took a healthy lack of interest” to a foreign leader trying to “intervene and say what is good for us”. A lot of this has to do with the “groupthink” of the mainstream media, which mostly employs people who like the EU and cannot see any problem with mass immigration, Mr Whittle added. It also stems from the fact that after the Second World War, Europe’s elites stopped trusting the people and instead embarked on a utopian vision of a united Europe. If you look across to continental Europe, Mr Whittle said, “much of the   movement is actually amongst young people, particularly in places like Italy,” something he described as “very encouraging. ” Expressing his disappointment that many young people in Britain apparently do not feel the same way, he explained: “In this country we have generations who have grown up essentially thinking that this is the natural order of things, and so somehow or other they have to be particularly convinced that when it comes to our sovereignty, when it comes to our liberty, these are concepts which are far more important than the ability to have great telephone roaming charges across Europe. ” No matter what the result on Thursday, however, it is clear people no longer trust the elite. “Whatever happens on Thursday things cannot stay the same. “The British ruling class are very clever and they have always had the ability to somehow keep the appearance of things the same even when things have actually changed, but I think that the credibility of some of our most senior politicians is seriously damaged. ” “We have had this stasis now for way too long and I think that we need a great renewal after Thursday and I hope that’s what we’re going to get,” he said.

"Popularity of election forecasts aided Clinton’s loss, says strategist. Hillary Clinton’s chief campaign strategist said a national “obsession” with campaign forecasters like Nate Silver and New York Times’ Upshot blog had deeply worried the Democratic presidential campaign in the final weeks of the election, and could have hurt voter turnout. Speaking at a conference held at New York University’s Florence campus, La Pietra, Joel Benenson, a pollster and consultant who also worked on Barack Obama’s successful campaigns in 2008 and 2012, said a number of factors contributed to Clinton’s stunning defeat last week, including actions by FBI director James Comey. But he singled out the relatively new phenomenon of reporting on elections not just by examining national and state polls, but by forecasting probability of a candidate winning by looking at aggregates of polls and other factors.  Clinton’s odds of winning the election on the Upshot, the New York Times forecasting model, were 85% on election day and only began to plummet as results came in late in the night. “[There was] a lot of the coverage and obsession with Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight and the Upshot focusing on the probability of a win,” Benenson said.  “And I think when we have people talking about whether there is a 93% probability that Hillary is going to win [or not] as opposed to her being up 2% in the polls   …     it’s a real concern. Because you don’t want people to think an election is over. ” Benenson was one of several election officials and political pundits to speak on a panel about the US election results. “[Forecasting] is not news,” he continued, “it is not journalism and it is not news, and yet journalism is now obsessed with it because it is cheap news. It’s like, ‘Oh, I can throw out polls.’ They don’t even discriminate [which polls they choose]. “That is a terrible thing inside a campaign, for people to think that that election was won. Hated inside a campaign.  “There is a difference between people thinking Hillary is three points ahead in the polls, and someone who they think is a god of probability forecasting, saying there is a 94% chance she is winning. Maybe they say, ‘I will have another drink at the bar and not vote. ’” Benenson also pointed to a lack of trust in American institutions, which he blamed on the fallout of the economic crisis, and said Trump’s role as a “quintessential outsider” helped the incoming Republican president. Other factors claimed as reasons for Clinton’s defeat include an alleged failure by the campaign to ensure the support of Hispanic voters. Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) told the Guardian on Saturday that after Trump built his campaign on hardline immigration policies, “we thought this election cycle would be different”.  “Unfortunately,” Palomarez said, “Hillary Clinton was advised once again by Beltway advisers who knew it all, had the models and the projections, but who called it wrong. ” Benenson echoed Clinton, who reportedly told donors in a private conversation that she blamed actions by Comey for her defeat, by pointing a finger at the FBI director, saying Comey’s decision to announce the discovery of new alleged evidence in the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server 11 days before the election “did have an effect”. Benenson said voters who were on the fence about Clinton and contemplating support of   candidates, including Green party candidate Jill Stein, had begun coalescing around Clinton in the last weeks of the election, until the Comey letter went public. “We always had a group that were Trump defectors and a group that were Clinton defectors,” Benenson said.  First, Trump’s defectors began to come back around to the Republican candidate, he said. “And then our defectors started to come home until that Friday, and once that Friday hit, we saw them [go back] to the   candidates,” Benenson said. Comey sent a second letter two days before the election, saying no new evidence of wrongdoing had been found. Benenson said the trend of voters switching allegiance after Comey’s first letter was “significant” in Florida and in Wisconsin, where Stein garnered strong support among liberals and where Clinton lost by one point.",-0.5
"U.S. job openings at record high, skills mismatch emerging.  U. S. job openings surged to a record high in July, but a lag in hiring suggested employers were struggling to find qualified workers to fill the positions.  The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Wednesday also pointed to tightening conditions in the labor market, which could spur faster wage growth.  JOLTS, is one of the job market metrics on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s   dashboard. It was published ahead of the U. S. central bank’s Sept.   policy meeting at which the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. ”There are millions of jobs going begging right now in what has got to be one of the biggest mismatches between skills and lack of qualified help available in the nation’s history,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ”The economy seems strong enough to weather a rate hike.” Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 228, 000 to a seasonally adjusted 5. 9 million, the Labor Department said. That was the highest level since the series started in December 2000 and pushed the jobs openings rate up   of a percentage point to 3. 9 percent in July. Hiring was little changed at 5. 2 million in July, keeping the hiring rate steady at 3. 6 percent for a second straight month. But hiring slowed in August, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 151, 000 jobs, a report showed last week. The economy added a total of 546, 000 jobs in June and July. Although Fed officials view the labor market as being at or near full employment, concerns about persistently low inflation have left the U. S. central bank cautious about raising interest rates in the near term. Job openings were almost across the board. There were big increases in construction, retail, leisure and hospitality, as well as professional and business services.  In a sign of confidence in the labor market, 3. 0 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in July, keeping the quits rate at 2. 1 percent for a second straight month. This rate has rebounded from a low of 1. 3 percent in early 2010. Layoffs were little changed at 1. 6 million in July, holding the layoffs rate at a     low of 1. 1 percent. The ratio of job openings to unemployment hit a   high. ”This suggest wages should be pressured higher and, therefore, either price increases will pick up or profit margins will be squeezed further,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. Despite tightening labor market conditions, wage growth has been frustratingly slow. Average hourly earnings have failed to hold above 2. 5 percent on a    basis. Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3. 5 percent in wages is needed to bring inflation near the Fed’s 2 percent target.

S.  goods fell more than expected in May, but orders for capital equipment were a bit stronger than previously reported, suggesting the manufacturing sector remained on a moderate growth path. U.

"Baltimore looks into Freddie Gray police custody death.  (CNN) More than a week after Freddie Gray was arrested in Baltimore, and a day since he died, authorities are still scrambling to find out exactly what happened and why. ”I’ll tell you what I do know, and right now there’s still a lot of questions I don’t know. I know that when Mr. Gray was placed inside that van, he was able to talk. He was upset. And when Mr. Gray was taken out of that van, he could not talk, and he could not breathe,” Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told reporters Monday. He spoke the same day an autopsy was done on the body of Gray, which showed that he died from a severe injury to his spinal cord. ”What we don’t know, and what we need to get to, is how that injury occurred,” Rodriguez said. The Baltimore Police Department is investigating the death, and has asked for calm as the process unfolds. But many in the community, including the city’s mayor, are angry. ”This is a very, very tense time for Baltimore City, and I understand the community’s frustration. I understand it because I’m frustrated. I’m angry that we are here again    that we have had to tell another mother that their child is dead,” Mayor Stephanie   told reporters. ”I’m frustrated not only that we’re here, but we don’t have all of the answers.” Officers suspended, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that police plan to conclude their investigation by Friday, May 1. From there, the case will go to the state’s attorney’s office, which will decide whether or not to file. Gray was arrested a week ago Sunday. He ”gave up without the use of force,” according to Rodriguez. An officer apparently took his Taser out, and was prepared to use it on Gray, but he never deployed it. ”None of the officers describe using any force against Mr. Gray,” said the deputy police commissioner. A total of six officers were involved in the arrest, and all six have been suspended. Weapon charge, According to documents obtained Monday, Gray was arrested on a weapon charge. While the court documents allege that Baltimore Police Department Officer Garrett Miller arrested Gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket, the Gray family attorney called the allegation a ”sideshow.” Gray was carrying a ”pocket knife of legal size,” attorney William Murphy told CNN. Police never saw the knife and chased Gray only after he took off running, the attorney said.  That seems substantiated by the court documents, which said Gray ”fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.” ”The officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket. The defendant was arrested without force or incident,” the documents say. ”The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted,    knife.” Maryland law makes it illegal to ”wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person,” including switchblades.  But Baltimore’s mayor stressed that simply having a knife is not necessarily a crime. ”It is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone. So, we still have questions,” said  .   Timeline sparks questions, Gray’s death Sunday, following a week of hospitalization, has spurred outrage. At a Monday morning protest outside the Baltimore Police Department, demonstrators   slogans from other   police shootings. They chanted    ”Hands up! Don’t shoot!” and ”I can’t breathe!”    and carried signs saying, ”Stop police terror” and ”Black lives matter.” Sharon Black, one of the rally’s organizers, said police misconduct is routine in Baltimore, and described Gray’s death as the ”straw that broke the camel’s back.” ”The police act in an unrestrained and abusive way,” she said. Gray was in perfect health until police chased and tackled him in Baltimore over a week ago, his lawyer said. Less than an hour later, he was on his way to a trauma clinic with a spinal injury, where he fell into a coma. Two witnesses hit record on their cell phones during what looked to be the   ’s arrest. Police told CNN affiliate WJZ that they also have surveillance video of him.  But there appears to be a gap of some minutes left to account for. Police, according to their own timeline, spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a paddy wagon in fewer than 4 minutes. The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes after that, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before ”units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital.” Gray died Sunday, a full week after the encounter. Police encounter, When cell phones began recording, Gray was already on the ground with three officers kneeling over him. And he let out long, painful screams. Officers had encountered him a minute earlier, police said. They were working an area where drug deals and other crimes are common, Deputy Police Commissioner Rodriguez said. They thought Gray may have been involved in a crime, but there was no evidence that he committed a crime, Gray family attorney Murphy said, and WJZ reported last week that police had not said what their suspicion was.  ”Officers were working in an area that is known for violent crime and drug sales. Officers went to make an encounter with Mr. Gray when he fled from them,” Baltimore Police Department spokesman, Capt. Eric Kowalczyk, said Sunday. Police brutality not on rise coverage is, Pressed on why police initially stopped Gray, Kowalczyk said the department hadn’t released that information because investigators are still conducting interviews.  Painful wailing, When officers approached Gray, he ran. They pursued and caught him quickly, at 8:40 a. m. according to a police timeline.   The officers called for a prisoner transport van. Cell phone video taken from two separate positions showed officers lifting Gray, whose hands were cuffed, up by his shoulders and dragging him to the back of the van.  He legs dangled behind him listlessly as he wailed. Officers put more restraints on Gray inside the van, police said, while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking. The 30 minutes, That was at 8:54 a. m. At 9:24 a. m. police called an ambulance to pick Gray up at the Western District police station. Murphy wants to know what happened in those 30 minutes in between. At some point after his arrest, Gray requested medical attention, said Rodriguez, the deputy police commissioner. Gray also asked for an inhaler, Rodriguez said. The ambulance took Gray to the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Shock Trauma Center. ”He lapsed into a coma, died, was resuscitated, stayed in a coma and on Monday underwent extensive surgery at Shock Trauma to save his life,” Murphy said. ”He clung to life for seven days.” Tubes, wires and supports protruded from Gray as he lay in his hospital bed in a photo Murphy passed on to the media. Officers and Gray investigated,   said that she wants to see a thorough inquiry and that the city will release additional details as investigations are completed. There will be two criminal investigations, said Deputy Commissioner Rodriguez: one to determine if the arresting officers broke the law, and one that pertains to Gray. Police have not grilled the arresting officers on what happened for legal reasons, Rodriguez said. ”We cannot interview an officer administratively and compel them, if an officer is the subject of the criminal investigation. Every person has the right against   so for us to compel an officer to provide a statement, that could potentially taint the criminal investigation,” he said. Investigators will submit their results to an independent review board, he said. There will also be a separate administrative investigation. Family declined meeting, Police officials have attempted to speak with Gray’s relatives to explain the investigation process, Police Commissioner Batts said. But they have declined to meet. ”A mother has lost her son,” Batts said, extending his condolences to the family. He hopes that in interactions between police and residents, everyone goes home safely, he said. ”All lives matter.” Gray had a long history of   with the law. A search of his name brings up more than 20 cases in the Maryland judiciary going back to 2007. They’re mostly   charges, though he was charged with   assault, according to court documents.  He also spent a month in prion in 2013 for drug possession, and he was due in court Friday on another possession charge, Shields said. ",-1.0
"The Philippine President’s Vulgar Warning to Obama.            For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, doesn’t hesitate to swear at public officials in public settings. In May, Duterte called the pope a “son of a whore. ” In June, he responded to criticism from United Nations   Ban   by calling the organization “stupid” and threatening to withdraw “if you are that disrespectful, son of a bitch. ” And this week, Duterte warned that if President Barack Obama asked him about his government’s recent extrajudicial killings, “son of a bitch, I will swear at you. ” Duterte, who took office in late June, made the remarks at a news conference Monday in Manila, the Philippine capital, the Associated Press reported. More than 2, 000 alleged drug deals and users have been killed since Duterte launched a crackdown on illegal drug trafficking after assuming office, prompting strong condemnation from the United Nations and   groups. “I am a president of a sovereign state and we have long ceased to be a colony. I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody,” Duterte told reporters. “You must be respectful. Do not just throw questions. Putang ina, I will swear at you in that forum. ” “Putang ina” is the Tagalog phrase for son of a bitch. Duterte spoke before he was scheduled to fly to Laos for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. Obama arrived in Laos Sunday for the summit, becoming the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Southeast Asian country. Duterte and Obama were scheduled to meet there this week, but Duterte’s comments may change that. Obama said Monday night he had been informed of Duterte’s remarks, and instructed his staff to speak with their Philippine counterparts “to find out if this, in fact, a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations. ” “I have seen some of those colorful statements in the past, and so, clearly, he’s a colorful guy,” the president said during a news conference in Hangzhou, China, after the Group of 20 Summit there. He called the Philippines an ally, and said his relationship with the Philippine people has been “extraordinarily warm and productive. ” Last month, the U. S. State Department publicly expressed concern over the Philippine government’s detention of alleged drug dealers. Also last month, Duterte made a homophobic slur in Tagalog against Philip Goldberg, the U. S. ambassador to the Philippines, and called him “the son of a whore” in televised remarks. Obama said Monday he would bring up Duterte’s war on drugs should the two leaders meet. “We recognize the significant burden that the drug trade plays just not just in the Philippines, but around the world,” he said. But “we will always assert the need to have due process and to engage in that fight against drugs in a way that’s consistent with basic international norms. And so, undoubtedly, if and when we have a meeting, that this is something that’s going to be brought up, and my expectation, my hope is, is that it could be dealt with constructively. ” 	A bartender’s camera captures the seedy street life of retro New York.",-0.5
"The Baton Rouge Police Shooting: What We Know. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. What we know on Monday:  —  Louisiana State Police have identified the gunman who on Sunday killed three officers and wounded three others as Gavin Long of Missouri. Long was killed in the   with police.    —  Details about the shooting —  such as the motive for it —  at a convenience store near the Baton Rouge Police Department’s headquarters, are still scarce.  —  The incident comes less than two weeks after Alton Sterling’s shooting death by Baton Rouge police officers on July 5, sparking both local and national protests. There’s no evidence of a connection between the two events so far.  —  We’re   the major updates. All updates are in Eastern Daylight Time (GMT  ). 8:11 a. m. Mike Edmonson, the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, has told reporters this morning that the gunman’s “movements, his direction, his attention was on police officers. ” Using the word “ambush” to describe the attack that killed three officers, Edmonson said the gunman “certainly was seeking out police officers. ” He declined to elaborate.  The gunman, as we reported earlier this morning, has been identified as Gavin Long, a former Marine from Kansas City, Missouri. July 18 at 7:23 a. m. Louisiana State Police on Monday definitively identified the gunman as Gavin Long of Missouri. Multiple news reports say he is a former U. S. Marine from Kansas City, Missouri. Long was black and Sunday, the day of the shooting, was his 29th birthday. Here’s The New York Times: According to military records released by the Marine Corps, Mr. Long served as a data network specialist and was a sergeant when he left the Marines in 2010. He enlisted in his hometown, Kansas City, Mo. in 2005, and was deployed to Iraq from June 2008 to January 2009, his records show. They also show a number of commendations, including the Good Conduct Medal. On a social media site registered under the name Gavin Long, a young   man who refers to himself as “Cosmo” posted videos and podcasts and shared biographical and personal information that aligned with the information that the authorities had released, so far, about the gunman. In one video, posted on YouTube, the man promotes violence as a response to the deaths of young black men at the hands of the police. The Kansas City Star has more details about Long, including on the his high school years. Authorities have identified those officers who were shot on Sunday. They are Montrell Jackson, 32, a   veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department Matthew Gerald, 41, who had been with the department for less than a year and Brad Garafola, 45, a East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s deputy.

Though we don’t know the exact circumstances of the shooting, our colleague J. Weston Phippen wrote a piece last week about the occasions in which police have deliberately been targeted, resulting in changes to how departments around the country work. “Over the past 50 years, four officers have died on a single day on three separate occasions —  most recently in 2009,” Weston wrote. He added: After each of these killings, police departments across the country asked what could have been done differently to protect officers. But it was one day in 1970 when four officers were killed that had the most impact on that question. The incident is known as the Newhall Massacre, named for the town where two criminals murdered four California Highway Patrol officers, about an hour north of Los Angeles. From that April day forward, the U. S. taught its officers to be more cautious, and it trained police in tactics that reflected this new attitude. Shooting deaths of police officers have dropped steadily since the 1970s, in large part because of Newhall. The full article is worth reading. 11:55 a. m.

A gunman reportedly shot multiple police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Sunday. At least two Baton Rouge police officers are dead after the shooting, The Advocate reported, citing   officials.

"New iPad mini and entry-level iPad are around the corner – TechCrunch. Apple has registered new iPad models in the Eurasian Economic Commission reference database. The Moscow-based commission keeps a product database pretty much like the FCC in the U.S. And it sounds like Apple is about to launch a new iPad mini 5 and an updated entry-level iPad. That database has shown information on new Apple products in the past — MySmartPrice first discovered today’s new filings. There are two different filings that both mention new tablets that run iOS 12. The first filing mentions five different models, while the second one mentions two different models. Usually, each configuration gets a different model number depending on storage and LTE capabilities. It lines up with previous rumors that mentioned a new iPad mini and a new cheap iPad for early 2019. Ming-Chi Kuo expects an updated iPad mini with a 7.9-inch display. The device hasn’t been updated for years and many believed that Apple would stop updating it. But if you still like that form factor, Apple may have something new for you. When it comes to the normal-size iPad, Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad in March 2018. While all eyes are on the iPad Pro, many people are still looking for the cheapest iPad they can get. And the $329 9.7-inch iPad is a good deal. Apple usually updates that model every year. Today’s filings don’t say what those devices will look like, unfortunately. It’s unclear if Apple is going to reduce the bezels of those devices, add a Face ID sensor or switch to USB-C.",0.0
"Former Guantanamo prisoner vanishes in South America, prompting search.  A former Guantanamo Bay prison living in Uruguay has vanished under mysterious circumstances, The Washington Post reports. Law enforcement is now searching for the former detainee, Jihad Ahmed Mustafa Dhiab, a Syrian national, the paper reported Friday, citing a U. S. official. “We are coordinating with officials in Brazil and Uruguay to determine his whereabouts,” the official told the paper on background to discuss a sensitive incident. Officials believe Dhiab, imprisoned at Guantanamo in 2002 for suspected ties to al Qaeda, may have entered Brazil illegally. According to Uruguayan media, the country’s interior minister said Thursday Dhiab’s can make international trips, but Brazil hasn’t allowed him to enter the country previously, the Post reported. Just this week the Senate passed a defense spending bill that bars shuttering the Guantanamo prison in Cuba. The debate over closing Guantanamo, which President Obama has pledged to do since taking office, could intensify if Dhiab’s disappearance is confirmed. Another Uruguayan government official told the Associated Press that Dhiab traveled legally to Brazil, according to the Post. He hasn’t been seen since June 6, a Brazilian online news outlet, Plus55. com, reported Friday. “If Brazilian authorities didn’t allow his legal entry, they can send Dhiab back to Uruguay, but that’s a problem for Brazil,” the news outlet quoted Uruguayan Interior Minister Eduardo Bonomi as saying. Dhiab went to Uruguay with five other Guantanamo Bay prisoners in 2014 in a deal between the south American country and Uruguay and the U. S. to resettle detainees seen as posing little threat. He spent 12 years at Guantanamo without being charged after his capture in Pakistan. Guantanamo still holds 80 prisoners. Click here for more from the Washington Post.",1.0
"Who Will Control Colombia’s Cocaine Without FARC?.    I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Last week Colombian and FARC leaders shook hands in Havana. It was the first tangible promise of peace in a half century. But despite this, 170, 000 acres of an   plant still threatens violence. The   between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) ended a   war that killed 250, 000 people, and displaced 6 million, a population twice the size of Chicago. Barring the unpredictable, the 8, 000 FARC soldiers who have lived and killed in the jungle will soon put down their weapons and relinquish control of 60 percent of the world’s   coca crops. It’s unclear what exactly will happen to the coca fields when FARC leaves. The government hopes the Marxist guerrilla group will help farmers transition from coca to another crop, leading to a tranquility that’s been absent from rural Colombia since bands of poor farmers fled to the mountains in 1948. But FARC’s absence could also create a vacuum that any number of other criminal groups already in the jungle may seek to fill, giving rise to more violence. FARC operates in 25 of Colombia’s 32 provinces. When it’s time to demobilize, its soldiers will come to designated safety zones where they will surrender their  guns, and begin the   process of reintegration, something that will be tough for the individual guerrilla. “It implies a whole different life for us, a different regime,” Alberto Camacho, a FARC commander, told The Guardian. “We have been living in boots for so long. ” It will also be tough for FARC to extricate itself from the cocaine business, which has earned it anywhere between $200 million and $3. 5 billion a year. FARC has never admitted its full involvement in the drugs trade. It began as a political movement, when a group of communist farmers ran to the mountains to protect themselves from the government. In the 1950s, nearly all of Colombia had split into armed political factions, and the government saw the farmers’ Marxist ideology as a threat. The farmers fought back and their action gave birth to FARC and an armed rebellion. At its peak, FARC claimed 20, 000 fighters. And it owes its success and survival to the money brought in through kidnapping, extortion, and beginning in the early 1980s, cocaine. Although growing coca in Colombia is illegal, poor farmers cultivated it because by the time they transported their legal crops and fruits to the markets from their remote towns and villages through the dense forests, the transportations costs eroded any profit margin. “But with coca,” Jeremy McDermott,   of Insight Crime, told me, “the buyer will come to your house. ” Two years ago, McDermott, who lives in Medellin, wrote about FARC’s ties to cocaine in an article titled “The FARC and the Drug Trade: Siamese Twins?” In it, he wrote FARC taxes farmers $50 per kilo of cocaine and criminal organizations $200 per kilo. It charges $100 per kilo to the laboratories that soak the green leaves in kerosene to extract the alkaloids that 1. 5 million U. S. cocaine users regularly snort. FARC charges airplanes that transports the drugs from its territory, and has even shipped cocaine itself. FARC soldiers work in units called fronts, which are its fighting blocs. Each is responsible for itself, but answers to the Secretariat, the rebel group’s governing body. The jungle is vast and the guerrillas use the small towns spread in the countryside as bases of operation. For that reason, and because of the nature of being a rebel group hiding from the Colombian government, FARC’s central command can’t oversee everything. One fear is that after peace, autonomous fronts will stay put in the jungle, having forged their own relationships with mafia and cartels, completely able to oversee the growth, manufacture, and shipment of cocaine. “That is the ‘FACRIM’ scenario,” McDermott told me. That term is something McDermott coined based on another armed rebel force that disbanded and turned into fractured criminal groups. They are now collectively called BACRIM, a combination of “bandas criminales,” Spanish for criminal bands. Most of the BACRIM began as the United   Forces of Colombia (AUC) a   group supported by both drug dealers and the Colombian army. For a while, the government found AUC useful. In the 1990s and early 2000s, it hunted and killed FARC members. But the U. S. later labeled it a terrorist organization —  like FARC —  and by 2006 it had largely demobilized. Some of its fighters remained in the jungle, and these groups now buy cocaine from   growers. Another possibility is that FARC soldiers with a stronger desire to hold onto their fields rather than make peace could take their   and their holdings to the National Liberation Army (ELN) another communist guerrilla group with a similar history. The ELN was founded in the 1960s and headed for a long time by leftist Roman Catholic priests. It’s now a designated terrorist organization with ties to drug smugglers. Although ideologically similar,  ELN and FARC have not always gotten along, but they formed a loose alliance after 2008. Coca farmers have been able to grow in relative comfort because of FARC’s protection, in exchange for a fee. If FARC leaves, ELN could slip into this role, bolstered by FARC’s dissident blocs. The ELN is also in peace talks with the government, although they are not as far along. This could mean the ELN also bows out of the cocaine business, leaving it to others. And that could lead to the scenario with the greatest likelihood for violence, which is one where no one clearly controls the cocaine. Convincing farmers to grow bananas instead of coca is an entirely different battle. Those who’ve tried to make the switch often find they earn   of what they did growing coca. The government says it plans to subsidize these farmers, weaning them onto another crop. That will take time. And when the FARC drops its weapons, it will leave behind a desirable void, a vacuum of control worth billions. “How do you fill the vacuum in these areas where the criminal economy makes up 70 percent of the whole economy? ,” McDermott asked. That’s what the Colombian government is trying to figure out now that the most stabilizing force in those areas, FARC, is preparing to leave. The most optimistic future is one in which FARC uses its influence to ease farmers into legitimate crops. But it will be difficult: In 2014 Colombians planted 44 percent more coca plants than the year before. Last year, they likely planted even more. Cocaine has been big business for decades. Then again, it was just nine years ago that FARC doubled down on attacks against the government. Now there’s peace for the first time in a   so it seems anything is possible.   ",-0.5

"Why Do You Want a Pet? Can You Afford It? - The New York Times. Americans love their pets.   of all households in the United States have at least one. That includes 86 million cats and 78 million dogs, according to the American Pet Products Association, and the total climbs to 310 million when you include all the birds, fish, small animals, horses and reptiles. But suppose you are in the minority. Should you get a pet? Here’s a checklist. Philip Tedeschi, the executive director of the Institute for   Connection at the University of Denver, said the motives for getting a pet could be complex. If you don’t fully understand the reasons, that can lead to problems. For instance, a   owner driven by profound loneliness or isolation might be incapable of evaluating whether the pet is being treated properly. Owners have to be aware of their pet’s social and emotional needs. Otherwise the animal might behave in an antisocial or   way. “The old adage that you have to love yourself to love someone else or that you need to be healthy to be in a healthy relationship can apply to our relationships with animals,” he said. The average cost of veterinary care per household in 2011 was $375, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Consider, too, the costs of unforeseen illnesses or injuries and the need for extra care. Add food, boarding, grooming and toys, and you can expect to tack on several hundred dollars more a year in expenses. When it comes to adopting a dog or a cat, “you will probably have this pet longer than your car, your job and possibly even longer than your current relationship,” said Arden Moore, who hosts “Oh Behave,” a podcast on Pet Life Radio. • Is anyone at home allergic to animals? • How tolerant are you about shedding, dander and pet messes? How much do you value an immaculate home? • Are there children at home? If so, how old are they? Will they be compatible with a pet? • Where will you get your pet? People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recommends rescuing stray animals or adopting from a shelter. • Do you live in an apartment or a house? Can you provide the amount of space that a pet will need to be comfortable? • Do you have friends, neighbors or relatives who could look after your pet while you are away? • Would your lifestyle and work schedule allow you adequate time to interact with your pet?

"Nearly Four-Fifths of White Evangelicals Say They’ll Vote for Donald Trump - The New York Times. Nearly   of white evangelical voters plan to cast their ballots for Donald J. Trump despite his multiple marriages, lack of piety and inconsistency on the issues they care about most, a new poll has found. Support for Mr. Trump among white evangelicals is even stronger than it was four years ago for Mitt Romney, the previous Republican nominee for president, according to the poll of religious voters, released on Tuesday by the Pew Research Center. White evangelicals make up about   of all registered voters and are a coveted bloc who, when energized, can turn out the vote through their churches and social networks. It has been unclear to what extent Mr. Trump will be able to capture this core Republican constituency, because some leading evangelicals have spoken of being disturbed by his penchant for boasting about himself and belittling others, his pledges to deport Mexican immigrants and bar Muslims from entering the country, and his past support for abortion rights and gay rights. Some influential evangelical leaders have joined the “Never Trump” camp, while others have pledged support for Mr. Trump. More came on board after he wooed about 1, 000 of them in a   meeting in New York. “Trump is not a true believer in any sense, both religiously and on the issues, but he’s speaking to them,” said J. Tobin Grant, a professor of political science at Southern Illinois   and a columnist at the Religion News Service. “He’s actively courting them, and that’s what the activists want. They want to have a seat at the table, and they felt they didn’t have that with Romney. ” The poll also found that Roman Catholics favored Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, over Mr. Trump by 17 percentage points  —   a significant shift from the 2012 presidential race, when Election Day exit polls showed Catholics split almost evenly between Mr. Romney and the Democratic incumbent, President Obama. The change is largely because of the support of Hispanic Catholics, who make up about   of Roman Catholics in the United States and favor Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump by an overwhelming 77 percent to 16 percent. White Catholics narrowly favor Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, 50 to 46 percent, but Mrs. Clinton has a   advantage among all Catholics who say they attend Mass weekly. Black Protestants are firmly in Mrs. Clinton’s camp, and white mainline Protestants favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton, 50 to 39 percent. The survey did not show results for members of minority religious groups, like Buddhists, Hindus, Jews and Muslims, because there were not enough of them in the poll. The survey found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump decisively in a   contest, 51 to 42 percent. Mrs. Clinton has solid support from voters who claim no religion  —   a cohort known as the “nones,” according to the poll. This group has grown rapidly in recent years, and now makes up about   of registered voters  —   about the same share of the electorate as white evangelicals. Religiously unaffiliated voters back Mrs. Clinton by 68 percent to 26 percent, but their support is softer than evangelicals’ support for Mr. Trump. The poll found that 36 percent of white evangelicals said they strongly supported Mr. Trump, while in June 2012, just 26 percent said they strongly supported Mr. Romney. Mr. Romney faced resistance from some evangelicals because of his Mormon faith. Mr. Trump is a member of the Presbyterian Church U. S. A. a liberal mainline Protestant denomination, has demonstrated little fluency in the Bible or Christianity, and has said that he has never asked God for forgiveness. But the poll showed that voters in general, including evangelicals, were dissatisfied with their options this year.   percent of white evangelical voters said it would be difficult to choose between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton because “neither one” would make a good president. In fact, the survey found that the desire to defeat Mrs. Clinton was the prime reason evangelicals supported Mr. Trump. Of the 78 percent of white evangelicals who said they would vote for Mr. Trump, 45 percent said their decision was “mainly a vote against Clinton,” while only 30 percent said it was “mainly a vote for Trump. ”",-1.0
"Donald Trump Could Threaten U.S. Rule of Law, Scholars Say - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   Donald J. Trump’s blustery attacks on the press, complaints about the judicial system and bold claims of presidential power collectively sketch out a constitutional worldview that shows contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law, legal experts across the political spectrum say. Even as much of the Republican political establishment lines up behind its presumptive nominee, many conservative and libertarian legal scholars warn that electing Mr. Trump is a recipe for a constitutional crisis. “Who knows what Donald Trump with a pen and phone would do?” asked Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. With five months to go before Election Day, Mr. Trump has already said he would “loosen” libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations. He has threatened to sic federal regulators on his critics. He has encouraged rough treatment of demonstrators. His proposal to bar Muslims from entry into the country tests the Constitution’s guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection. And, in what was a tipping point for some, he attacked Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of the Federal District Court in San Diego, who is overseeing two class actions against Trump University. Mr. Trump accused the judge of bias, falsely said he was Mexican and seemed to issue a threat. “They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace,” Mr. Trump said. “O. K.? But we will come back in November. Wouldn’t that be wild if I am president and come back and do a civil case?” David Post, a retired law professor who now writes for the Volokh Conspiracy, a   law blog, said those comments had crossed a line. “This is how authoritarianism starts, with a president who does not respect the judiciary,” Mr. Post said. “You can criticize the judicial system, you can criticize individual cases, you can criticize individual judges. But the president has to be clear that the law is the law and that he enforces the law. That is his constitutional obligation. ” “If he is signaling that that is not his position, that’s a very serious constitutional problem,” Mr. Post said. Beyond the attack on judicial independence is a broader question of Mr. Trump’s commitment to the separation of powers and to the principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution. Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown and an architect of the first major challenge to President Obama’s health care law, said he had grave doubts on both fronts. “You would like a president with some idea about constitutional limits on presidential powers, on congressional powers, on federal powers,” Professor Barnett said, “and I doubt he has any awareness of such limits. ” Republican leaders say they are confident that Mr. Trump would respect the rule of law if elected. “He’ll have a White House counsel,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told Hugh Hewitt, the radio host, on Monday. “There will be others who point out there’s certain things you can do and you can’t do. ” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has become a reluctant supporter of Mr. Trump, said he did not believe that the nation would be in danger under his presidency. “I still believe we have the institutions of government that would restrain someone who seeks to exceed their constitutional obligations,” Mr. McCain said. “We have a Congress. We have the Supreme Court. We’re not Romania. ” “Our institutions, including the press, are still strong enough to prevent” unconstitutional acts, he said. Mr. Post said that view was too sanguine, given the executive branch’s practical primacy. “The president has all the power with respect to enforcing the law,” he said. “There’s only one of those three branches that actually has the guns in its hands, and that’s the executive. ” Republican officials have criticized Mr. Obama for what they have called his unconstitutional expansion of executive power. But some legal scholars who share that view say the problem under a President Trump would be worse. “I don’t think he cares about separation of powers at all,” said Richard Epstein, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who also teaches at New York University and the University of Chicago. President George W. Bush “often went beyond what he should have done,” Professor Epstein said. “I think Obama’s been much worse on that issue pretty consistently, and his underlings have been even more so. But I think Trump doesn’t even think there’s an issue to worry about. He just simply says whatever I want to do I will do. ” Mr. Trump has boasted that he will use Mr. Obama’s actions as precedent for his own expansive assertions of executive power. “He’s led the way, to be honest with you,” he said in January on “Meet the Press,” referring to Mr. Obama’s program to spare millions of immigrants in the country unlawfully from deportation. “But I’m going to use them much better, and they’re going to serve a much better purpose than what he’s done. ” But Mr. Post said there was a difference between Mr. Obama’s view of executive power and that of Mr. Trump. “Whatever you think of Obama’s position on immigration, he is willing to submit to the courts,” he said. “There is no suggestion that he will disobey if the courts rule against him. ” Several law professors said they were less sure about Mr. Trump, citing the actions of another populist, President Andrew Jackson, who refused to enforce an 1832 Supreme Court decision arising from a clash between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation. “I can easily see a situation in which he would take the Andrew Jackson line,” Professor Epstein said, referring to a probably apocryphal comment attributed to Jackson about Chief Justice John Marshall: “John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it. ” There are other precedents, said John C. Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who took an expansive view of executive power as a lawyer in the Bush administration. “The only two other presidents I can think of who were so hostile to judges on an individual level and to the judiciary as a whole would be Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt,” he said. Both of those presidents chafed at what they saw as excessive judicial power. “But they weren’t doing it because they had cases before those judges as individuals,” Professor Yoo said. “They had legitimate    fights between the presidency and the judiciary. Trump is lashing out because he has a lawsuit in a private capacity, which is much more disturbing. ” Other legal scholars said they were worried about Mr. Trump’s commitment to the First Amendment. He has taken particular aim at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. “He owns Amazon,” Mr. Trump said in February. “He wants political influence so Amazon will benefit from it. That’s not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems. They’re going to have such problems. ” More generally, Mr. Trump has discussed revising libel laws to make it easier to sue over critical coverage. “I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,” Mr. Trump said in February. “We’re going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when The Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected. ” On one hand, Mr. Trump seemed to misunderstand the scope of presidential power. Libel is a   tort constrained by First Amendment principles, and a president’s views do not figure in its application. On the other hand, said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, Mr. Trump’s comments betrayed a troubling disregard for free expression. “There are very few serious constitutional thinkers who believe public figures should be able to use libel as indiscriminately as Trump seems to think they should,” Professor Somin said. “He poses a serious threat to the press and the First Amendment. ” Many of Mr. Trump’s statements about legal issues were extemporaneous and resist conventional legal analysis. Some seemed to betray ignorance of fundamental legal concepts, as when he said in a debate that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had criticized Mr. Trump’s sister, a federal appeals court judge, “for signing a certain bill,” adding for good measure that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. while still an appeals court judge, had also “signed that bill. ” But bills are legislative rather than judicial documents. And, as it happened, Judge Alito had not joined the opinion in question. Asked on “Good Morning America” in March about whom he would name to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said he would “probably appoint people that would look very seriously at” Hillary Clinton’s “email disaster because it’s criminal activity. ” In the constitutional structure, however, Supreme Court justices are neither investigators nor prosecutors. When Mr. Trump recently released a list of his potential Supreme Court nominees, conservative and libertarian scholars were heartened, but only to a point. “It was a tremendous list, a great list,” said Mr. Shapiro, from the Cato Institute. “Who knows how much you can trust the list?”",-1.0
"UCLA Shooter Entered U.S. on Foreign Student Visa In 2001. UCLA shooting suspect Mainak Sarkar came to the United States on a foreign student visa in 2001 after graduating from a prestigious Indian technology university and was granted permanent legal status in the U. S. in 2014. [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued the following statement to Breitbart News on Thursday afternoon regarding Sarkar’s legal status in the country:  Department of Homeland Security databases indicate that Mr. Sarkar was in the United States lawfully at the time of his death, having been granted lawful permanent residence in May 2014. According to DHS databases, Mr. Sarkar originally came to the U. S. in 2001 on a foreign student visa to pursue graduate studies. DHS’ electronic records show he obtained three student visas between 2001 and 2008 to engage in masters and doctoral programs in the U. S. After the December 2 terror attack in San Bernardino perpetrated by   fiancée visa recipient Tashfeen Malik and her husband, U. S. citizen Syed Rizwan Farook, serious questions arose over the vetting of those granted visas to the United States. It was discovered after the attack that Malik and Farook may never have even met before she came to the U. S. as required for the visa to be approved. Sarkar graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in 2000 with a degree in aerospace engineering, according to the Los Angeles Times. The IIT has been criticized for diminishing quality in recent years. The Times reported, “The intense pressure for success has resulted in a growing mental health crisis at top Indian educational institutions, including IIT. ” Reports indicate 57 aspiring IIT students have committed suicide in the last five years. The motives for Sarkar’s alleged murder suicide at UCLA on Wednesday are still under investigation. Police are said to be looking into Sarkar’s grades and relationship with the professor he is accused of murdering, William Klug. Police did find what is being described as Sarkar’s “kill list” at his Minnesota home, spelling out the names of three people. Klug’s name was on the list, as well as the name of a woman who has since been found dead. CNN reported that Deputy Police Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park, Minnesota Police Department told reporters on Thursday that they had found her on Thursday, but that it appears she was shot before Wednesday’s UCLA shooting.

"Why Michael Flynn likely won’t face charges under the Logan Act.  (CNN) Michael Flynn is out as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser. But does he have bigger problems than just needing a new job? At issue is the   Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments. Some vocal critics have suggested Flynn could be prosecuted for violating the statute. But no one has previously been prosecuted under the law, and no one in the law enforcement community has suggested Flynn would be. Here’s a look at the law: What is the Logan Act? The Logan Act forbids private citizens ”without authority of the United States” from negotiating with foreign governments with an ”intent to influence” measures or conduct of that government regarding any ”disputes or controversies.” Congress passed it in 1799 in response to the actions of George Logan, a Pennsylvania doctor who went to France as a private citizen and tried to negotiate with officials there, according to the Congressional Research Service. The legal bottom line here: Only the President and the President’s authorized emissaries have the power to negotiate with other countries. What does it have to do with Flynn?  As a member of Trump’s transition team, Flynn spoke by phone on December 29 with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The calls happened as President Barack Obama’s administration was issuing sanctions against Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 US election. When news of Flynn’s phone calls became public in January, administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, said the conversations focused on logistics, not sanctions. ”They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence told CBS. But US investigators looked into the claim, and the Justice Department last month warned the Trump administration that Flynn had misled administration officials about his communications with Kislyak and could be vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians.  The White House stood behind Flynn    until it didn’t. The retired Army lieutenant general resigned Monday night, admitting he had ”inadvertently briefed the vice   and others with incomplete information” about the Kislyak phone calls. Did Flynn break the law? This case hits several key aspects of the Logan Act: 1. whether Flynn had ”authority” to participate in the phone calls 2. whether conversations related to a ”dispute or controversy” and 3. whether he had an ”intent to influence” a foreign government. Let’s break those down: There’s no evidence Flynn, as an adviser at the time to   Trump, had authority from Obama to speak with foreign officials. A US official confirms that Flynn and Kislyak did speak about sanctions. The exact context of Flynn’s side of the conversation was not clear, even to the FBI and intelligence groups that reviewed the content, a US official told CNN. Given that third point, it’s unclear whether Flynn’s conversations related to a ”dispute or controversy,” or whether he had an ”intent to influence” a foreign government. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday said the White House counsel looked into the situation and found no ”legal” issue with the phone calls. ”The question is not whether he did anything improper or illegal,” Spicer said. ”It was not an issue of law it was an issue of trust.” Some FBI and Justice Department officials have told CNN the phone calls are not likely to lead to any criminal charges. Several senators have called for an investigation into Flynn and the Trump administration more broadly to learn what was said in those phone calls, along with who knew about their content and when. What about past Logan Act cases?  Here’s the rub. The    Logan Act has almost no track record, and no one has ever been prosecuted under it.  Only once, in 1803, was someone even indicted: a Kentucky farmer who wrote an article advocating for a separate Western nation allied with France. But the Louisiana Purchase later that year made the matter obsolete, the Congressional Research Service reported. The Logan Act ”is a relic of a bygone era,” said Steve Vladeck, a CNN contributor and law professor at University of Texas School of Law. Still, threats of prosecution pop up every few years: President Ronald Reagan accused the Rev. Jesse Jackson of violating the act in 1984 when Jackson visited Moscow in an attempt to secure the release of a dissident. Two years ago, 47 Republican senators signed an open letter to Iran’s officials declaring their opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. Critics suggested that may have violated the Logan Act. ”It gets trotted out every time there’s a political disagreement when someone who is not the president touches on foreign policy,” Vladeck said. ”It’s the old chestnut that everyone quotes and no one understands.” So will Flynn face Logan Act charges? The Logan Act likely won’t be used here, and it may not even be enforceable at all anymore, Vladeck said. The law essentially criminalizes speech, he said, and the Supreme Court looks very skeptically at laws that may infringe upon that right. In addition, the law’s mention of a person acting ”without authority of the United States” could be an escape hatch, Vladeck has written. Flynn wasn’t simply a private citizen he was an adviser to the   and soon would be given diplomatic powers. Legally speaking, his role may have granted him the ”authority” to talk sanctions with Kislyak, Vladeck’s interpretation suggests.  What about other laws?  While the Logan Act likely won’t be an issue, Flynn could face other legal challenges related to the phone calls. ”The real question is whether Flynn made false comments to any investigators,” Vladeck said. ”But no, the Logan Act, I think, is full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.” Could other officials face charges? It’s too early to say.  A number of Democratic and Republican senators have called for an investigation into President Trump’s connections with Russia and want Flynn to testify as part of that inquiry. ”What did (Trump) know about Flynn’s dealings (with) Russians and when did he know it?” David Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator and a former senior Obama adviser, asked on Twitter. Separately, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, wants an investigation into the leaks surrounding Flynn’s phone call. Trump tweeted that the leaks are the ”real story here.”",-1.0

For example, you could type “I want news on Microsoft and Apple” to find news that specifically mentions both companies. Another example would be “show me news about Messenger and bots.” 3) Conversational negation This allows you to exclude certain items in your search. For example, if you wanted to see news about Amazon but didn’t want to see anything about Whole Foods you could type “I want news about Amazon but not Whole Foods.” Another example would be “show me news about Apple but not iPhones.” We’re also looking into adding some other updates, including conversational pagination and video search. There’s also a possibility that we might bring this bot to Slack. More to come soon. You can check out our new and improved Messenger bot here.",0.0
"Sheriff David Clarke gets it wrong about Pittsburgh | TheHill. These are difficult times for our country. Hatred and fear spreading like wildfire against cities like Pittsburgh that were — and still are — being built upon the shoulders of immigrants. Luckily such cities are standing as a bulwark against such assaults, which are an affront to the U.S. Constitution and our nation’s history. Lately, my city and I have been attacked in The Hill by Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman Rob Gleason for our efforts to balance law enforcement needs with the constitutional rights of residents. Sheriff David Clarke even called for the prosecution of elected officials like me who don’t agree with him on immigration policy — going so far as to call us “sacrificial lambs” — and for local law enforcement officers to work as a national federalized army that takes orders from on high in Washington D.C. Since declaring our independence 240 years ago, our democratically-elected republic has repeatedly been tested, and dark times are facing us once again. It would be clearly unconstitutional for any administration to threaten government officials that do not agree with them on policies, and I and other city officials nationwide would vehemently fight such calls, just as some 400 cities came together to fight attacks on civil liberties included in the Patriot Act a decade ago. The attacks on Pittsburgh for its work with immigrants show an ignorance not only of our law enforcement procedures, but of standards that have long made our country truly great: a reliance on the good works immigrants bring to the United States, and the constitutional rights that protect them. The immigrant story is my story, and Pittsburgh’s story. My grandfather emigrated from Italy to work in Pittsburgh’s storied steel mills, join a union, and become part of our nation’s emergent middle class. In the 1970s when the steel industry collapsed, my city all but died and so did the jobs my family and friends relied on. But slowly, something special brought us back: a commitment to research and development fueled by institutions like Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, which again were places fueled by brainpower and hard work of newcomers to our city, many of them immigrants.  As a result Pittsburgh is now recognized internationally for its 21st Century economy, and for being one of the best cities in the entire world to live. Tyrants have been threatening good people for centuries. But places like Pittsburgh are committed to fighting for the values of the Constitution, which protects us from tyrants and from undue prosecution, and was written to keep our nation from being ruled by an authoritarian empire. The true American patriots reside in cities like Pittsburgh, which stand for what this country was built upon. We’re guided in this respect by the words of Pennsylvania’s native son and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither.” Don’t believe me?  Just look at the Democratic mayors who spoke out against the President Barack ObamaBarack Hussein ObamaDick Cheney to attend fundraiser supporting Trump reelection: report Forget conventional wisdom — Bernie Sanders is electable 2020 Democrats fight to claim Obama's mantle on health care MORE’s support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, despite heavy lobbying against us. In Pittsburgh, we fight for what is right, and will continue to do so, in the face of whatever pressures the incoming Administration tries to bring upon us. Furthermore, those who actually check the facts on Pittsburgh’s policies — which unfortunately seems to happen rarely among some these days — would see the balance my city has reached to both protect safety and uphold constitutional rights. In 2014, my first year in office, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police adopted a policy to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers: Pittsburgh officers – as they do with all federal law enforcement personnel — are directed to work with the ICE to help detain all those formally determined to be subject to criminal investigations. At the same time our police do not engage in investigatory detention of citizens based merely on allegations regarding their immigration status. To do so is not only unconstitutional but would unduly divert precious resources our local police need to perform their duties protecting Pittsburgh residents, investigating crimes, and building ties within city neighborhoods. Pittsburgh and other cities have realized that working with immigrant communities to build trust with local law enforcement — rather than seeding fear and mistrust, as some would like — helps fight crime. We have found that being welcoming to immigrants further helps build our economy, draws students and academics to our universities and hospitals, and adds quality of life to our neighborhoods. A study last year showed three-fourths of the patents awarded from top universities had at least one foreign-born inventor. And this year all six U.S. winners of Nobel Prizes in economics and science were immigrants. Just as previous generations built our industries through their arms and backs, the new wave of immigrants is changing our country for the better through the power of their minds. The Pittsburgh in which I and my immigrant family settled believes in the rights of the U.S. Constitution and the values upon which this country was founded.  That includes the principles of having a federal army to protect us from enemies both foreign and domestic; having Second Amendment rights to a well-regulated militia and the right to bear arms; and the rights for states to create local governments that are free to create and enforce their own policies, laws and regulations particular to their needs. Those rights should never be taken from our cities, towns and villages: not by this incoming Administration, and not by any. Finally, in a world increasingly divided by hate, we in Pittsburgh are committed to love, and guided by the words of our beloved Fred Rogers. We must “stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive,” Mr. Rogers said. “Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed.” William Peduto is the mayor of Pittsburgh.

"In China, State Media Blast Tillerson’s Comments On South China Sea Islands. After   Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state made strong statements about China’s actions in the South China Sea, Chinese officials have responded with muted, measured statements  —   while   media have warned of the potential for conflict and retaliation. Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil CEO nominated to lead the U. S. State Department, had a confirmation hearing Wednesday. He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China’s actions in the South China Sea were ”extremely worrisome” and compared them to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Beijing has claimed most of the South China Sea as its territory, a stance rejected by an international tribunal. China has also built artificial islands with military capabilities in the disputed territory. The U. S. has declined to take an official position on the competing claims, but periodically patrols the waters and emphasizes the need for international freedom of movement. Tillerson said the situation was a potential ”threat to the entire global economy.” Asked Wednesday whether he supports a more aggressive U. S. posture in the South China Sea, Tillerson said, ”You’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed.” Tillerson also sharply criticized China for failing to dissuade North Korea over its nuclear program. He said the U. S. ”cannot continue to accept empty promises like the ones China has made to pressure North Korea to reform.” ”Such rhetoric from Washington isn’t surprising,” The Associated Press notes. ”Past U. S. administrations have entered office seeking to get tougher on China, and failed.” China’s official response has been to play down the significance of Tillerson’s remarks, the AP reports: ”Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions in [the South China Sea] had lessened and countries from outside the region should support efforts toward stability. ” . S. relations are based on ’    mutual benefit and   cooperation,’ Lu said at a daily briefing. ”If you take a look at [Chinese] President Xi Jinping’s call with Donald Trump after he won the election, you can see that the two countries do respect each other, and we agree with him that we should develop our relations based on mutual respect,’ he said.” But opinion pieces in   media have been blunt. An   in China Daily said Tillerson displayed ”undisguised animosity toward China”: ”Such remarks are not worth taking seriously because they are a   of naivety, shortsightedness,   prejudices, and unrealistic political fantasies. Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous. ”As many have observed, it would set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the US. After all, how can the US deny China access to its own territories without inviting the latter’s legitimate, defensive responses?” A piece in The Global Times, meanwhile, said that ”unless Washington plans to wage a   war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish. . .. Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories.” The Global Times is ”known for its hawkish and   editorials,” CNN notes, ”but analysts say it doesn’t necessarily reflect Chinese policy.”",-0.5
"How Draft Horses Are Helping Upgrade Cell Towers In Wisconsin. Companies that provide cell phone service are constantly racing to provide the most reliable signal. In Wisconsin, one of the providers has turned to a surprising option to get the job done: draft horses. The horses are helping U. S. Cellular upgrade equipment on about 200 cell towers in Wisconsin, some of which are served by    access roads. ”We call them roads. They’re more of a path,” says Brandi Vandenberg, the company’s regional planning manager for engineering. ”So when you don’t have a firm structure to travel on, any type of inclement weather can make it a challenge.” Wisconsin’s deep snow and heavy rains can make the access roads all but impassable for trucks. Vandenberg says with construction planned at so many tower sites, the company has a tight timetable for delivering equipment and scheduling technicians to install it. Jason Agathen, a driver for CH Coakley, the logistics company hired to coordinate the tower upgrades, knows how tricky the access roads can be. Agathen has delivered thousands of pounds of electronics gear to the cell tower sites. One trip, he says, involved snow so deep it blew the transmission on an ATV. So the company hired farmer Jason Julian of Medford, Wisc. and his draft horses to keep the tower upgrades on track. Julian uses draft horses to do much of the work on his organic dairy farm and for a horse logging business during the winter. His Belgian Brabant are the type of working horses that were common on Wisconsin farms before motor vehicles took over much of their work. ”They’re   heavily muscled. They’re easy keepers, very   very easy horses to be around. Very easy horses to train,” he says. Julian raises and trains the horses. For the last few months, he’s been loading two or three of them into a horse trailer a couple times each week, and hauling it with his pickup truck to remote cell phone towers. On a recent morning, he took along Hannah, a bay roan, and Billings, a blue roan. As he approaches the cell tower, he surveys the surrounding fields. ”Look at the end of the field. Do you see the water shining in the dead furrows in the end of the field? That tells you how muddy everything is. There’s just water sitting,” he says. Julian pulls over on the highway’s shoulder, followed by his wife, Katrina, who’s in a second pickup hauling a wooden wagon with a flat bottom and low sides. The two attach the horses to each other as Julian prepares to get to work. ”I’m getting ready to hook them to the wagon and get ready for the truck to arrive, so when the truck arrives we have a minimal, minimal amount of downtime time to deliver the freight,” Julian says. Soon after, the delivery truck drives up. Julian hops into the wagon and instructs his horses to back up to the truck. The workers transfer their cargo to the wagon, unloading a   boxes, each holding an   antenna. Julian then leads his team to the base of the cell tower. It’s only about 300 yards away, but out of reach for the big delivery truck, which would have become mired in the muck. ”This is a cakewalk for them,” Julian says. ”They’re used to being in the woods with me in   snow and mud, and have a 1, 500 pound log hooked behind them. So this is pretty easy stuff for them.” Julian says each load for the cell tower upgrades is usually about 2, 000 pounds. Although that’s heavier than a log, he says it’s not a challenge for the horses because most of the sites are on relatively flat terrain. Yet he says one recent delivery was tougher than the others. It was in a hilly area called West Salem. Julian says it took his team about 90 minutes to make the steep climb to the tower. ”It had constant switchbacks, super steep, just unbelievable terrain, and we made it,” he says. ”[W]e had to use a piece of firewood actually to block the [wagon’s] tires. About every 40 or 50 yards towards the top we’d block the tires and give the horses a breather.” One of the horses working that job was pregnant, and when she later gave birth, Julian named the foal Salem in recognition of the tough cell tower job. Agathen says he gets a kick out of the fact that horses have proven essential to the U. S. Cellular project. ”I’m from the city, so I don’t get to see a lot of horses to begin with. And seeing what he can do with them, it’s amazing to begin with. The control he has  —   and they’ve been using horses since the beginning of time from way back then to now. It’s pretty neat,” Agathen says. CH Coakley says it won’t hesitate to use horses again, the next time modern vehicles fail to get the job done.",-0.5
"Palestinian president plans to attend funeral of Israel’s Peres.  Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to pay a rare visit to Jerusalem on Friday to attend the funeral of former Israeli leader Shimon Peres, a Palestinian official said on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if the occasion would yield anything more than handshakes with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U. S. President Barack Obama, who will also be at the burial. Peres, who died on Wednesday aged 93, won a Nobel Prize for his peace efforts with the Palestinians in the 1990s. But with   negotiations frozen since 2014, it had been unclear whether Abbas would travel from nearby Ramallah in the occupied West Bank to Jerusalem. ”Abbas plans to go,” said the official, who asked not to be identified because no formal announcement had been made. The   Palestinian leader, who exercises limited   in the West Bank, last visited Jerusalem on Sept. 15, 2010, when he held talks with Netanyahu at the prime minister’s residence. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now the Democratic presidential candidate, attended that meeting. Abbas and Netanyahu, who last shook hands publicly at a U. N. climate conference in Paris on Nov. 15, 2015, have agreed in principle to hold a summit in Moscow at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But there have been no practical moves toward scheduling such a meeting, with both sides deeply divided over the issue of Jewish settlements on occupied land that Palestinians seek for an independent state. Outside Israel’s parliament on Thursday, thousands of Israelis filed past Peres’s   coffin, honoring the former president and prime minister, who died two weeks after a stroke. Former U. S. President Bill Clinton, arriving in Israel a day before the burial, visited the plaza in front of parliament to stand, head bowed, in front of Peres’s casket. The leaders of Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel, were not on the roster of participants issued by Israel’s Foreign Ministry. But the Egyptian foreign minister was scheduled to attend and King Abdullah of Jordan sent a telegram of condolences. Tens of thousands of people were expected to walk past Peres’s coffin as it lay in state in the parliamentary square on Thursday during a   public memorial. ”He was a man with a great dream to bring peace to this region, the new Middle East. Sadly, we have not reached that goal yet but we still carry on with his aims,” said Michael Leon, a   bank worker. Britain’s Prince Charles and French President Francois Hollande were among a long list of foreign dignitaries set to attend Peres’s funeral, which will take place in the ”Great Leaders of the Nation” section of Jerusalem’s Mount Herzl cemetery.   (Additional reporting by Ali Sawafta and Nidal  ; editing by Ralph Boulton) UNITED NATIONS The United States cautioned on Wednesday it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea’s nuclear missile program but said it preferred global diplomatic action against Pyongyang for defying world powers by test launching a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska.

"Couple indicted in Texas Denny’s chokehold death. Houston (CNN) A Texas deputy and her husband could face life in prison after a night out for two Texas families turned into a deadly fight.  John Hernandez kicked and gasped for air when a deputy’s husband allegedly had him in a chokehold outside a   Denny’s restaurant, a video shows. Minutes later, the    father was rushed to the hospital and three days later, he was taken off life support. How the attack unfolded is at the center of the criminal case against Terry Thompson and his wife, Harris County Sheriff’s deputy Chauna Thompson.  Thompson’s attorney said Terry was acting in   and that a video that was released does not tell the full story of how the altercation unfolded. The couple was indicted on murder charges after Hernandez’s death was ruled a homicide by the Harris County medical examiner’s office, reported CNN affiliate KTRK.  They were in custody late Thursday night and released on bond early Friday, according to the Harris County Sheriff’s office. What happened? It was just after 11 p. m. on May 28 when Terry Thompson verbally confronted Hernandez for urinating outside a Denny’s restaurant in Northeast Harris County, the sheriff’s office said. ”A physical altercation ensued,” the sheriff’s office said. ”After being confronted with urinating in public, he rushed to my client and struck him in the face. Now, I would consider that an attack,” said Thompson’s attorney, Scot Courtney.   As Thompson, 41, brought Hernandez to the ground, a man walked outside the restaurant and started recording the incident.  A   video shows Thompson on top of Hernandez locking him in a chokehold while his wife, who was off duty, pins Hernandez’s left arm to the ground.   As Hernandez kicks and gasps for air, Thompson tells Hernandez, ”Do you want me to hit you again? Do you want me to hit you again?” Then two unknown people try to block the bystander from recording more of the scene. At one point a woman screams, ”It’s illegal to record.”  Several seconds later the recording stops. Under Texas law, individuals are allowed to videotape others without their permission in public spaces with the exception of dressing rooms and bathrooms, but only if it’s not for sexual purposes.   Hernandez’s wife, Maria Toral, and her daughter were inside the restaurant when the incident began and rushed outside, yelling at the Thompsons to release Hernandez. ”The little daughter was screaming, ’Quit hitting my daddy,’” their attorney, Randall Kallinen, said. Courtney claims Thompson was acting in  . ”My client was trying to subdue him,” Courtney said. ”That’s all he was doing.”  When Hernandez stopped resisting, the Thompsons ”noticed that he was not breathing,” a statement from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said. Before he was taken to the hospital, the statement says, Chauna Thompson performed CPR on Hernandez. The autopsy report said Hernandez’s death was a homicide and that he died from anoxic encephalopathy caused by strangulation by chest compression, reported CNN affiliate KPRC. ’We are not done’ For Hernandez’s aunt, Wendy Maldonado, the indictment is just a first step toward justice, she said. ”We are not asking for the death penalty for the Thompson family. We are only asking for life in prison,” Maldonado told reporters. Family and friends will be holding a wake Friday to honor Hernandez. He will be buried Saturday after a mass and graveside service, according to a Houston area funeral home. Randall Kallinen, an attorney for the Hernandez family, told a crowd of supporters Thursday night they need to remain vigilant. ”We are not done, though, because no one has been convicted of anything,” he said. Kallinen told CNN affiliate KTRK that the family was pleased with the district attorney’s office, which he praised as swift and thorough. ’It does raise questions for us’ The case has sparked outrage and allegations that Thompson received preferential treatment from his wife’s law enforcement colleagues. Kallinen said Hernandez’s wife was put in a police squad car for nearly four hours and had her cell phone taken away by deputies at the scene. The night of the altercation, deputies considered filing assault charges against Hernandez because the case had been reported as an assault, not a homicide, said Tom Berg, first assistant district attorney for Harris County. Officers at the scene did not tell prosecutors Hernandez was unconscious and being rushed to a hospital for treatment, according to the district attorney’s office.  Prosecutors say homicide investigators were not called to the scene because Hernandez didn’t die of his injuries until several days later. The prosecutor said homicide investigators are better trained to question witnesses and collect evidence from crime scenes.  ”It does raise questions for us,” Berg said. ”We are concerned that things happened later than they should have, but we have a complete picture now.” ”We will show no favoritism. We will let the chips fall as they may with the grand jury,” Berg added. On Wednesday, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the agency has asked the Department of Justice and Texas Rangers to review the investigation.  ”From the beginning we have promised a fair, thorough and transparent investigation,” Gonzalez told reporters.   He said Chauna Thompson has been removed from her patrol duties and moved to an administrative job within the department until the investigation concludes. Hernandez’s family and friends gathered Wednesday in a march and rally to demand justice and urge the arrests of the Thompsons. ”This should not have happened, and the fact that it did happen shows that there are things that need to be fixed within the sheriff’s department,” Oscar Hernandez told CNN affiliate KTRK. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the first name of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Chauna Thompson.",-1.0
"French president: Trump gives ’retching feeling’.  (CNN) French President François Hollande said Tuesday that Donald Trump’s ”excesses” give those watching a ”retching feeling,” adding his voice to the onslaught of criticism directed at the Republican candidate.  ”His excesses end up giving a retching feeling, even in the US, especially when    as was Donald Trump’s case    he speaks ill of a soldier, of the memory of a soldier,” Hollande told reporters in Paris.  In a stark rebuke, he denounced Trump’s comments on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Muslim parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, as ”offensive and humiliating.” RELATED: Donald Trump’s strange campaign gets stranger, Hollande’s comments follow President Barack Obama’s declaration Tuesday that Trump ”is unfit to serve as president.” Obama also criticized Trump’s treatment of the Gold Star family, adding that his ”basic knowledge of critical issues in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia, means that he’s woefully unprepared to do this job.” Holland noted the international importance of the election, stating that if Trump wins, ”there will be consequences because the American election is a global election.” ”Democracy is also a major issue considering the authoritarian temptation that we see arising,” Hollande said, adding that ”that includes” the U. S.  Last week the French president angrily countered Trump’s statement following terror attacks in Nice and Normandy said that ”France is no longer France.” ”France will always be France,” Hollande retorted, according to The New York Times.

"How the travel ban ruling could change public education | TheHill. Liberal politicos celebrating court decisions voiding President Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s travel orders seem not to have noticed something: Those decisions pose a direct threat to the state constitutional language they rely on to block school choice programs. This danger is not merely theoretical: The state constitutional language they rely on will come under Supreme Court scrutiny later this year. The state constitutional provisions at risk are called “Blaine clauses”—or, less accurately, “Blaine amendments.” They ban state aid to schools and other institutions deemed “sectarian” or “denominational.” Liberal lawyers, judges, and pressure groups have long argued Blaine clauses ban school choice programs that include religious schools.   But if Trump’s travel orders violate the U.S. Constitution, then Blaine clauses probably do as well. Indeed, the case against the Blaine clauses is stronger in some ways than the case against the travel orders. Blaine clauses are named for the prominent 19th century federal politician James G. Blaine. During Blaine’s political career, many Americans disliked new Catholic immigrants and their religion. Many states forced immigrant children into public schools imbued with Protestant theology. The idea was to wedge them into a nondenominational Protestant mold. Catholics naturally asked for public assistance in funding their own schools. Blaine, whose mother was Catholic, seems not to have been prejudiced himself. However, his ambition led him to cater to prejudiced voters. In 1875, while serving as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, he proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to permanently block “sectarian” (i.e., Catholic) institutions from enjoying equal treatment. Blaine’s amendment failed to pass, but Protestant majorities wrote similar clauses into most state constitutions. The word “sectarian” was carefully chosen. Some modern lawyers and courts think it meant merely “religious,” but they are mistaken. After all, the public schools receiving state aid were religious (Protestant). The dictionaries of the time show that “sectarian” carried negative meanings of dissent, bigotry, and heresy. These were terms by which many Protestants described Catholics. In his new study, Blaine’s Shadow, Ross Izard, an educational analyst at Denver’s Independence Institute, shows the direct connection between the Colorado Constitution’s Blaine clause and religious and ethnic prejudice. He points out, for example, that Colorado’s Catholic population consisted largely of Mexican-Americans, a demographic that was unpopular at the time. He quotes from anti-Catholic newspaper editorials, and he observes that the state constitutional convention itself met in the lodge of a secret society that refused to admit Catholics. Is this sort of evidence useful for determining whether a rule violates the First Amendment? The court decisions voiding Trump’s travel orders hold that it is. Those rulings rely on allegedly-anti-Muslim statements issued around the same time the orders were issued. The evidence of anti-Catholic bias surrounding Blaine provisions is far more extensive and unequivocal. Moreover, courts traditionally don’t defer to alleged state violations of the First Amendment nearly as much as they defer to federal foreign affairs and immigration policies. Liberal defenders of the Blaine clauses sometimes note that evidence of anti-Catholic bias does not exist in all the states that adopted them. This is true. For example, although Montana’s Blaine clause originated in that state’s 1889 constitution, its current version dates only to 1972—when anti-Catholic bias was presumably less. But Blaine clauses can be used as weapons to attack any unpopular religious denomination. All state courts need do is brand a disfavored denomination as “sectarian” and—presto!—the state constitution thrusts them into a position of inequality. Even under proper modern usage, a nondenominational Protestant school is “non-sectarian,” while a Catholic, Mormon, or Orthodox Jewish denominational school is “sectarian.” The First Amendment’s Establishment Clause does not permit government to play favorites in that manner. It does not permit the government to make judgments about which religions are acceptably “nondenominational” (good!) and which are “sectarian” (bad!). Suppose a state constitution contained a clause that read, “Freedom of speech is guaranteed, except for any speech judges find to be contrary to the public good.” Would such a clause survive review under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution? No, it would not. By the same reasoning, neither should Blaine clauses. Rob Natelson is a retired constitutional law professor and constitutional historian.

"German business morale unexpectedly falls in April. German business morale unexpectedly fell in April as companies were more downbeat about the current situation, but managers' expectations slightly improved, a survey showed on Monday. The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Monday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, inched down to 106.6 in April from 106.7 in March. The reading compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise to 107.0. The drop was driven by deteriorated sentiment in the wholesaling and retailing sectors, while business climate in manufacturing and construction improved.

"The Humor In ’Crosstalk’ Gets Lost In The Hubbub. I love Connie Willis’ writing. To Say Nothing of the Dog is one of my favorite books, a comfort read to which I often return sharp, confident, deliciously funny, it seamlessly wove a comedy of manners into a science fictional premise that’s delighted me for years. If I were asked to describe hallmarks of Willis’ work, I’d name her pacing, character work, ear for dialogue and wonderful sense of humor. Crosstalk, unfortunately, is not a great showcase for any of those things. Briddey Flannigan is an executive at a communications company called Commspan, in stiff competition with Apple to produce the most revolutionary new smartphone, one that will make people more connected than ever before. Briddey herself feels a bit too connected to people  —   beset by nosy, overbearing   and nosy, overbearing family members who text and call and show up unannounced at her work, it’s all she can do to keep her   to her boss, Trent Worth, secret. After six weeks of dating, Trent’s proposed to her  —   but wants them to get special brain surgery together before they tie the knot. Called an EED, it’s an outpatient procedure that’s meant to make romantic partners feel each other’s emotions. Briddey’s keen to do it, in spite of the protests of her family and taciturn coworker, C. B. Schwartz  —   but things go wrong, shenanigans ensue, antics abound. My disappointment with this book is in large part a sort of helpless bafflement. It has so many elements I’d have expected to love. I’m absolutely here for meditations on our   society, on how social media has shifted the meaning and performance of privacy, on how an increase in the quantity of connections sometimes means a diminishment of their quality. I’m also very happy to read romantic comedies  —   a genre built on foregrounding women’s desires and agency  —   that focus on whole families. But Crosstalk isn’t interested in nuanced exploration of any of these topics  —   which would be fine, if it ever actually committed to being outright farce. In a farce, conversations don’t matter except as vehicles for miscommunication. Plots are mechanical humor relies on unlikely and inappropriate substitutions characters are caricatures. If Crosstalk were a farce, I might be able to excuse the exhaustingly irritating representations of Irishness, throwaway lines about Moroccan sheikhs and their wives, and pummelling overwhelm of incident. If I were seeing Crosstalk as a staged pantomime I might, possibly, forgive the fact that Briddey has no agency, that her personality and motivations consist entirely of making up excuses to avoid annoying conversations. But Crosstalk is trying to be something different, to have its   and eat it too, and the result is a   mess. Instead of plot mechanics, we get Briddey being lectured at by everyone from her Aunt Oona  —   who is American but affects a fake Irish accent for reasons that are insufficiently excused by plot  —   to her colleague C. B. whose relentless unwanted attention is insufficiently excused by good intentions. There’s no tidiness to these lectures  —   many of them are repetitive, speculative, meandering, especially in the latter acts, making the whole read like an early draft of a potentially better book. C. B. constantly brushes away Briddey’s questions with ”that’s not how it works”  —   a phrase I found myself repeating frequently whenever Twitter, Facebook, smartphones or genetics came up. Willis treats   social media as a speculative technology, which makes for some embarrassing dissonance: Normal people seem to use Facebook as a tool for mass surveillance instead of broadcasting the minutiae of their own lives, Twitter hashtags include punctuation, and in one of the more painfully contrived plot developments, someone exclaims ”You have to stop those tweets from getting out!” I don’t mean to be Neil deGrasse Tyson complaining about orbital mechanics here I’d forgive Crosstalk a great deal if it managed to be funny. But it’s not. I wanted so much to be made to laugh, to participate in the sparkle and wit of a Connie Willis book, but couldn’t. Instead I groaned and winced my way through in the hope that it would improve, but with the exception of a   turn that saw Briddey actually do something on her own initiative, it never did.   Crosstalk feels, ultimately, like someone’s   and unsuccessful attempt at writing a Connie Willis book. But if you do decide to read it and enjoy it, you can rejoice in knowing that literally everything else she’s written is much, much better.

"’Don’t Shoot Him. Don’t Shoot Him’.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Keith Lamont Scott’s wife can be heard pleading to officers not to shoot him and police are heard urging the    black man to “drop the gun” in new   footage of the moments leading up to the fatal shooting on Tuesday. The footage was captured by Rakeyia Scott, Scott’s wife, and shows the events before and immediately after his shooting by an officer from the   Police Department. The footage does not show the actual shooting and it neither contradicts nor bolsters the version of events offered by the police department. It was provided to NBC News, The New York Times, and other organizations by Scott’s attorneys.  At one point, Rakeyia Scott can be heard saying: “Don’t shoot him. Don’t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don’t shoot him. ” Later, officers can be heard shouting: “Drop the gun. ” When gunshots are eventually heard, Rakeyia Scott can be heard shouting: “Fuck. Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? He better not be fucking dead. He better not be fucking dead. I know that fucking much. I know that much. He better not be dead. I’m not going to come near you. I’m going to record, though. I’m not coming near you. I’m going to record, though. He better be alive because   …     I come. You better be alive. How about that? Yes, we here, over here at 50 . .. 50   …     9453 Lexington Court. These are the police officers that shot my husband, and he better live. He better live. Because he didn’t do nothing to them. ” The officers cannot be clearly heard after this. You can watch the video below, and though it does not show the actual shooting, it is disturbing. More from the Times: The lawyers said the cellphone video was shot by Rakeyia Scott, Mr. Scott’s wife on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Scott had parked his car in a visitor’s space in their apartment complex, where he often waited for one of his children to return home on a bus. The police were there to serve a warrant on someone else. The lawyers said Ms. Scott had come out of the apartment with a cellphone charger for her husband and noticed that police officers were around the truck. As we have previously reported, the circumstances surrounding Scott’s death are unclear —  with police and his family offering different versions of what happened. Police had been at the apartment building where the shooting occurred looking for a different man who had an outstanding warrant. They said Scott was walking from his truck holding a handgun, and did not put the weapon down despite multiple warnings, compelling Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also black, to shoot him. Vinson, in line with department policy, has been placed on paid leave. Scott’s family says he was reading a book when he was shot. Police say they recovered a handgun, but no book, from the scene of the killing. A photograph of that handgun was obtained by WCNC, the local NBC affiliate, soon after the shooting. But the   footage made public Friday does not appear to show anything resembling that object. Compare this photo from the newly released video (on right) to photo that came out earlier this week with circled object (on left) pic. twitter.  Meanwhile, Kerr Putney, Charlotte’s police chief, said Friday it was only a matter of time before the police   video of the shooting would be released. “It’s a matter of when and it’s a matter of sequence,” Putney said. He said the video would be released when the State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) “have all the pieces of the puzzle so that they can then give the fuller picture of exactly what happened. ” Putney previously said the footage, which Scott’s family viewed on Thursday, would not be made public while the investigation was ongoing. In Thursday’s news conference, the police chief said the footage did not offer “absolute definitive, visual evidence” that Scott pointed his weapon at officers, as they had claimed, but “when taken in the totality of all the other evidence, it supports what we’ve heard and the version of the truth that we gave about the circumstances that happened that led to the death of Mr. Scott. ” Scott’s death resulted in two consecutive nights of protests, though Thursday night was relatively peaceful. One person, identified as Justin Carr, 26, was killed, and Kerr said Friday that a man, Rayquan Borum, had been arrested in connection with that death.",-0.5
"Across the Street From the World Trade Center. To mark the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, readers and staffers are sharing their stories: where they were, what they remember, and how the events of that day changed their lives and their countries. On September 11, 2001, I was 7 years old, and my   teacher called a class meeting to explain that two airplanes had hit the twin towers in New York City, about 25 miles from where we were in northern New Jersey. I remember raising my hand and asking how there could be a plane crash on such a sunny day. The pilots just not seeing the towers, an honest mistake, was the only explanation I could fathom. I don’t think I knew what terrorism was then, but now I wonder if it’s something today’s American    know too well.   Many parents in my hometown of Ridgewood, including my dad, were among the thousands of people who commuted into New York each day. In 2001, my dad was working for Merrill Lynch in downtown Manhattan: His office stood opposite the World Trade Center. I am extremely lucky that, when my mom took me home from school that day, he was waiting there, unhurt.  Since he is very reserved by nature, it wasn’t until this week, 15 years later, that I finally got his account of what happened. A condensed transcript of that conversation follows. Emily Goldberg: How did you find out about the planes hitting the towers? Did you hear it or see it? Ken Goldberg: I was in at work well before anything happened. I remember noticing, before anything happened, that it was a really nice day. When it first was announced, people were talking about a small plane hitting one of the towers. So that was the initial story, which seemed strange at the time because it was a perfectly nice day. The first plane, I found out about it on our newswire about the markets. After that, no one really knew anything and no one was overly focused on it. Then, when the second one hit, people knew it was an attack. When the second plane hit, people were running towards my office to say that they either saw it or felt it. Then everyone started walking down the stairs. We were on the 19th floor. Emily: Was the building evacuated, or did people just realize at that point that they should get out? Ken: I don’t remember exactly what caused people to go, but I think the building staff had basically directed people to leave down the stairs. The elevators were shut off, and everyone walked out. It was very quiet. People didn’t know what was going on. When I got outside there were hundreds of people pouring out of my building. You saw a lot of smoke, and it seemed like it was really bad. It seemed like people were going to be in really bad shape up in the towers. We could see some people had broken windows, different things hanging out of building, and no one really knew what to do. People were just walking around, trying to find other people they worked with. Eventually it just got more and more crowded, and I decided to head for the ferry to Hoboken where I could get on the train because I figured it was a good time to get out of there. Emily: Did you call Mom at that point? Did everyone even have cell phones then? Ken: I had a cell phone. I think I called Mom before I left the office, when the first plane hit. I told her the story, but I said don’t worry. I think I called again when I was on the train, and told her the second one had been hit, and at this point it looked like terrorism. I lent my phone to someone on the train, and then I think it actually died after because I don’t remember using it after that. It was very quiet on the train, very strange. Everyone got on, and we were waiting for it to leave to go to Hoboken. It was like like a normal commute home, but they were waiting for trains to fill up before they left, and I just remember it was really quiet. I think shortly after we left the station people started hearing news that one of the towers had collapsed. We had gotten far enough away at that point, though, that it was surreal. Emily: Was there a general sense of panic? Were people concerned that you weren’t in the clear yet, that you could still be in danger? Ken: People were definitely worried, but it was very quiet. I think it was like being in shock. We didn’t know what was going on. We were able to get away from all the worst stuff though. There wasn’t anyone who was trapped in my building, everyone was able to get out. I think they ran a few more ferries after I left —  until the buildings fell and then clouds came over, and visibility was gone so they started sending rescue boats from New Jersey to pick up more people. Some people had to walk up Manhattan, or over the Brooklyn Bridge. Emily: Was your office building damaged at all? Ken: My building probably had some minor damage from when the towers fell, some broken windows, but for the most part it wasn’t damaged. I was at 250 Vesey Street and the towers were on the other side of the West Street, but it always seemed so close because they were so big. It  looked like it was right out your window. We used to go over there for lunch. I had meetings up in the towers, so I remember thinking about people that I knew who worked there when it happened. Luckily, anyone I had worked with closely there was able to get out, but you probably remember the families in Ridgewood. There were a few in your grade. .. Emily: Yeah, I remember. There were two kids in my grade whose fathers died that day. One boy was in my class. What was it like when you got back home to Ridgewood and got to the house? Ken: It all became more clear when I got home. I remember hearing fighter jets in the sky. It was like a war was starting or something. Mom and I were just watching the news reports over and over again, but I think hearing the fighter jets was really what hit me, because by then I felt kind of removed from it, I was back in the suburbs, but I could still hear them. It became clear that this thing was terrible, how many people may have been killed, and no one knew what had happened with people they knew who worked downtown, or what was going to happen with business. Emily: What happened in the weeks after? When did you go back to work, or even back into the city? Ken: The markets didn’t open for a couple days, and then we got moved around a bunch. We had space in the Bloomberg offices for a couple weeks, and then we relocated to Jersey City for a couple months before we got back. I did go down there just to see what it looked like in that first week, and there was this terrible smell of burnt metal once you came out of the subway. You couldn’t get near it, but I took the train as far as you could go and walked around a little, and you could see the giant pile of rubble. I couldn’t get into my building either, but I wanted to go down there and see it. It just seemed like, how could this happen? How could these buildings actually be down? Everyone seems have their own story of the   attacks, and I recently asked readers to share theirs to mark the 15th anniversary. I got responses from people who on that day were all over the world: in New York and nearby, in DC, elsewhere in the U. S. and in other countries. This first set of responses comes from people who were near the geographic epicenter of  ’s most devastating strike, on the World Trade Center. One reader had an office on the 14th floor of the World Trade Center, but he happened not to be in the office that day: Our firm had a telephone system which allowed people to call your office number and have it immediately connected to any number you desired. This allowed most of the staff to work remotely, whether from home or on the road. So, this particular day, none of the senior staff members were in the office, whether at home or traveling. September 11 was the first day of school for some schools in the area. Our office manager was taking her daughter to school that morning, so she was not in the office that morning either. While we suffered no casualties in the attack on the WTC, I have friends who died in the attack. My older daughter was away at college, and my younger daughter was a senior in high school. When the news reports started circulating, the high school administration determined which students had parents who worked at the WTC, gathered them together, and gave them the news. My daughter had seen me at home when she left for school, so she was pretty confident that I was okay. However, my older daughter didn’t know, and she was desperately trying to get in contact with me. The cell phone system was overwhelmed with the demand, and she was unable to get through for hours. But she ultimately did, much to her relief. Since there was still a fear that there might be further attacks, she said that she wanted to come home from school so she could die with us. We were scheduled to take my younger daughter on some college visits at the end of the week. It was a great relief for all of us to get out of the New York area. It was difficult for me to talk with anyone about what happened, both because it could have been much different for me, and also because of the friends I lost. It’s gotten easier over the years, although I can still become emotional about it, whether talking about it or writing this  . Another reader, Kate Achille, recalls chaos in her high school in suburban New Jersey, in a “commuter town” where many of the residents worked in the city. “As a family, we were lucky,” she writes. “Many in our area were not. I can still remember passing by   parking lots full of cars whose drivers weren’t coming back. ” Kids were desperately trying to reach their parents. The phone lines were jammed. The school kept telling us to stay inside and keep calm. I couldn’t get through to either parent. At this point I made the decision to go home as quickly as I could, walking next door to pull my sister from the middle school. The school administrators had tried to set up a barricade to keep us on the school grounds. A neighbor came to take us home. After it rained that night, a friend of mine told me her family of first responders were in need of socks and supplies. We spent the next week collecting anything and everything we could from all over the country. Socks, head lamps, respirators, flashlights. I visited the city a few days later but didn’t dare to go downtown. I saw the posters of the missing, breathed the dust still lingering in the air. Even 15 years later I can remember every minute of that week. Fully aware of what was happening in the world, my childhood privilege was gone and everything became much more apparent. Even now, it feels that to some extent the attacks created a dividing line in my brain of before and after, as if the whole structure of my world changed that day. A reader in Kansas City relays his Uncle Todd’s experience of sitting at on a plane at New York’s La Guardia airport, waiting to take off on the morning of September 11th. Todd, he writes, passed away last year. The reader’s own memories of the day include: 1. Watching the Today Show live when the second plane hit. (Watching from our home here in Kansas City) 2. Driving to work and seeing an airplane’s   . (All the planes were being forced to land ASAP.) 3. After the second building fell, calling my Mom (in Lincoln, NE). I started crying when I heard her voice. But she knew why I was calling, and said, “Toddy’s OK. We heard from him. ” (My Uncle Todd had lived in NYC for over 50 years.) 4. Later, hearing Uncle Todd’s story: He was in a plane on a LaGuardia tarmac. The pilot came over the PA and said something like: “Uh, we’re all being told to move back to the gate. Apparently there was an incident   …     uh   …     (pause)   …     Whoa!” Todd had to walk all the way from LaGuardia to the Upper West Side. Finally, the recollections of Agnieszka   a reader who grew up in Jersey City, right across the East River from where the towers once stood. “I still see the Towers in my mind’s eye when I look at lower Manhattan,” she writes. “They used to be my guide whenever I was lost in New York and needed to orient myself. ” On that day, Agnieszka was on the Rutgers University campus, but her mother was in Manhattan: My mom ran to work from Christopher Street, and opened the restaurant where she worked. Soon, groups of people in shock came from way downtown. The restaurant gave away free alcohol to everyone. The rest of the day was shock clear, silent skies and trying to donate blood for what we assumed would be many survivors. The Turnpike was closed, as was NJ Transit. People couldn’t get home. My mom waited hours to get on a ferry back to Jersey, and then walked from Weehawken to downtown Jersey City. A professor stayed in my studio, she couldn’t get home to her husband in Manhattan. We sat in an Indian restaurant, and then in a Dunkin Donuts in Highland Park for hours, with several friends of mine, too stunned to talk. I couldn’t get to my parents until Wednesday, the day after. We went to the waterfront at Exchange Place, a walk of maybe 10 minutes. The ruins were still burning, and the smell hit us from across the river. I wrote this email to my goddaughter, who grew up in California, on August 28, 2006. She was 10 years old at the time, and she had asked me where I was on September 11, 2001.  So on Sept. 11 I woke up early so I could go vote that morning. I did not turn the TV on since I wanted to get out of the house soon. I walked to the polling station (where you vote) and voted. Then I took the train to work, as I always did. [I lived then on West 176th Street  in Washington Heights, one of the northernmost neighborhoods of Manhattan —  I had grown up in the Bronx. I worked at Urban Latino magazine, down on Varick Street in the West Village, about 30 blocks from the World Trade Center. That meant I had to traverse the length of the island daily.] When I got about halfway down on my way, we stopped at one of the stations along 42nd Street, which is the center of the city. The conductor announced that the train was being held in the station because a small airplane had crashed onto the antenna of the World Trade Center. All the passengers in the car started grumbling since we were all going to be late for work. So I decided to get out onto the street and take a taxi the rest of the way. When I got up on the surface there were a lot of people walking in every direction and many of them huddled in groups talking about something major that had just happened. Then I saw some people, especially women, running up the street away from downtown. So I got nervous and checked how much money I had in my wallet. Exactly $2! Not enough to get me to work or home. So I started walking toward the bank, which was closer to the center of Times Square. As I got closer to Times Square there were many more people in the area —  thousands —  and traffic had stopped. Everyone was looking up at the giant television monitors on the sides of the buildings in Times Square. CNN was on and they were showing video of a plane hitting one of the towers. I was stunned. It was so surreal and unbelievable. And it was happening about 50 blocks away from where I was standing. People were really quiet around me. Just watching the footage of the attack and reading the closed captioning as it described what happened. Then I realized that I was standing in the center of the city, and that if we were under attack, they might attack Times Square since it’s the heart of NYC. So then I walked really fast to the bank and took $40 out to take a taxi home. I realized it was too dangerous to try and go to work since I worked close to where the towers where. I walked all the way west, away from Times Square and towards the river because I thought if they attacked the area I could jump in the water and swim across to New Jersey! Anyway, I soon realized that no taxis were stopping to pick up passengers since everyone just wanted to go home. So I thought I’d have to walk all the way home, almost 150 blocks. Then a bus stopped —  it was packed with people —  and I went toward the back door. Two guys opened the door and pulled me straight into the bus. I was crammed in by the door but at least we were moving faster than if I were walking. As the bus headed north, away from the center of the city, I saw thousands and thousands of people walking in every direction. The bus did not go all the way to my neighborhood so I ended up taking a taxi for about 30 blocks. Instead of going straight home, I went to the hospital where my uncle works since I did not want to be alone (also, my cell phone did not work so I wanted to go to his office and use his phone and computer to let everyone know that I was okay). I spent most of the afternoon at his office, emailing my friends and family and reading the news online. Then I went home and watched the coverage until very late that night. It was a very sad day. I hope you never have to experience anything like that. I was nowhere near New York or D. C. on September 11, 2001. I was a senior in high school in suburban St. Louis, and when I woke up that morning I knew the date was significant —  not because of what would happen on the East Coast within the next few hours, but because I’d started dating my   sweetheart exactly a year before, and “ ” was a handy way to remember the anniversary. That day changed the course of life —  and in 2, 977 cases, ended it —  for many people, whether they were   students in St. Louis, or   in Manhattan, or generals in the Pentagon, or farmers in Afghanistan. For some of us with the luxury of a far remove, the significance wasn’t immediately clear. I remember fiddling with the radio in my Volvo on the way to school, hearing something about “top floors are on fire,” and switching to the oldies station. By the time I got to my first class, U. S. history, the television was on in the classroom and Ms. Fairbank was gesticulating with the remote. I assumed, watching smoke pour out of the buildings, that everyone must have gotten out it just didn’t seem possible so many people could die, all at once, in America. I didn’t really get that something truly enormous and horrible had happened until my mother called me, on the classroom phone as I sat in physics right before lunch, to say everything was going to be all right and she and dad loved me, and it would be wise to get gas on the way home. Everyone I’ve talked to about it over the past 15 years seems to remember where they were that day. There were those who lost loved ones, and those for whom the attacks determined the future in other ways: They joined the military, got into politics, or ditched stable jobs to go document the “war on terror. ” And these were just the Americans Afghans I met in Kabul 10 years after the attacks had seen their lives completely transformed, for good and ill. There were little girls marching to school on dusty mornings as they hadn’t been allowed to under the Taliban. There were new job opportunities and a flood of foreign aid. There were also suicide bombings, humiliating night raids into Afghan homes by American   forces, spiraling corruption, and thousands of civilians killed, predominantly by the Taliban but also by coalition forces and those loyal to the government. How did September 11 change your life, or your country, wherever in the world you are? What are your memories of that day and the aftermath? How are you marking the anniversary, and how has your perspective on the events of that day changed over the past 15 years? Write to us at hello@theatlantic. com to share your own experience.

"The Fourth Circuit Distorts the Law to Defeat Trump’s Travel Ban. A strange madness is gripping the federal judiciary. It is in the process of crafting a new standard of judicial review, one that does violence to existing precedent, good sense, and even national security for the sake of defeating Donald Trump. We’ll call this new jurisprudence “Trumplaw,” and its latest victim is once again the   Trump travel ban. The perpetrator is the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. 	This afternoon, the Fourth Circuit upheld a nationwide injunction on Trump’s temporary halt on immigration from six   countries  —   each of which is either a state sponsor of terrorism (Sudan and Iran) or overrun with terrorist violence, with entire regions under jihadist control (Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Somalia). Indeed, some of these countries no longer have a recognizably functional government. 	Since Trumplaw is such a novel form of jurisprudence, it’s exceedingly hard to square with existing precedent. So, when existing precedent either doesn’t apply or cuts against the overriding demand to stop Trump, then it’s up to the court to yank that law out of context, misinterpret it, and then functionally rewrite it to reach the “right” result. 	Take, for example, the Fourth Circuit’s reading of a Supreme Court case called Kleindienst v. Mandel. In Mandel, a collection of scholars demanded that the U. S. grant a   visa to Belgian Marxist journalist. The government had denied him entry under provisions of American law excluding those who advocated or published “the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism. ” Make no mistake, the First Amendment protects the right to advocate or publish Marxist doctrines every bit as much as it protects the free exercise of the Islamic faith. Yet the Supreme Court still ruled against the Belgian journalist: 		We hold that, when the Executive exercises [its] power negatively on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek personal communication with the applicant. 	The meaning is clear. If the order is supported by legitimate and bona fide reasons on its face, you simply don’t go beyond the document. By that standard, the executive order is easily and clearly lawful. On its face, the order asserts a legitimate and bona fide   justification. On its face, the order isn’t remotely a Muslim ban. On its face it doesn’t target the Muslim faith in any way, shape, or form. On its face it describes exactly why each nation is included. The Fourth Circuit, however, interpreted Mandel to argue that the Court looked only at the face of the document to determine whether its supporting reasons were legitimate, not whether they were “bona fide. ” It could go “behind” the document to determine “good faith. ” 	Yet, as the dissent notes, this approach would have altered the outcome not only in Mandel itself, but also in other key Supreme Court cases. Indeed, in those cases the Court expressly declined to look behind notices and documents to explore the subjective motivations of relevant government officials. Judge Paul Niemeyer’s dissent is stinging, and correct: 		In looking behind the face of the government’s action for facts to show the alleged bad faith, rather than looking for bad faith on the face of the executive action itself, the majority grants itself the power to conduct an extratextual search for evidence suggesting bad faith, which is exactly what three Supreme Court opinions have prohibited. Mandel, Fiallo, and Din have for decades been entirely clear that courts are not free to look behind these sorts of exercises of executive discretion in search of circumstantial evidence of alleged bad faith. The majority, now for the first time, rejects these holdings in favor of its politically desired outcome. 	Thus, we are left with a majority holding that a document that unquestionably does not exclude Muslims from the United States is the means of, you guessed it, excluding Muslims from the United States. We are left with a majority holding that cements the idea that an otherwise lawful order is unlawful only because Donald Trump issued it. We are further left with a majority holding that a court may  —   in its sole discretion  —   determine when campaign statements (or any other political statements, really) can affect the constitutionality of a government action and trump even the text of the document itself. 	All this adds up to Trumplaw, the assertion by the federal judiciary of the legal authority to stop Trump. But don’t think Trumplaw will end when Trump himself leaves office. The principle is now established: When a judge doesn’t like a politician’s campaign statements, those statements can taint even actions that clearly contradict those statements. In other words, Trump can even change his mind  —   as he so plainly did  —   and not even his changed mind can be cleansed of its original sin. 	The sad reality is that this takes place in the aftermath of an event  —   the Manchester bombing  —   that demonstrates that one of the countries on the list, Libya, is in fact a hotbed of terrorist activity. The bomber traveled to Libya and allegedly had help there. He was a British citizen and not subject to the travel pause, but his journey illustrates the very real dangers of lawless regions gripped by jihad. Is it unconstitutional to pause entry from that nation to make sure that we can properly vet and screen for ISIS sympathizers? The Supreme Court has always said no. Today, the Fourth Circuit says yes. Today, the Fourth Circuit has chosen to distort the law and risk our national security to stop Donald Trump.,",1.0

"Trump’s Five Most Important Declarations At AIPAC Speech - Breitbart. TEL AVIV  —   Here are the five most important aspects of Donald Trump’s speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, on Monday. [1  —   Trump said he will “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ”  My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know   and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic  —   for America, for Israel, and for the whole Middle East. However, he stopped short of pledging to immediately nix the international nuclear accord signed in Vienna last year. He stated at AIPAC that “at the very least, we must hold Iran accountable by restructuring the terms of the previous deal. ” Channelling the sentiments of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Iran should suffer immediate consequences for likely violating U. N. Security Council resolution 2231 by conducting a series of ballistic missile tests in recent days. Netanyahu last week called for Western powers to take “immediate punitive steps” against Iran for the missile tests. Trump stated: The deal is silent on test missiles but those tests DO violate UN Security Council Resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. Which brings me to my next point  —   the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. 2  —   Trump declared he will check Iran’s growing regional dominance. The GOP frontrunner affirmed that as president he will “stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ” He outlined Iran’s support for terrorism worldwide, from Syria to the Gaza Strip to Lebanon and beyond. “They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home,” he said. “Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach. ” This policy of countering Iran’s regional influence stands in stark contrast to President Obama’s own coddling of Iran, and the president’s orientation away from America’s traditional Sunni Arab allies. 3  —   Trump said he opposes the United Nations unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state. An agreement imposed by the UN would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto. Why? Because that’s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come to the table and negotiate. Each side must give up something it values in exchange for something it requires. A deal that imposes conditions on Israel and the Palestinian Authority will do nothing to bring peace. It will only further delegitimize Israel and it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they are stabbing Israelis  —   and even Americans. He further threatened to veto “any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. ” 4  —   Trump vowed to move the U. S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem  —   and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel. 5  —   Trump will treat Israel like an ally and not a “  citizen. ” When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a   citizen will end on Day One. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we will be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. While this declaration may sound simplistic, it comes after seven years of Obama espousing policies some have argued are hostile to the Jewish state. And it comes on the heels of a turbulent relationship between Obama and Netanyahu, including a notorious May 2010 White House meeting in which Obama reportedly snubbed Netanyahu for dinner with Michelle and his daughters.  Also, the Obama administration faced accusations it encouraged the activism of nongovernmental organizations working to defeat Netanyahu in the 2015 elections in Israel.

"Geller: Turkish President Says No Muslim Family Should Engage in Birth Control - Breitbart. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the terrorist hatcheries to be operating at full capacity. He said Monday: “We will multiply our descendants. They talk about population planning, birth control. No Muslim family can have such an approach. Nobody can interfere in Allah’s work. The first duty here belongs to mothers. ” In the past, he has even said that using birth control was tantamount to treason.  The devout Muslim supremacist Turkish President, who styles himself the next Ottoman caliph, needs an army of vicious, mindless jihadis  —   why else would he issue this edict on birth control? The man who took down Turkey, who buried the founder of secular Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, and all that that he stood for hopes to resurrect the savage reign of the Ottoman empire. The Huffington Post ran a Reuters report on this without a hint of disapproval. They have no problem with this  —   but imagine what their reaction would have been if a Republican had said such a thing. The Express reported that “despite a decline, Turkey’s fertility rate is one of the highest in Europe and the population is just under 80 million. ” Europe is dying, from the combined effects of a low birth rate and suicidal immigration polices. What chance does it possibly have for a future? These comments from Erdogan about birth control don’t take place in a vacuum. The Turkish President has a vision for a Muslim Europe. He has devised a to bring it about and is putting that plan into very real action. Turkey was the gateway country for the unprecedented invasion of Muslims into Europe. Despite myriad attempts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Union to make deals with Turkey to somehow stem the tidal wave of Muslim migrants, Erdogan flagrantly moves ahead with his battle plan. And now EU Commission President   Juncker has accused Turkey of issuing “threats” to secure   travel in Europe for its 80 million citizens. Meanwhile, Erdogan exercises increasing power in Europe. Merkel is allowing a German comedian to be prosecuted for insulting the Turkish President. This is   sharia enforcement in Merkelistan. This woman is adopting Hitlerian policies. Hitler, too, restricted speech and enforced it much the way Merkel is, i. e.   Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to censor posts that were critical of the migrant invasion. That Zuckerberg did it shows how dangerous the power he wields really is. Merkel has gone off the rails. She has become a tool of the   caliph in Ankara. Freedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced. Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. That would be fine with Erdogan. The Jerusalem Post reported in April that Erdogan said: “I am one of the first political leaders officially declaring that   is a crime. I expect an official declaration that Islamophobia is a crime against humanity as well. Islamophobia emerged from the Western countries and this is a challenge that we all together need to surmount. ” What he means is that any opposition to jihad terror should be criminalized. This is the man whom Obama called his best, most trusted friend among world leaders. Europe dismantles while rebuilding the Ottoman Empire. Turkey’s demographics, especially with Erdogan’s new edict about birth control, make Turkey into a ticking time bomb that will go off in the heart of Europe before anyone expects  —   probably while European authorities are still wringing their hands over “Islamophobia. ” Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) publisher of PamelaGeller. com and author of The   Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

"London’s Muslim Mayor Backs Clinton For U.S. President. (Reuters)  —   London’s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, voiced support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday, warning that   views like those espoused by Republican Donald Trump “plays into the hands” of Islamic State. [During a stop in Chicago on his first visit to the United States, Khan said he was “a big fan” of Clinton and hoped she would win the presidential election in November.  “She’s arguably the most experienced candidate to run to be the president,” Khan told reporters following a speech to more than 250 academics, diplomats and business people. “As the father of two daughters, I think the message it sends when the most powerful politician in the world is a woman is phenomenal, and hope she wins,” said Khan, who as mayor of London is arguably one the most influential member of his faith in western Europe. Immediately after taking office in May, Khan tangled with Trump over his proposed ban on allowing Muslim immigrants and refugees into America, deriding his plan as “ignorant. ” During his roughly   speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Khan did not mention Trump by name but attacked the positions the New York developer has staked, such as tightening Muslim immigration into the United States. “I think to suggest somehow that Muslims aren’t welcome in the U. S. A. to suggest somehow that being a Muslim isn’t compatible with being western, unintentionally plays into the hands of daesh or   ISIS,” Khan said. Trump has offered an evolving stance on Muslim immigration into the United States since his original December 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the country. Earlier this summer, he voiced support for limiting the ban to only countries with known terrorist links. Last month, he appeared to moderate somewhat on an outright ban by touting the idea of the United States undertaking “extreme vetting” of incoming Muslim immigrants, refugees or visitors.",1.0
"Racial bias found in Texas death penalty cases, Harvard Law School study says. A Harvard Law School study has found that racial bias, overly aggressive prosecutions and inadequate representation for poor defendants affect death penalty cases in Harris County, Texas. Juries in the county, which includes Houston, have imposed the death penalty more than any other county in the US since its reinstatement in 1976. The Fair Punishment Project also notes that the number of death sentences handed down in Harris County has fallen to 10 since 2010, from 53 between 1998 and 2003.  Harris County was named one of 16 “outlier” counties in the US, where five or more death sentences were assessed in between 2010 and 2015. In the eight counties examined by the study, 41% of the death sentences were given to black defendants and 69% to minorities overall. In Harris County, all defendants condemned since 2004 were from racial minority groups. “When you look at what the death penalty actually looks like on the ground in Harris County, you see things that should disturb you,” Rob Smith, one of the researchers on the project, told the Houston Chronicle.  “There’s a pattern of overzealous prosecution that dates back for decades but is still present in the time period for the study, and is matched by   [defense] representation in cases. ” Harris County district attorney Devon Anderson said her office was judicious in its use of the death penalty. “When we seek death, it’s because we have a solid   case and a very strong punishment case,” she said. “The death penalty is only appropriate for the worst of the worst. ”  Anderson said she did not know the race of a defendant or victim whenever she and four top staff members met to discuss whether to seek the death penalty. “I think it’s very important that it be ‘blind’ in that regard,” she said. Juries across the country are proving to be increasingly reluctant to sentence defendants to death, the Harvard report said, choosing instead the option of life imprisonment without parole. The last Harris County trial in which prosecutors sought the death penalty ended in November:    Johnathan Sanchez was given life without parole. The last Harris County jury to assess a death sentence did so in 2014, when Harlem Lewis was sent to death row for the killings of Bellaire police officer Jimmie Norman and “good samaritan” Terry Taylor. The Harris County district attorney’s office is currently seeking the death penalty in two cases. Ronald Haskell, who is white, is accused of killing two adults and four children from his  ’s family in spring 2014. David Ray Conley, who is black, is accused of killing his   her husband and six children, including his son, last year.",-0.5
"Encrypted cloud storage and collaboration company Tresorit secures €11.5M Series B – TechCrunch. Tresorit, the Swiss-Hungarian company that provides end-to-end encrypted “file sync and sharing” for businesses, has closed €11.5 million in Series B financing. The round is led by European growth capital investor 3TS Capital Partners, alongside PortfoLion, a Central European venture capital. A number of existing investors also participated, such as Andreas Kemi, an early investor in LogMeIn and co-founder of Scala Business Solutions, and Márton Anka, founder of LogMeIn. I also understand the round included some secondary funding, meaning not all of the cash has entered Tresorit’s balance sheet. Operating in the enterprise cloud storage and collaboration market, Tresorit provides what it describes as zero-knowledge encryption technology and unique encryption key management. The high level pitch is that the company is able to offer on-premise equivalent security for businesses while offering the type of simple user experience we have come to expect in consumer apps. It serves more than 17,000 customers and says it has grown recurring revenue by an average of 3x every year in the last three years. Meanwhile, Tresorit will use the new Series B funding to further accelerate this growth by tapping into what it says is rising demand for secure cloud solutions, in light of a plethora of high profiles security breaches seen at major enterprises in recent years. This will include beefing up its management team with the aim of scaling up marketing and sales, and establishing new channel partners. “We are at an inflection point with our business as awareness regarding data protection and cybersecurity threats is getting stronger and demand is set to grow exponentially for our service in and outside of Europe,” says Tresorit founder and CEO Istvan Lam. He also says there is large market potential in channeling traditional IT expenditure into the cloud, citing a recent Deloitte survey indicating that traditional IT expenditure still accounts for two-thirds of all IT spending, while only one-third goes towards IT-as-a-service. “Many enterprises are holding back from migrating to the cloud due to security and privacy concerns. With security guaranteed by end-to-end encryption, more businesses can and will choose Tresorit’s cloud solution,” adds Lam. To that end, Tresorit recently launched a Beta version of “Tresorit Send,” a standalone file sharing product that offers a secure and encrypted alternative to unreliable file transfer sites and email attachments. The idea, presumably, is for the product to act as a shop window for the Tresorit user experience and the company’s broader end-to-end encryption offering.",0.0
"President Trump Calls for Immediate Investigation Into Chuck Schumer’s Ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin - Breitbart.

Senator Schumer’s meeting was a press conference, in full view of the press and public in 2003. Senator Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador and then went on to mislead Congress about those meetings, while being put in charge of an investigation into ties between Russia and the President’s campaign. That’s why he should resign, and why he had to recuse himself from the investigation.",1.0
"Mystery Surrounds West Coast Arrival of Zika-Spreading Mosquito - Breitbart. Meet the Aedes aegypti, a tiny   mosquito that is causing panic worldwide for its ability to transmit the Zika virus and a host of other diseases that have recently surfaced in the U. S.[The mosquito, on the decline since the 1980s in Southern Florida, suddenly surfaced in California under unknown circumstances in 2013. That year saw a major spike of illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America, where the Aedes aegypti has been spreading dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses that have become pandemic in those regions.  The Aedes aegypti, commonly referred to as the yellow fever mosquito, is recognizable by white markings on its legs and a lyre marking on the insect’s thorax. The mosquitoes primarily breed in   damp environments such as unused flowerpots, spare tires, untreated swimming pools, and drainage ditches. The virus originated in Africa and has been documented off and on in the U. S. for centuries, although the mosquito’s most recent domestic history is fraught with question marks. The mosquito has been “incriminated as the likely primary vector in historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s,” according to academic research. It has been detected in Florida and some southern states. The climate of South Florida makes the region a good breeding ground and the insect was previously a common   vector in the state until the arrival of a rival mosquito, the Asian tiger mosquito, or Aedes albopictus, in 1985. The Epidemiology and Nematology Department at the University of Florida documents: Since the introduction of the Asian tiger mosquito in 1985, by way of Texas, the population of Ae. aegypti in Florida has declined dramatically, but still thrives in urban areas of South Florida. The insect was first detected in significance in California in 2013. Before 2011, the Aedes aegypti was “rarely detected in California and were not known to persist,” related an article from the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The journal documented the mosquito’s arrival on the West Coast: In 2013, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were detected in Fresno, Madera, and San Mateo Counties, California analysis indicated they were genetically most similar to Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from the southeastern United States. In 2014, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes persisted in those 3 counties and were also detected in Kern, Tulare, Los Angeles, and San Diego Counties. In 2015, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were detected in Imperial, Orange, and Alameda Counties. In September 2015, the insect was also detected for the first time in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. In 2014, the insects were found in offices at San Diego’s 32nd Street Naval Station, the Los Angeles Times reported. The same kind of mosquitoes were found on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8, 2014 in the Los   counties of Commerce and Pico Rivera. The species has since been detected in Tulare, Kern, Imperial, Orange, and Alameda counties. Another transmitter of similar diseases, the mosquito Aedes albopictus, was detected in Kern and San Diego counties as well as regions of Los Angeles County. Experts have said the Aedes aegypti mosquito arrived on the West Coast through cargo in ships and airplanes although the exact mode of transportation has not been documented. Zika spreading ‘explosively’ The mosquito has been spreading the Zika virus, which epidemiologists believe is causing an unprecedented outbreak of infants born with small heads in Brazil. The disease is also associated with developmental delays, seizures, and intellectual disabilities in newborns. Last month, after 2, 400 babies were born in the country with microcephaly, a neurological disorder, Brazilian health officials took the unusual step of warning women not to get pregnant. Besides the possibility of causing birth defects, according to the CDC, the most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache. The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) for Zika virus disease is not known, but is likely to be a few days to a week. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The symptoms are so close to the flu it may be difficult at first to detect. The World Health Organization is set to convene an emergency committee in Geneva on Monday to coordinate a global response to the outbreak, with the agency’s head, WHO   Margaret Chan, warning the disease is spreading “explosively. ” The Wall Street Journal viewed the WHO’s announcement as underscoring “the speed with which a virus that began as an obscure tropical malady afflicting Africa and then several remote Western Pacific islands has transformed into a major international health concern, particularly in the Americas. ” Arrival of dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, Besides Zika, the Aedes aegypti also transmits dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Breitbart reported Mexico has been experiencing an alarming rise of chikungunya, a painful and sometimes debilitating infection that could potentially spread across the porous border. And there is already evidence of at least one case arriving from Mexico, as Breitbart documented last month. In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added Mexico to the “Watch Level 1” category for chikungunya. In late November, the CDC updated their “Level 1” warning, advising travelers to Mexico to “protect themselves from chikungunya by preventing mosquito bites. ” Local chikungunya transmission began in Mexico in October 2014, with 155 cases confirmed before the end of the year. The numbers skyrocketed in 2015, with 9, 952 cases reported in Mexico as of November 8. According to CDC data, the U. S. in 2015 has seen 571 chikungunya cases in 42 states as of November 17, with all reported cases coming from “travelers returning from affected areas. ” The news media has spotlighted chikungunya in recent weeks after a new study found the disease can cause severe and potentially fatal brain infection, especially in infants and seniors. The report, published in the journal Neurology, examined a   chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. Scientists found that the rate of encephalitis among those infected with the chikungunya virus outpaced the rate for all encephalitis reported in the U. S. from 1998 to 2010. The most common symptoms of chikungunya are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Migrants, chikungunya and Texas, Missing from the discussion is the potential for illegal aliens to bring in Chikungunya from Mexico. One area to watch is clearly the   border, where dengue is already endemic. Indeed, there is at least one case of transmission from Mexico to Texas. On August 11, 2015, the city of Garland issued the following press release: On August 11, 2015 the Garland Health Department (GHD) confirmed the first case of imported Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Garland in 2015. The individual was infected with the virus during recent travel to Mexico and is no longer contagious. And Breitbart unearthed a June 2014 dispatch from the Public Health and Environmental Services for Harris County, the most populous county in Texas. The pamphlet on Chikungunya stated, “Global travel, urbanization, immigration, climate, and presence of the mosquito species known to transmit these diseases in Harris County are all factors that contribute to the possibility of these diseases emerging in our area. ” On July 7, 2014, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed the first human case of the disease, reportedly an individual who had traveled to the Caribbean. Two days later, a second case was confirmed, this time in an    woman who had returned from a trip to Haiti. By July 23, 2014, a “handful of Texas residents” were identified as being infected with the chikungunya in five Texas counties. The next month, Texas was home to at least 14 cases. Nationwide that month, cases in New Jersey more than doubled to 25 New York confirmed 44 cases, and Florida saw a marked increase. These cases came before the Mexico Chikungunya outbreak reached a “Level 1” CDC threat. The World Health Organization documented a previous case in which infected migrants introduced chikungunya in 2007 in a coastal village in Italy, sparking an outbreak of 197 cases. In June 2012, Scientific American discussed the disease, as well as other illnesses such as Chagas and dengue fever in the context of possible transmission via illegal aliens crossing the border. “Since undocumented immigrants are difficult to track, officials have a hard time measuring and treating infected individuals,” the magazine reported.

"Oil rallies hard, but this is not the bottom. Oil surged above $30 a barrel temporarily in the biggest relief rally in three months, but crude has still not found a floor and U.S. economic data and earnings season could play a big role in driving prices in the near term. Oil and other risk assets were boosted Thursday by dovish comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who said it would be necessary to review the central bank's monetary policy stance in March. That sparked expectations of more quantitative easing from the ECB. Crude settled up 4.2 percent Thursday at $29.53 per barrel after rising more than 6 percent earlier in the session. Traders also found a silver lining in an otherwise bearish U.S. government inventory report which showed a build in oil supplies and another big 4 million barrel build in gasoline supplies. Encouraging to bulls, however, was the increase in distillate demand and drawdown of 1 million barrels in distillates, or diesel and heating oil. ""Our view is that prices should average in this range for the quarter,"" said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays. ""We don't see levels below this as being sustained. This is in line with our forecast. We also think the market is prone to these types of moves, given the positioning.""",0.0
"Artist Peter Doig victorious as court agrees ’$10m’ painting is not his work. A    landscape painting once valued at $10m and signed “Pete Doige” was not made by the artist Peter Doig, a Chicago federal court ruled on Tuesday. Doig had been sued by a former Canadian corrections officer who claimed the artist was falsely denying that he had made the work. The unusual authentication lawsuit was filed in 2013 after the Scottish artist refused to authenticate the painting when the former corrections officer, Robert Fletcher, and art dealer Peter Bartlow tried to sell it. It required Doig to prove he hadn’t painted the work. “I feel a living artist should be the one who gets to say yea or nay and not be taken to task and forced to go back 40 years in time. It was painstaking to piece this together,” he said during the ruling, according to the New York Times. Fletcher claimed he and Doig had met at Lakehead University in the 1970s. In 1976, he said he bought the work for $100 from the artist while he was incarcerated at the Thunder Bay Correctional Centre, where Fletcher worked. He said he watched Doig paint the desert landscape, fell in love with it, and purchased it to stop the young man, who had been incarcerated on an LSD charge, from going back to selling drugs. Years later, a friend noticed the painting and suggested that it could have been created by Doig, according to Fletcher’s lawsuit. From there, Fletcher began working with Bartlow, who owns an art gallery in Chicago and is now a   in the case. In the trial, Fletcher and Bartlow attempted to show similarities between the painting and Doig’s other works as evidence. They also claimed his denial was the product of embarrassment over the incarceration or past drug use. Doig, however, said he had never attended the university and had never been incarcerated, citing his school yearbook, his mother’s letters about his whereabouts  —   including his role in Romeo and Juliet in high school  —   and written testimony from friends as evidence, the New York Times reported. He wrote in court papers that he hadn’t begun to paint on canvas until late 1979. “If I had painted that painting when I was 16, I would admit it,” he wrote. Born in Edinburgh in 1959, Doig lived in Trinidad with his family before moving with them to Canada in 1966. He studied art in London on and off between 1979 and 1990. His magical landscape paintings have earned millions  —   last year, Swamped, a painting of a moonlit white canoe, sold at action for nearly $26m. Fletcher and Bartlow sought $5m in damages and a declaration that the painting was authentic, since its sale was likely to earn them millions, based on recent sales of Doig’s work. The artist’s lawyers said they identified the real Pete Doige, whose records matched Fletcher’s description. Doige died in 2012, but his sister, Marilyn Doige Bovard, testified at the trial that the work was created by her late brother. In a written statement after the verdict, Doig said of the   trial that “justice prevailed, but it was way too long in coming” according to the BBC. “That a living artist has to defend the authorship of his own work should never have come to pass. ” A lawyer for the plaintiffs has not yet decided whether they will appeal the decision.",-0.5

"In Historic Trial, Mayan Women Accuse Ex-Military Officers Of Sex Slavery. Last week, a historic trial began in Guatemala. It’s believed to be the first time any national court has held a trial to prosecute sex slavery during an armed conflict. Two former military officers stand accused of murder, kidnapping and keeping nearly a dozen indigenous women as domestic laborers and sex slaves during the country’s   civil war. The war resulted in 200, 000 deaths and 45, 000 disappearances. Most of the genocide and other crimes targeted Mayans. Michel Martin spoke with Kelsey   about the details of the trial  —   and as you can imagine, they are disturbing.   is director of the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, which has a representative at the trial. ”When you look at the victims of the violence in Guatemala, the vast majority [was] indigenous Mayans  —   about 83 percent according to the U. N. Truth Commission . .. and about 93 percent of the human rights violations were carried out by the military,”   says. ”So there was definitely an ethnic component.” On the women’s testimonies, The women in this case are in their 70s and 80s. They speak Q’eqchi’ a Mayan language. First their husbands disappeared. Their husbands were working to legalize their land in this area that was principally owned by large,   families. The women that were left alone after their husbands disappeared were then targeted by the military that had set up a series of military outposts in this region in Guatemala. And they forced the women to live right outside the military base and to do shifts where they would go cook for the soldiers, clean for the soldiers and as part of that, they were also repeatedly raped during those shifts. So for some women, that repeated rape happened over a period of days or months and for some women it happened over a period of years. Four women were able to escape and one woman tells of how she fled into the mountains with her four children. Her children lived through hunger, fear, disease  —   and six years later . .. she only had one surviving child with her. On the defense, In this particular case, no one is denying that these women were abused. What we’ve seen so far is actually rather than a legal defense, we’ve seen the lawyers of the two accused simply try to delay the trial, to say that they don’t think that the trial is legitimate. We have not seen any kind of defense presented. . .. We all have every hope that it will reach a conclusion, that there will be a verdict based on rule of law and strong evidence. However, the Guatemalan justice system still has huge challenges, so I do hope that the conditions are right for this trial to move forward effectively. On the women’s current   These women have spent almost their entire lives in situations of extreme poverty. They have health implications from that violence that has not been dealt with because they have not had access to medical care. And one of the scariest things that I think I’ve heard from a couple of the women who I’ve spoken with recently, is that they fear that these types of things can happen again, and so the women want to denounce what happened and, most importantly, they don’t want other women to have to go through the same thing.",-0.5
"Marco Rubio Is Plenty Conservative. It is now axiomatic that Marco Rubio is the “establishment” favorite in the 2016 Republican primaries, due for a collision with a conservative alternative such as Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, or Ben Carson. But if Rubio really represents the new GOP “establishment,” then the fight is over and the conservatives won. Despite infuriating many grassroots conservatives by pushing the failed Gang of Eight   bill and advocating a path to legalization, Rubio has an indisputably conservative record as a senator. Across the board, Rubio’s stances, policy proposals, and rhetoric fall squarely within the bounds of traditional conservatism. Rubio’s the guy who earned a 100 from National Right to Life in two straight cycles, and a zero rating from NARAL. He supports an abortion ban after 20 weeks, opposes exceptions for rape and incest (although he’s voted for legislation that includes those exceptions) and opposes embryonic   research. In the first Republican debate he declared, “Future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live. ” Since 2010, Rubio has proposed freezing government spending for everything but defense and veterans’ care at 2008 levels. He supports a   amendment to the Constitution and the   veto. He voted against funding for the   Bank, even though Florida receives the   amount of money from the bank. His initial   plan,   with Utah senator Mike Lee, cuts the corporate tax rate to 25 percent and would reduce the current seven brackets to two: a 15 percent rate for individuals and a 35 percent rate for families. (Rubio later adjusted it to create a 25 percent tax bracket for couples making between $150, 000 and $300, 000.) It creates a new $   tax credit. Conservatives disagree about the best way to simplify the tax code and reduce the tax burden on Americans, but it’s hard to dispute that changes such as these would move the system in the right direction. He wants to create a tax credit for companies that donate to nonprofits that give K —  12 tuition scholarships to poor students. In 2013, he declared that Common Core “is increasingly being used by the Obama Administration to turn the Department of Education into what is effectively a national school board. ” He thinks children should be taught both theistic creation and evolution. On Obamacare, Rubio was the one who made the   insurer bailout an issue, starting in 2013, which led to Congress’s enacting limits on how much taxpayer money insurers could be given to cover losses related to the newly insured. Insurance companies that spent small fortunes lobbying for the bill and fighting its opponents are now griping that they’re getting a bad deal and the law may eventually become unworkable for them. If Obamacare is eventually replaced, Rubio will have played a big role in making it happen. He’s got the guts for entitlement reform, too. He wants to raise the retirement age for those under 55, change the benefit calculation for wealthy seniors who do not rely on Social Security, and eliminate the Social Security payroll tax after retirement age to encourage older Americans to stay in the workforce. He wants to open federal workers’ Thrift Savings Program to all Americans. Rubio opposes raising the minimum wage, contending it would only encourage employers to search for new technological solutions to replace American workers he contends the legislative efforts to fight climate change are economically   and expresses skepticism that human behavior is driving climate change. In the Florida senate, he won bipartisan support for a law restricting the state’s authority to seize private property after the Kelo v. New London decision. Share article on FacebookshareTweet While conservatives disagree on how much military interventionism is needed in a dangerous world, Rubio’s   stances are of a piece with the party’s recent history. In May, Rush Limbaugh said Rubio “shows up on the Council on Foreign Relations and literally ran rings around everybody, including Jeb Bush. ” The Wall Street Journal editorial board called him “one of his party’s most visible and   critics of President Obama’s foreign policy in Ukraine, Iran, and a Middle East beset by Islamic State. ” He’s called for a $1 trillion expansion of the defense budget. On that   issue of immigration,   opposition to the Gang of Eight bill was  . Rubio deserves every bit of grief he’s getting for ruling out a path to citizenship in 2010, and then supporting a bill that would have created such a path in 2013. But it’s rewriting history to call Rubio a squish on border security or an advocate for an “open border,” as Rand Paul has charged. Representative Mo Brooks (R. Ala.) contends Rubio “led the effort to open the floodgates. ” But the Florida senator has always agreed with calls for greater border security. While the Gang of Eight bill was still making its way through Congress, Rubio argued that it should be amended to include specific enforcement procedures preventing another influx of illegal immigrants. He helped negotiate an adopted amendment that would have roughly doubled the   force to 40, 000 agents while completing 700 miles of fence on the nation’s southern border. The   Senate Judiciary Committee rejected numerous amendments that would have improved the bill and assured skeptics that the   provisions were more than just  . Rubio applauded the amendments that passed, which aimed to make   requirements more specific, allow DHS to more vigorously track, pursue, and remove persons who overstay their visas, and require updates on the implementation of  . Conservatives can argue whether the enforcement provisions were enough, but that doesn’t make Rubio an   advocate. Why do so many people see Rubio as some sort of squishy moderate if his voting record and proposals are so thoroughly conservative? More Marco Rubio Sessions: ‘I Do Not’ Know If Trump Records White House ConversationsMarco Rubio and Ivanka Trump Team Up on Tax ReformStop Trolling Politicians at   MeetingsPeter Beinart argues that the Florida senator uses a warm, empathetic tone to promote conservative policies: “Rubio has mastered the same technique Barack Obama used so effectively when he was seeking the presidency,” Beinart writes. “When faced with a controversial issue, he doffs his cap to the other side, pleads for civility and respect, insists that it’s a hard call  —   and then comes out exactly where you’d expect him to come out. ” Judging from the number of people calling Rubio a RINO, squish, establishment, etc. perhaps Rubio is a victim of his own golden tongue. If the perception that Rubio is too moderate costs him the GOP nomination, it will reveal a great deal about what defines a conservative in 2016. Sadly, the label no longer has much to do with actual policy positions, ideas, or governing philosophies. If Rubio is no longer conservative, then conservatism is now primarily a matter of aesthetics.,",1.0

"Mitch McConnell Sees ‘High Level of Satisfaction’ With Trump Administration - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don’t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  —   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  —   might not really be one of them. “The country doesn’t need saving,” Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. “I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,” he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. “Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. ” He added: “No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  —   from our perspective  —      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. ” Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president’s “drain the swamp” initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  —   inside and outside Congress  —   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. “Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,” Mr. McConnell recalled. “But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. “It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell’s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. “We have had very good unity on our side,” Mr. McConnell said. “People are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don’t find any decision that he has made surprising. ” He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. “A lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?” Mr. McConnell said. “He used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. ” It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president’s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell’s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. “It is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,” Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party’s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. “Sooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,” Mr. McConnell said. “Hopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. ” His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?",-1.0
"Obama tells Trump to ’stop whining’ over rigged election claims.  U. S. President Barack Obama lacerated Donald Trump on Tuesday over his repeated assertions that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him, telling the Republican presidential candidate to ”stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” With opinion polls showing him falling further back against his White House rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump has intensified his allegations, although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U. S. elections is rare. At a campaign rally in Grand Junction, Colorado, Trump continued his attack, saying, ”The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters.” But he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president: a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of Congress, six years for members of the House of Representatives, 12 years for members of the Senate. Obama was asked about Trump’s voter fraud assertions on Tuesday at a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden following meetings with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. He responded with a blistering attack on the Republican candidate, noting that U. S. elections are run and monitored by local officials, who may well be appointed by Republican governors of states, and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in American elections. Obama said there was ”no serious” person who would suggest it was possible to rig American elections, adding, ”I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.” Trump, speaking at the Grand Junction rally Tuesday evening, said that Obama should stop campaigning for ”Crooked Hillary” and ”get out and work on jobs and work on the border.” Trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the November election result, citing scant or questionable evidence, including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people, and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on Election Day. He has sharpened his allegations even as Republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded. In a report titled ”The Truth About Voter Fraud,” the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0. 00004 percent and 0. 0009 percent. An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates. In pointed remarks that were part civics lesson, Obama said that if Trump wins on Nov. 8, ”It would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech” and ”it would be my job . .. and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power” at his swearing in. Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, took a softer tone than Trump during a campaign appearance in North Carolina, saying he was ”confident” that the integrity of the election will be ensured. But Pence added that ”in recent years we’ve had instances, proven instances of voter fraud.” A number of   states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter identification requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.   Trump trails Clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics. CONTROVERSIES ECLIPSE POLICY DISCUSSION Over the last few weeks, Trump, who has never previously run for office, has been embroiled in one controversy after another, eclipsing policy issues such as taxes, trade, the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns. With three weeks left until Election Day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states, Trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. He has said the remarks were just ”locker room” talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say Trump groped or touched them inappropriately, denouncing his accusers as liars and  . The controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates, to be held on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas. Trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate. He appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate, but according to polling, more voters saw Clinton as the victor. Wednesday’s debate, like the first one, will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions. Topics chosen by moderator Chris Wallace include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots, and fitness to be president.  At Tuesday’s press conference, Obama also criticized Trump for his ”continued flattery” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying ”it is out of step with” the country. Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and on Monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the Russian leader before he is even sworn in as president.

"Montana congressman is Trump’s choice for interior secretary.  (CNN)  Donald Trump has chosen Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke as his nominee to lead the Interior Department. A transition official said Zinke has accepted the offer. Zinke, a      SEAL commander and recipient of two Bronze Stars for combat missions in Iraq, was a Trump supporter.

As far as users are concerned, MariaDB is essentially a drop-in replacement for MySQL that isn’t linked to Oracle, which — thanks to its acquisition of Sun, which acquired MySQL — is currently the corporate home of the open-source database. “On behalf of the Board of Directors, the MariaDB Foundation welcomes Microsoft as a Platinum member,” MariaDB (and MySQL) founder Monty Widenius writes in today’s announcement. “I founded MariaDB to give back to the open source community and ensure a strong and open future for MySQL. I’ve seen firsthand how Microsoft has been changing its business in an open way, and how Microsoft Azure is open and flexible. Microsoft is a leading contributor on GitHub and we look forward to engineers from Microsoft and its developer ecosystem supporting MariaDB.” Widenius always had a very pragmatic view of open source. A few years ago, he left SkySQL, which is now the MariaDB Corp. (which commercializes the database) to start the MariaDB Foundation, but then came back to MariaDB Corp. as its CTO. As for Microsoft, it’s worth noting that the company is definitely embracing open source at this point. It’s now a sponsor of the Linux Foundation and some of that group’s projects, as well as the Open Source Initiative, the Cloud Foundry Foundation and others.",0.0
"Andy McCarthy: Sentencing Reform Bill Slipping Through Congress Without Hearings ’Worst Combination of Bad Elements Coming Together’ - Breitbart. Andy McCarthy, a senior fellow at National Review and former Assistant U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, joined SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the pending sentencing reform bill.  McCarthy worried that bad legislation will slip through Congress while public attention was focused on the “soap opera” of the presidential primaries. “We have a President who has no more elections to worry about, and who is into doing all kinds of mischief,” he said.  “Nothing makes more mischief than lack of attention, and lack of sunlight on it. ” McCarthy warned there is “an awful lot going on that people aren’t going to like, and when they wake up to it, they’re going to be very unhappy. ” McCarthy agreed with Bannon’s suggestion that our political and media elites have no idea how much ordinary Americans suffer from crime, ranging from drug offenses and violent assault to wanton violation of U. S. immigration law. “I think they’re really removed from it, because they really don’t live among the problems that get created,” said McCarthy. He added that it was also a “big problem” that American politics have been reshaped by young people who don’t remember the excesses of liberalism, and certainly haven’t been taught about the bad old days by the leftist educational or media establishments. “I, for example, grew up in   Bronx,” he said.  “Remember, we had the World Series where the Bronx was burning down.  People of a certain age  —   even people who are, say, in their thirties today  —   have no idea what New York city was like before, say, 1989 or so.  And they’ve grown up in cities that, because of the crackdown on crime that was carried out, really, from the early Eighties going forward.  They live in a different America than people who grew up in the Fifties, Sixties, and early Seventies remember.  And they think it was always this way. ” “It doesn’t seem to them like it’s such a big deal.  What’s the problem?  You let some people out of jail,” said McCarthy.  “You should have grown up in America when it was   America, and where we had the radical groups of the Sixties.  It was a different place.  And I hate the thought that we’re going back to it.  It’s just  . ”  Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST. LISTEN:  ",1.0
"The Rise of the American ’Others’.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Something unusual has been taking       place with the United States Census: A minor category that has existed for more than 100 years is elbowing its way forward. “Some Other Race,” a category that first entered the form as simply “Other” in 1910, was the   category after “White” and “Black” in 2010, alarming officials, who are concerned that if nothing is done ahead of the 2020 census, this   category of people could become the   racial group in the United States. A Federal Judge’s Ruling Against North Carolina’s HB2, Among those officials is Roberto Ramirez, the assistant division chief of the Census Bureau’s special population statistics branch. Ramirez is familiar with the complexities of filling out the census form: He checks “White” and “Some Other Race” to reflect his Hispanic ethnicity. Ramirez joins a growing share of respondents who are selecting “Some Other Race. ” “People are increasingly not answering the race question. They are not identifying with the current categories, so we are trying to come up with a (better) question,” Ramirez told me. Ramirez and his colleague, Nicholas Jones, the director of race and ethnic research and outreach at the Census Bureau, have been working on   the form to extract detailed race and ethnic reporting, and subsequently drive down the number of people selecting “Some Other Race. ” The U. S. census form has evolved over 226 years. “Race is the oldest question we have in this country,” Ramirez said. “We asked it in our first census in 1790, and we have been asking it ever since, every 10 years in a different way and different shape, but consistently throughout. ” “White” has been the only consistent racial term since August 1790, when marshals knocked on doors in the original 13 states and in the districts of Kentucky, Maine, Vermont, and the Southwest territory (Tennessee) to classify people as a “Free White Males” or “Free White Females,” “Slave,” or “All Other Free Persons. ” The   era was a pivotal moment for how census data was used, Jones said. “Prior to that, the measurement of race and ethnicity in the census was often used, not for helping people, but to show how people can be differentiated,” he told me. “But from the 1960s onwards, the measurement was really used to address problems and concerns. ” Today, it also serves to reapportion congressional seats and Electoral College votes. A number of factors affect census results. Take, for example, an increase in   mixed families. Among marriages in the United States, 15 percent are between people of different racial and ethnic origins, according to Richard Alba, a sociology professor at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. Alba’s research also found that one in seven infants are born into an   mixed family. “This is a really new and    possibly important development because these are individuals who grow up in families that involve whites and minorities. They are truly straddling the dividing lines in American society,” he said. “We don’t really know enough about them to be able to say how they will identify themselves, how they will locate themselves within American society. ” In 1977, the Office of Management and Budget, which supervises the U. S. Census Bureau, issued a directive on racial and ethnic classification for federal statistics. Ethnicity —  such as “Hispanic” and “not Hispanic” —  was separate and distinct from the concept of race. As a result, the “Some Other Race” category captured a lot of Hispanics. Twenty years later, the OMB issued a fresh directive, allowing respondents to report more than one race on the 2000 census form. The racial categories available were: “White,” “Black,   or Negro,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” and “Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. ” The “Latino” classification was also introduced as an alternative phrasing for the “Hispanic” ethnic category. But the “Some Other Race” category, long part of the census, was not mentioned in the OMB directive. Instead, the Census Bureau decided to keep it to capture respondents who didn’t identify with any of the other categories provided. Still, to address the country’s changing demographic landscape, the Census Bureau frequently conducts tests in between decennial censuses. In August 2015, the bureau sent a questionnaire dubbed the National Content Test to 1. 2 million households. It had two objectives, according to John Thompson, the director of the U. S. Census Bureau, “to evaluate and compare different versions of questions to ask in the 2020 census, such as those about race and origin,” and to encourage households to respond to the census online, the cheapest and most efficient option. The questionnaire emulated another experiment also aimed at eliciting detailed race and ethnic reporting known as the Race and Hispanic Origin Alternative Questionnaire Experiment. It involved half a million households and was conducted close on the heels of the 2010 census. The results showed that the bureau would be better off scrapping the separate “Hispanic” ethnicity question on the census form and putting it alongside the list of categories asking for a person’s race. In doing so, the census results were more reliable —  and valuable —  since a larger share of people reported their race. In fact, in the experiment sample, “Some Other Race” declined from 7 percent of the population to less than 1 percent. But   participants who ran alongside the AQE raised a series of questions: What was the census form really asking? Some felt “race” and “origin” were the same. Others believed “race” was defined as skin color, ancestry, or culture, while “origin” referred to where they or their parents were born. The takeaway: The terms were confusing and needed to be defined or eliminated altogether. The bureau’s   moderators went a step further, asking questions to try to understand participants’ “situational identity,” too, recognizing that respondents discussed and reported on their race differently depending on the context in which questions were asked. They explored themes of awareness and fluidity with questions such as, “When did you first become aware of your race?” to understand if and how racial identity changed over time. Jones noted that “the categories are not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically, but we know that some people interpret it that way. ” Census officials also found that people were more likely to report their race as long as they had a way to express their  . “If you look at the current way we ask the race and ethnicity questions, one of the issues you will see here is that we don’t have a   line for ‘White’ or ‘Black,’ so many groups went down to the ‘Some Other Race’ category,” Jones told me. When space was offered for people to write in their choices, respondents seldom checked the box that said “White” or “Black” and instead wrote in “Irish” or “Jamaican” or similar. “The proportions were very different, too. It went from 3 to 5 percent of the white or black population giving the bureau detailed responses, to over 50 percent of whites and 75 percent of blacks using the   lines,” he said. Tweaks and additions to the form continue today. A new category dubbed “MENA” was tested during the 2015 NCT in an attempt to allow respondents who may have Middle Eastern, North African, or Arab roots to identify themselves. In the combined question format of the experiment sample, the “MENA” category was included as the seventh race, after “Hispanics. ” “What we observed in the AQE and the focus groups were that the Middle Eastern and North African population saying that they didn’t see themselves in the current categories,” Jones said. Last year, the Census Bureau met with the Arab American Institute and leading Middle Eastern and Arab American scholars, activists, and organizations to discuss including it to the form in 2020. This and other data collected from the NCT will be instrumental in shaping the 2020 census form. After the studies are conducted and the recommendations are made, the Census Bureau is required to submit its report to Congress followed by an outline of the questions in 2018 for approval.  “The objective of the NCT was to collect detailed information on ethnic and racial groups, which is what the public has been demanding,” Jones said. “It is more than just our quest to have identities validated, to be able to say, ‘This is who I am,’ but it is also to get data back for (government) programs —  information that tells us who we are. ” 	A bartender’s camera captures the seedy street life of retro New York.",-0.5
"Seattle Woman Told to Change Clothes or Find a New Airline - Breitbart. A Seattle, WA burlesque dancer says she was stripped of her dignity when an airline told her to change her clothes or find a new flight, according to a KOMO News report.  The dancer, whose stage name is Maggie McMuffin, says she was on a JetBlue flight when an airline worker told her the pilot found her shorts inappropriate. McMuffin said it was her only outfit, but she says she offered a compromise. “I could tie a sweater around my waist,” she said. “I could get a blanket from you guys, and they said, ‘If you don’t change your clothes, you’re not going to be able to board this flight. ’” A JetBlue spokesperson later said, “Our contract of carriage allows JetBlue to deny boarding to any customer whose clothing may be offensive to the viewing public. We support our crew members’ discretion to make these difficult decisions. ” According to McMuffin, JetBlue offered to rebook her flight, but she ran through the terminal to purchase another pair of shorts to catch the original flight. She feels disrespected for her experience. “I would say body shaming and slut shaming more than outright sexism, but it is really hard to remove those two things from misogyny,” McMuffin told KOMO. The airline offered an apology and a $162 flight credit, but McMuffin wants the airline to offer sensitivity training to its pilots. She also thinks JetBlue should be more clear with its customer expectations. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo",1.0
"Can Dementia Be Prevented? Education May Bolster Brain Against Risk. The odds of getting Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia are declining for people who are more educated and avoiding heart disease, a study finds. The results suggest that people may have some control over their risk of dementia as they age. This isn’t the first study to find that the incidence of dementia is waning, but it may be the best so far. Researchers looked at 30 years of records from more than 5, 000 people in the famed Framingham Heart Study, which has closely tracked the health of volunteers in Framingham, Mass. They found that the incidence of dementia declined about 20 percent per decade starting in the 1970s  —   but only in people who had at least a high school education. The decline in people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s wasn’t statistically significant, but there were fewer people with Alzheimer’s, which could have affected that result. The study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, also looked at risk factors for heart disease and stroke, including smoking, obesity and high blood pressure. They found that the people who had better markers for cardiovascular health, such as normal blood pressure, were also less likely to develop dementia. ”That’s telling us that perhaps better management of cardiovascular disease could potentially help in the reduction of dementia,” says Claudia Satizabal, an author of the study and an instructor in neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine. To figure out what this all means, we called Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor at the University of Michigan who also studies trends in dementia. Here are highlights from the conversation edited for length and clarity. One of the very confusing things about this is that even though an individual may be less likely to get dementia than they were 40 years ago, the number of people with dementia is going up. Why is that? It’s an interesting and sometimes complicated concept. The number of cases in the population could still be going up in the future because of the larger number of adults. It’s very easy to get your wires crossed when you think of ”what’s my own individual risk” versus the number of people in the population. It’s certain that we’ll have significantly more older people in the United States and around the world, so now the big question is  —   on an individual level, what’s going on with the risk? Does a    today have the same risk as one 20 years ago? And you’re finding a trend similar to what the researchers reported this week  —   a declining risk of dementia in the United States.  We’ve been looking at data from the Health and Retirement Study, large study funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security Administration. We’ve been collecting data on older folks in the United States since 1992. We’re finding a decline in the prevalence of dementia and cognitive decline very much in line with the Framingham Study report. You also are finding that a person’s level of education is a key driver in dementia risk. Is that because education makes your brain stronger, or that educated people are healthier overall?  That’s a big question, and one I’ll be focusing on for the rest of my career. I’ll give you my usual researcher    answer: I think it’s a bit of both. I do think there is a direct biological effect of using your brain and having it interact with the world. You may have heard the term cognitive reserve, which means your brain gets wired up differently if it’s challenged. I’m a believer that there is a causal effect of education on how your brain is challenged. But I definitely would agree that that’s not the only pathway. Education sets you off on a different path in your life it sends you into different occupations. You may live in different neighborhoods, have less stress, have more money. That gives you access to better health care and social networks. But still, if I do my 12 years or 14 years or 16 years of school, I don’t think that 100 percent determines your risk of dementia. You’ve also found that our parents’ level of education may affect dementia risk. It’s very intriguing a mother’s education may be more important than a father’s education. Again there are lots of complicated pathways you can talk about, but one that we and other researchers are trying to follow up on is whether a more educated mom may interact with a child in ways that are more beneficial to the developing brain of a child. How your brain is nurtured throughout life is a really fascinating part of this story. The study published this week didn’t look explicitly at exercise, but that does affect cardiovascular health. Could it help prevent dementia? The evidence both from animals in the cage and epidemiological studies shows that physical activity seems quite important for keeping your blood vessels healthy, and probably some specific growth factors that help the neurons in the brain. The general point that was brought out in the Framingham study is that cardiovascular fitness is very important. You and other researchers have pointed out that the trend toward more obesity and diabetes in the United States could threaten this more hopeful trend toward lower risk of dementia. When might that happen? The short answer is I think we don’t know. Again, there are so many complicated interacting pathways going on here we can’t really be sure what will happen. Even though the number of people with diabetes has really skyrocketed in the past 20 or 30 years, it also seems to be that having diabetes doesn’t have as many bad complications as it did 20 or 30 years ago. There’s been a decline in things like heart attacks and amputations due to vascular complications. More aggressive treatment of diabetes and high blood pressure and cholesterol is probably one of the factors that’s caused this decline in complications. We’re all terrified of getting Alzheimer’s. Given that being heart healthy seems to reduce that risk, why aren’t we all exercising like crazy?  It’s still complicated, I think. Part of it is that it’s a benefit that’s going to come to you 20 or 25 years later it’s not easy to motivate people even with something as feared as Alzheimer’s disease. I’m an internist. I see   people with diabetes and hypertension and tell them about these findings. But it can be tough to motivate people. What else can people do to reduce the risk?  These findings are optimistic it’s not a done deal. But there do seem to be things we can do not only from an individual perspective but from a public policy perspective, for instance, making education as available as possible to people in the United States and other countries. I tell my patients, ”You can do everything right and still get Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.” It’s a question of trying to change your risk to make it as low as possible. The research that is ongoing to find medical interventions to affect the trajectory of the disease are still important to do also.",-0.5
"AB InBev agrees to concessions with South Africa over SAB deal    .    InBev ( ) will invest 1 billion rand ($69 million) to support small South African farmers as part of concessions agreed with the government to secure regulatory approval for its $100   takeover of SABMiller SAB. L, it said on Thursday. The world’s biggest brewer said the concessions, which also include a   freeze on layoffs, were agreed with the South African Ministry of Economic Development.  ”It is expected that the agreement on terms between government and the merger parties will expedite the merger proceedings before the South African competition authorities,”  AB InBev said.   ”The commitments made by the company are the most extensive   undertakings made to date in a large merger. In our view, they meet the requirements of the competition legislation,” Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said. South African Competition Commission this week extended its scrutiny of the deal, saying it needed at another 15 days to complete its investigation. It has already extended the deadline four times. South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving takeovers partly because competition authorities have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs, in addition to an   mandate to protect competition. In 2011, the regulator told U. S. retailer   Stores ( ) not to cut jobs for two years following its acquisition of South African retailer Massmart ( ) delaying implementation of the $2. 4 billion deal by at least two months. The Commission investigates deals for any   issues and submits its views to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling on whether a deal should go ahead Ab InBev has already told European regulators of its plan to sell SABMiller’s premium European brands to try to secure approval for its deal.  BRUSSELS French carmaker PSA Group  secured unconditional EU antitrust approval on Wednesday to acquire General Motors’  German unit Opel, a move which will help it better compete with market leader Volkswagen .

"BBC: Thatcher Most Powerful Woman of Last 70 Years. Margaret Thatcher has topped the BBC Woman’s Hour list of most influential woman of the last 70 years, but the judges stressed that the list honours those who made a “negative impact” as well as a positive. [Otherwise peopled by progressive icons, the judges admit that her selection was a point of “enormous contention”.  Next on the list is Helen Brooks, who in the 1960s first made contraception available for unmarried women, although the judges have said the six figures to follow Lady Thatcher come in no particular order. The fictional character Bridget Jones, who spearheaded the celebration of female angst, also makes an appearance. For the last two years, Woman’s Hour has compiled an    list marking the global impact of women on other women. But this year, to mark 70 years since the programme’s launch, it has expanded the remit, choosing seven women from the last seven decades who epitomised female power. The panel of seven female judges was chaired by journalist Emma Barnett, who said that Lady Thatcher had been awarded the top spot as “she redefined power”. Stressing that impact did not always have to be positive, Barnett added that Lady Thatcher had galvanised a generation of women in opposition to her. “Thatcher was one of the most iconic leaders of the 20th century, regardless of gender,” she said. “These are all things you can’t deny. She shaped how women viewed what it was to be a woman in power, from the way people articulated themselves to the way people dressed. “She shattered the glass ceiling into tiny splinters and just by having a woman in power, little girls knew they could do it  —   even if it’s not the power you would have wanted. ” Fellow panellist Ayesha Hazarika, a former adviser to the Labour MP Harriet Harman, made it clear that she was “uncomfortable” with the Baroness’s appointment. But she conceded: “Whether you loved her or loathed her, hers was a very significant achievement. [Mrs.] Thatcher shaped a generation and shaped a period in British history. “I think she had a massively negative impact on society and on women but she was important because she showed that just because you [have] a woman in Downing Street does not mean you have a feminist prime minister or a feminist government. ” Beyond the judging room, however, Bridget Jones has proved to be the more controversial pick. Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey tweeted: “I did not have a vote, nor did [  Jenni Murray]. Our panel of judges decided. Would I have picked Bridget Jones? No. ” While comedian David Baddiel said: “The fact that one of the women on the Women’s Hour Power List is *not real* suggests perhaps that that old glass ceiling remains reinforced. ” But Barnett defended the pick on the grounds that the list was chosen on the basis of those who “actually had impact in real women’s lives”. She added that “impact doesn’t have to be good, bad, serious or funny”. The character “gave permission for our own imperfections  …     we still have huge image issues in this country” Barnett explained. Bridget Jones’s creator Helen Fielding quipped: “I hope it doesn’t mean everyone’s going to binge drink and eat Milk Tray late at night. ” Also on the list are Barbara Castle, who introduced the Equal Pay Act 1970 feminist Germaine Greer Jayaben Desai, who led the strikers in the 1976 Grunwick dispute in London and the singer Beyoncé.",1.0

Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said in a statement Thursday. “I am horrified that people connected to the incoming administration are using my family’s experience as a precedent for what President-elect Donald Trump could do,” added Takano, who supported Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE in the presidential election. “These comments confirm many Americans’ worst fears about the Trump administration, and they reflect an alarming resurgence of racism and xenophobia in our political discourse.” A supporter of Trump’s on Wednesday cited the Japanese-American internment camps as precedent for the Republican president-elect's rumored registry of Muslim immigrants. “It is legal; they say it will hold constitutional muster,” Carl Higbie, a former Navy SEAL, said on Fox News. ""I know the [American Civil Liberties Union] is going to challenge it, but I think it will pass. “And we’ve done with Iran — back a while ago, we did it during World War II with Japanese, which, call it what you will, it may be wrong,” he added as Fox News host Megyn Kelly interjected. Kelly then admonished Higbie’s comparison, saying he knew “better to suggest that” example to viewers. “I’m just saying there’s precedent for it, I’m not saying I agree with it, but in this case I absolutely believe,” he began before Kelly briefly cut him off again. “Look, the president needs to protect America first, and if that means having people that are not protected under our Constitution have sort of registry so we can understand — until we can identify the true threat and where it’s coming from, I support it,” he concluded. Other Democrats joined Takano in criticizing those remarks. Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Calif.) called the remarks ""outrageous, unacceptable and reckless"" in a statement. ""The unjust internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a painful period during our history, but we have taken great strides as a country to heal those wounds and move forward."" Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, on Thursday said both internment camps and registering Muslims violate basic American values. “Any proposal to force American Muslims to register with the federal government, and to use Japanese imprisonment during World War II as a precedent, is abhorrent and has no place in our society,” she said in a statement. The ACLU said Thursday that it would pursue legal action against the Trump administration if it violated Muslim Americans’ civil rights. “If the Trump administration proceeds to discriminate against our Muslim neighbors, families, and friends, we will sue,” Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project, said in a statement.

"The Pillaging of America’s State Universities. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. America’s great public research universities, which produce   discoveries and train some of the country’s most talented young students, are under siege. The result may be a significant weakening of the nation’s preeminence in higher education. Dramatic cuts in public spending for state flagship universities seem to be at odds with widespread public sentiment. Americans say they strongly believe in exceptional educational systems they want their kids to attend excellent and selective colleges and to get good,   prestigious jobs. They also support university research. After 15 years of surveys, Research! America found in 2015 that 70 percent of American adults supported   basic scientific research like that produced by public universities, while a significant plurality (44 percent) supported paying higher taxes for medical research designed to cure diseases like cancer or Alzheimer’s. Nonetheless, many state legislators seem to be ignoring public opinion as they essentially starve some of the best universities —  those that educate about   of American college students. According to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences’ recently completed Lincoln Project report, between 2008 and 2013 states reduced financial support to top public research universities by close to 30 percent. At the same time, these states increased support of prisons by more than 130 percent. New York City’s budget office reported in 2013 that incarcerating a person in a state prison cost the city roughly $168, 000 a year. California apparently does it on the cheap: It costs roughly $64, 000 annually for each prisoner —  a bit more than the cost of a year at an Ivy League university (average tuition is $50, 000) and far more than at the University of California, Berkeley, ($13, 000) or at CUNY ($8, 000). The withdrawal of state funds is often one of the direct causes of increased college tuition —  not necessarily an increase in faculty size, spending on construction, or administrative costs. Yet, many state policymakers attribute the increased tuition to wasteful spending by the universities. To fill the financial hole, state universities are going national and international —  admitting many more    and foreign students, who sometimes pay as much as three times the tuition of state residents. Today, families pay more than half of the cost of a   degree. In 1970 —  a period during which   wages stagnated —  they paid about  . The tuition at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, this year is roughly $7, 000 for the first two years $9, 000 for the second two, according to school officials, (not the $55, 000 commonly attributed to Ivy League universities). And these figures represent the sticker price, not the discounted price after taking into account financial aid.  At the two largest public systems of higher learning (the City University of New York and the California system) the average tuition runs from about $8, 000 to $13, 000 a year —  the price tag at UC Berkeley. For example, fully 60 percent of City University undergraduates pay no tuition after taking into account financial aid, such as Pell grants and state support. And again, as student tuition and fees rise, the United States spends between $60 billion and $80 billion a year on its incarceration system. Meanwhile, it charges interest on student loans that yields roughly $66 billion off of six years of federal student loans, and $51 billion in 2013 alone, according to the Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Some argue that   debt could be reduced dramatically if the government charged students the same interest on their loans as it charges banks to obtain money. And if the United States reduced or eliminated the unnecessary hundreds of thousands of people (predominantly minorities) who wallow in jails for multiple   misdemeanors, perhaps it could invest in the higher education of a great many more of its young people —  and thus create many more productive members of society. A type of delusional thinking seems to convince American policymakers that excellent public colleges and universities can continue to be great without serious investment. As the former Secretary of State and Stanford University provost Condoleezza Rice and Joel Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor, wrote in a Council of Foreign Relations report,   investments are a form of national security at least as important as direct investments in bombers, military drones, missiles, or warships. In other words, these education investments have a very high payoff for states, the nation, and the larger world. All this amounts, arguably, to a pillaging of the country’s greatest state universities. And that pillaging is not a matter of necessity, as many elected officials would insist —  it’s a matter of choice. If Wisconsin’s governor and legislature succeed in eliminating or emasculating tenure for faculty members at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, they can say goodbye to the greatness of that institution of higher learning. If Florida’s governor asks students in the humanities or arts to pay higher tuition than those who major in business or STEM subjects, Florida’s universities are apt to deteriorate in quality. And just so it doesn’t seem like I’m cherry picking, consider what North Carolina’s governor said not long ago: “If you want to take gender studies, that’s fine, go to a private school and take it. But I don’t want to subsidize that if that’s not going to get someone a job. ” The consequence of such policy choices, it seems, is that tuition will go up and access for kids from poorer families will go down. But such outcomes can be prevented. Those in the voting public who believe that they can get something for nothing or that quality will simply materialize out of the ether can revisit their assumptions. Governments can increase the marginal tax rates on substantial incomes so that those who have benefitted most from the nation’s prosperity pay a fair share of taxes that enables both access and educational opportunity for talented young people. The United States currently has one of the lowest marginal tax rates in the industrial world. Transferred resources from the very rich (less than 1 percent of nation’s population controls more than 25 percent of its wealth) corporations, and from   institutions could build a more robust educational system in our country. There are important positive consequences in economic growth from such investments at the state and local level, as has been demonstrated in studies of Silicon Valley and in the area surrounding Boston. In short, today essentially everyone who attends Berkeley pays a maximum of around $13, 500 a year —  even if his or her parents are billionaires. At Stanford or at Ivy League  universities that same student would pay (and could afford to pay) the full sticker price of tuition (around $50, 000 a year) but the youngster from a poorer economic background might well go free. There is not enough differentiation in tuition pricing between those who come from very wealthy background and those whose parents can barely make ends meet. Are Public Universities Going to Disappear? Higher education also needs more political leaders who are willing to risk their jobs by committing to ostensibly risky investments in   and higher education. Every elected politician should have quitting issues —  in short, be willing to resign or risk reelection when others undermine his or her core values. Take the former Connecticut Governor and Congressman Lowell Weicker, who was willing to sacrifice his leadership positions in defense of his tax policies. It’s time for the states and the federal government to step up to the need to invest creatively in education and raise public awareness about the wisdom of these investments. And it’s time for more members of the voting public to support candidates who meet this description. Finally, it’s up to the federal government to become an even more active player in supporting the quality of and access to higher public education, just as it did in 1862 when during the Civil War it passed the great Morrill Act that established the   universities —  and as it did after World War II when it passed the G. I. Bill. As Benjamin Franklin, who gave a good deal of thought to higher learning and founded the University of Pennsylvania, once said: “An investment in knowledge pays the best dividend. ” This investment is a choice that the country must make if the United States wants to maintain a leadership role among the community of nations in the 21st century.",-0.5

"Why Trump’s No. 2 donor isn’t asking for much. Washington (CNN) He doesn’t demand the President hire his   people. He doesn’t ask aspirants to genuflect en route to his palatial home. He didn’t even attend the inauguration. Bernie Marcus isn’t getting much for his $7 million. The   and first CEO of Home Depot has none of the pizzazz of the famous Mercer, Adelson or Thiel families who used their sums to fund Donald Trump’s improbable White House victory and are as a result deeply intertwined with his political infrastructure. And for Marcus, the often overlooked   donor behind casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to Trump’s efforts during the presidential campaign, that’s exactly how it should be. In an age of activist donors who expect fealty from their chosen candidates, Marcus stands out as a throwback to a previous era of political billionaires with little desire to bring their own muscle to the game. Marcus appears all too content to operate on the margins of the White House, a reflection of both his shoulder shrug toward access and of his struggle to build a deep political operation that matches the depth of his pockets, according to interviews with more than a dozen people in his orbit. ”Bernie is not a guy that cares about   or anything like that,” said Gary Rabine, a longtime Marcus friend who chats about politics and Trump with him. ”He’s a no   guy, and I’m guessing that Bernie couldn’t care less whether he talks to him or not.” Trump and Marcus are not friends. But observers of the relationship say his absence from Trump’s network is unusual for a Republican who gave so much to support Trump during the campaign and implored other donors to do similarly. ”He does not relish the game,” said Mike Leven, formerly Adelson’s chief deputy who now works for Marcus projects.  In fact, despite all his contributions, Leven described Marcus as not politically energized until this cycle.  ”Bernie was never involved like Sheldon was involved,” he said, adding, ”I don’t think it’s been fun for him at all.” His aides have sought, sometimes against his wishes, to build his public profile and to have him make more demands. But the   donor has expressed more eagerness to play a round of golf or spend time with his wife, Billi, who has encouraged her husband to spend less time on politics, according to a person with knowledge of the dynamic. A     donor, In an   interview last month, Marcus detailed to CNN his relationship with the President, which he said involves occasional emails, maybe a    phone call, and an impromptu encounter at    which is 20 minutes away from his place in Florida. Marcus envisions himself as a political purist, with meager interest in the    combat of politics and little taste for flashy invitations. ”I’m one of the very few people that wants absolutely nothing from him. There’s nothing that he can do for me. Nothing. Zero,” Marcus said. ”I’m living my own life. I don’t have time for this kind of politics.” Senior Trump fundraisers recall Marcus being absent from intimate events prepared for them. Marcus, an avid golfer even as he turned 88 last week, has told his team recently that he has no interest in hitting the links with the   . They have never even dined together.  And members of the closest thing that Marcus has to a political operation, a coalition of CEOs called the Job Creators Network, say Marcus exerted almost zero pressure on the network to donate to Trump or boost him in the White House.  It’s a far cry from the legion of   donors who are routinely rewarded with treats like good seats at the inauguration, which the notorious homebody Marcus skipped. ”Other people that have done less than Bernie want to play golf with Trump. They want to have dinner with Trump. They go to the White House to see him,” said one Marcus intimate. ”He is (88) years old. He doesn’t need his ego stroked.”  Occasionally gruff, relentlessly punctual and intensely private, Marcus cuts a different shape than his new ally. Marcus came to know Trump about a decade ago when he joined Trump’s golf club in Boca Raton, sources say, and Trump came to respect the Home Depot founder’s business acumen and wealth, which is estimated at $4 billion.  ”That guy’s got real money,” Trump said of Marcus to one associate who recounted the conversation. Marcus recalls Trump pursuing him to join his golf club about a decade ago, at one point ringing his office to personally pitch him. Despite a giddy assistant who couldn’t believe ’The Apprentice’ star was on the line, Marcus wouldn’t take the call. He would later give in and join the club. Trump was not Marcus’ first choice, When White House contenders began the invisible primary in 2015 to capture commitments from donors, Marcus decided early to side with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. That January he cut Bush’s super PAC a $1 million check, before later disbursing money to back Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Marcus, for his part, was incredulous about Trump and had long seen him as a ”whimsical” character worthy of an   friends say. But Marcus watched Trump closely after Bush flamed out, assiduously avoiding   super PACs and then coming out publicly as a Trump supporter in an   that was meant for fellow GOP donors to see. Marcus’ team is confident that Trump himself saw it too. ”Republican leaders must listen to their customers, too    their voters    and they have spoken clearly,” he wrote for Real Clear Politics that spring. ”Make no mistake, Republicans who refuse to stand behind their party’s nominee are electing Clinton, whether they cast their ballots for her or not.”  Two weeks later, Marcus had 15 minutes alone with Trump when he came to Atlanta for a fundraiser. It was then that Marcus shared with Trump research from American Crossroads, the donor network founded by Karl Rove, about how to repeal regulations via executive order, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction. By the time of the Republican convention, Marcus cut a $3 million check to a   super PAC, the first of several contributions he would give over the course of the race, including millions right after Trump became embroiled in sexual harassment allegations. That October money would go to a group helmed by Rebekah Mercer, the director of a powerful New York political operation and a   influencer in Republican politics. Mercer and Marcus have struck something of a tenuous political alliance, even though they themselves are not personally close, according to people familiar with their relationship. They did not know each other well before the campaign and Marcus said he had only met Rebekah Mercer once for an hour    and he thinks highly of her. But as members of the tiny club of early Trump donors, the families have formed something of a marriage of convenience. Issue advocacy without the usual operation, Marcus does have a few pet issues. He is concerned about the rise of   on college campuses and said he plans to encourage Trump to pull federal funding from schools where it is rampant. He spoke privately with Trump last month at    about some regulations he considers onerous, including the Department of Labor’s overtime rules.  Unlike most other retail giants, Marcus says he supports the border adjustment tax    the controversial levy which Trump has now decided against    calling it a ”sacrifice that has to be made.” Jewish issues, not social ones, still animate him. Marcus has long been a key player at the hawkish Republican Jewish Coalition, an   group that has influenced his thinking on Israel and terrorism. ”He thinks about Sharia law more than your average billionaire,” said one Marcus associate.  But it is Marcus’ Job Creators Network, known as JCN, that is the closest thing he has to an actual political organization. Sources within the group however describe the founder and primary funder as very much detached from the network. Marcus tends to appear on JCN conference calls, but multiple members say they have never met Marcus personally, and that on the rare times he happens to speak, he espouses a boilerplate economic vision rather than whipping his friends into shape. ”I did not know he was a major donor,” said Ron Lazof, a Marcus friend, when asked about his efforts for Trump. ”I was intrigued by the fact that he was an early supporter of Trump,” said Blair Fensterstock, a JCN member who speaks with Marcus every few months. ”We all knew he was supportive, but he was not very vocal.” Other board members said that Marcus had never once talked about ways to politically boost Trump on the monthly calls    even though many of the CEOs were skeptical of Trump until the very end. In fact, Rabine said, it was Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who advised Trump during the campaign    not Marcus, the group’s founder    who encouraged JCN members to back Trump. ”I always felt that if the Job Creators Network was going to be a powerhouse, it needed him to be active,” said Moore, who is a senior economics analyst for CNN. ”It needs his gravitas behind it to work.” Marcus did push for Andrew Puzder, a JCN member, to be nominated as Labor Secretary, but his name was withdrawn amid vetting issues. And Marcus says he was working his JCN network behind the scenes. JCN has relatively minor asks of its   members: to donate a few thousand dollars a year, to put their names on letters or articles, and perhaps to testify before Congress once in a blue moon. It is in those ways quite dissimilar from the organizations created by billionaires Charles and David Koch, which bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from their supporters and offer them detailed briefings on their political activities at lavish conferences. That doesn’t interest Marcus, who has told associates and aides that he has no interest in building a hefty political organization or a shadow party. In fact, Marcus had harsh words for the Koch network, which have had   fights with the Trump administration in its opening months. ”They’ve made life difficult for him,” Marcus said of the powerful siblings. ”Why are you fighting him? I don’t get it. I don’t understand it, and I will probably never understand it.” For their part, the Kochs have backed other pushes by the administration, including Trump’s attempts to cut taxes and roll back regulations. Lessons learned, Marcus traces his distaste for political combat to ”very tough days” when he was seeking money for the Centers for Disease Control in the federal budget, meeting politicians who would later ask him for donations. He found the lobbying process toxic. Nevertheless, Marcus is largely steered in the ways of politics by two hands: Steven Hantler, a former automotive lobbyist who has developed a close relationship with Republican strategist Karl Rove, and Alfredo Ortiz, who runs JCN and is a past executive at Kraft and Pepsi. Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign communications adviser, also pitches in. Caputo was recently asked by the House intelligence committee to provide documents and be interviewed about unrelated matters concerning its probe into Russian election interference. Hantler often serves as Marcus’ ubiquitous   at donor conferences or candlelit dinners, which has raised some whispers in finance circles about whether he ever speaks out of turn as well as questions about his authority to make commitments. Sources say he at times sees himself as less a gatekeeper to a donor and more as a donor himself. ”Bernie Marcus was not invited to many intimate events when we were together    all of us,” said one Trump fundraiser who is close with the family. ”Hantler was going instead.” Marcus’ political work has not been without controversy. Associates say he is uneasy in the public eye given his ties to Home Depot, which must serve Trump fans and foes alike and is wary of Marcus’ partisanship. Leven said Marcus has been privately confronted on occasion at Jewish events in Atlanta for defending Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, who has been attacked by critics as  . ”Why are you defending Bannon?” Marcus found himself being asked. Marcus financed some of Bannon’s movies and said he had known him for about seven years. When Bannon was under attack at the outset of Trump’s transition, Marcus put out a rare statement declaring the controversy a ”shonda,” or travesty. By the end of the campaign, Bannon had convinced Marcus to leave Atlanta and Florida to see one Trump rally up close in Colorado, flying with the President, riding in the motorcade and seeing Trump’s movement firsthand in an experience Marcus describes as transformative. ”He’s never had such access to a president,” said one person close to Marcus. But as of this month, he has yet to even visit the White House.",-1.0

"Rand Paul: Susan Rice ’Ought to Be Under Subpoena,’ Asked If Obama Knew About Eavesdropping - Breitbart. Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Rand Paul ( ) called on former National Security Advisor Susan Rice to be brought in front of Congress under subpoena and asked questions about allegations she was behind the unmasking of American identities in raw surveillance.  Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of these alleged activities. “For years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,” Paul said. “It’s not that we’re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy’s phone calls were absorbed in a one month period of time. We were getting Merkel’s phone calls we were getting everybody’s phone calls. But by rebound we are collecting millions of Americans phone calls. If you want to look at an American’s phone call or listen to it, you should have to have a warrant, the old fashioned way in a real court where both sides get represented. ” “But a secret warrant by a secret court with a lower standard level because we’re afraid of terrorism is one thing for foreigners but both myself and a Progressive Ron Wyden have been warning about these back door searches for years and that they could be politicized,” he continued. “The facts will come out with Susan Rice. But I think she ought to be under subpoena. She should be asked did you talk to the president about it? Did President Obama know about this?

"The sanctuary movement: how religious groups are sheltering the undocumented. On a frigid Saturday night in January, Ingrid Latorre, a    woman with dark eyes and long dark hair, kept a careful eye on her    son, Anibal, as he toddled around the basement playroom of a red brick house in Denver’s Observatory Park neighborhood. Outside, the streets of the upscale residential neighborhood, which are full of children riding bikes during the day, were calm and quiet. Bryant, Ingrid’s    son, started telling me about his elementary school, a bilingual program in a suburb of Denver. Favorite subject? Math. Favorite sport? Soccer. Anibal joined the conversation, babbling as Bryant launched into a description of last year’s Halloween festivities. “My mom found me a monster mask with eyes that light up!” he said with a grin. “We all went    together  —   my dad, my mom, Anibal, Shayla [the dog] and me. And we got so much candy!” “Shayla got a lot of candy, too,” Ingrid said, dimples flashing, of the family’s stout English bulldog. “She went as a ballerina. ” Earlier in the day, about five miles   of Observatory Park, a crowd of more than 100, 000 people gathered at the Denver civic center to protest against the inauguration of Donald Trump.  Latorre, who immigrated illegally to the United States from Peru when she was 17, didn’t attend. In fact, Ingrid hasn’t left the redbrick house on Columbine Street since 28 November 2016. On that day, she and Annibal officially entered sanctuary at this house of worship for the Mountain View Friends Meeting Quaker congregation. For her own and her family’s sake, this is where she must remain. In 2010, Ingrid was arrested for using a social security number that, she later learned, belonged to someone else  —   she had purchased the documents years before from a man who told her not to pay taxes to avoid attracting the attention of the government. Ingrid paid the back taxes she owed and took a plea deal that spared her from jail time but required her to plead guilty to a felony. Her lawyer assured her the plea would have no effect on her immigration status. He was wrong. That felony conviction means that Latorre is currently a priority target for deportation. She plans to live at Mountain View, which as a house of worship is unlikely to be raided under current immigration policy, while she tries to reopen her criminal case and awaits a response from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on the stay of deportation application she filed on 25 November. On weekends, Bryant and Eliseo, Ingrid’s partner, live with Ingrid and Anibal on the second floor of the church. During the week, Eliseo and Bryant live at the family’s home, 15 miles away, visiting at night when they can. Since the election of Donald Trump last November, the ranks of the   sanctuary movement, which was launched in the face of the Obama administration’s aggressive deportation policies, have swelled. According to a recent tally by Church World Service, there are now more than 800 religious congregations in the United States that are engaged in the sanctuary movement (not all serve as hosting congregations) up from about 400  . “I think we’ll see that more and more congregations are going to try to create sanctuary spaces and try to stop these raids from happening,” says the Rev Noel Anderson, the Grassroots Coordinator for Immigrants’ Rights at Church World Service. “It’s very exciting to see how many people of faith are really called to action by the current climate. ” A few days later, a group of seven activists and volunteers from the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition gathered at Mountain View for an immigration action meeting. The men and women sat around folding tables in the house’s   main floor, eating pizza with Ingrid and Anibal. The mood was grim. Earlier in the day, Trump had signed a series of executive orders targeting immigrants. “Does anybody know how to withhold taxes in protest?” asked one attendee, an older woman with short hair wearing colorful glasses and a grey sweater set. Maureen Flanigan, a petite    with a neat bob of gray hair who is part of a Unitarian Universalist congregation in Denver, said she’d been engaging in “magical thinking” since the election. “I thought it wouldn’t happen,” she said, pulling her black puffer vest more closely around her and shaking her head. “And now it’s happening. And I just keep thinking about the people it directly affects, and I can’t stop thinking about that. ” The   sanctuary movement, which is inspired by the movement of the 1980s, is remarkable for the breadth of its support in a time of deep partisanship and division in this country. Congregations from Catholic, Quaker, Unitarian, Mormon, Jewish, Episcopalian and Methodist faiths have all joined. The Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition was founded back in 2014, just as the broader national movement was gaining strength, and comprises eight local religious congregations drawn from the Quaker, Unitarian and Catholic faiths. In 2014, the Coalition sheltered Arturo Hernández, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico with a family in the United States, for nine months at the First Unitarian Society of Denver. In addition to providing physical sanctuary, the Coalition also accompanies immigrants throughout their deportation and legal proceedings and advocates for more humane immigration policies. “This is a   response to a system that is inhumane and unjust and that harms people’s human and civil rights,” says Jennifer Piper, the interfaith organizer for Denver’s American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization that coordinates the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition. “Religiously, it doesn’t break down on the fault lines that you’d think. ” Congregations of different faiths cite different theological reasons for participating in the sanctuary movement. The Unitarian Universalist faith, for example, is guided by seven deeply held principles. “We have seven principles, and one is that we believe in the worth and dignity of every human being,” says Flanigan. “And we believe there are reasons that people immigrate and migrate, and these are usually economic, and so we support people who have to do that for a better life. ” The Quaker faith, meanwhile, is built on six testimonies, or values. “Our support for immigrants’ rights comes down to what we call our Quaker testimonies of equality, community and integrity,” David Poundstone, a member of the Mountain View congregation, explained to me. “We believe that everybody is equal, and that we are all together as people. And the integrity of the family is very important  —   just to see the harm that would come to children and parents to be separated. That’s enough to say this is the right thing for us to be doing. ” Noel Anderson, an ordained pastor in the United Church of Christ, points out that religious teachings around migrants are often consistent across the US’s dominant religions. “There is, across Abrahamic faith traditions at least, this dictate to welcome the stranger, for you were once a stranger in the land of Egypt,” Anderson says. “What are faith communities if not sanctuaries?”  At the January action meeting, the members of the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition discussed a variety of topics: the status of Ingrid’s case, fundraising strategies for her legal fees, and the cases of a number of other immigrants. The group discussed whether or not the city needs a more robust rapid response system, in case Ice starts aggressively conducted raids. Jennifer Pipe teared up as she briefed the group more thoroughly on the newly issued executive orders. Anibal, oblivious to the import of the conversation around him, rotated through the assembled volunteers, enticing them into playing with him. He tossed a teething toy on the floor and looked at Maureen Flanigan expectantly, grinning when she obligingly picked up the toy to hand back to him. As the meeting wound to a close, Piper told the group that she and Ingrid had been discussing whether their current strategy, which rests on having Ingrid’s felony conviction downgraded to a lesser charge due to the bad legal advice she received at the time, is still the best way to ensure the family stays together. “Will Ice still use discretion in cases with bad legal representation or hardship and suffering?” Piper asked, rhetorically. “I think we have to start asking those questions for all the folks we’re accompanying because the climate has changed so much. I think we need to start evaluating these cases in the context of the climate we have now, not the climate we had six months ago. ” ••• On 27 November 2016, the day before Ingrid and Anibal moved into Mountain View, Ingrid threw a birthday party for Anibal at the family’s home in Commerce City. She made food and a birthday cake, and friends and family came to celebrate. After the party, the family decorated a small, artificial Christmas tree. “Normally, we take Bryant to pick out a big real tree,” Latorre said. “But I knew I was leaving, and I didn’t know if I’d be back in time to clean it all up. But it would have been too sad for Bryant and Eliseo to be at home without a tree. ” As of this writing, Ingrid Latorre has been living in the Mountain View Friends Meeting for more than two months. The waiting is difficult. She waits to hear back from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, waits to hear from her lawyers, waits for Bryant and Eliseo to visit at night, and waits for the day when she can go back to her normal life.  She received word that she has been granted a hearing on 3 May on her request to have her criminal case reopened. It’s good news, but it raises a dilemma. Ingrid will have to attend the hearing in person. If she hasn’t received a response from Ice before then, or if Ice denies her application for a stay, leaving the safety of Mountain View will mean making herself vulnerable to deportation. The coalition is strategizing about how best to protect her on the drive to and from the courthouse. It’s not yet clear how the Trump administration will treat cases like Ingrid’s  —   several activists I spoke to say that the new executive orders, while full of bluster, don’t contain much in the way of substantive policy changes from the Obama years. But to Ingrid, the news coming out of Washington is dispiriting. “It’s really upsetting to see how quickly this president has been moving,” she told me. “And I don’t know what’s going to happen. My situation feels more difficult now. ”",-0.5
"UMass Students Freak Out over Journalist Being White, Wearing Cross. Journalist Mike Mahoney says a group of hostile students ganged up on him after Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ recent event at the University of Massachusetts, arguing over a litany of social justice   issues  —   peaking with one angry young woman allegedly charging at him. [According to Mahoney’s claims, prior to the event, he approached a crowd of around 20 protesters gathering outside of the auditorium prior to the event for question. According to his story, the protesters were generally friendly and polite as they discussed Islam, feminism, and political correctness. One protester even asked to take a photo with Mahoney before they entered the auditorium together to take their seats.  The event itself was chaotic, with a group of protesters consistently attempting to shout down the panelists  —   which included Yiannopoulos, former philosophy Professor Christina Hoff Sommers, and comedian Steven Crowder. The protesters hurled expletives at the panelists and told them that they weren’t welcome at UMass.  After the event’s conclusion and all attendees had left the auditorium, Mahoney claims that the protesters approached him with a much different attitude. Despite Mahoney leaving the event peacefully, by his account, he claims that one student protester repeatedly told him to “get the f*ck away from” him and that others gathered around him to challenge him for supporting the event which, at that point, had finished. Allegedly, a female protester attempted to charge through the crowd at Mahoney. When he asked her what why she was upset, he says she simply responded, “f*ck you. ” In response to the event’s discourse on Islam, one of the protesters challenged Mahoney about the cross around his neck and asked him if he considered violence committed during the Crusades to be reflective of Christianity. Because Mahoney is a white male, the protesters accused him of being responsible for the recent Charleston and Chapel Hill shootings. Before the protesters relented, one of them allegedly condemned Mahoney for the use of terms like “moderate Islam” and “extreme Islam” because “that use of language makes it sound like the religion is a disease. ” Tom Ciccotta writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

"A Casualty of ‘The Birth of a Nation’ Controversy Speaks Out - The New York Times. At Fox Searchlight’s holiday party in New York last week, the Bagger bumped into a couple of stars from two of the studio’s splashiest 2016 productions: one of the films soared to great heights, while the other crashed to an unimagined low. The first actor was Natalie Portman, who is raking in rave reviews for her performance in the title role in “Jackie” and is expecting her second child in a few months. The Bagger asked how she was faring on the awards circuit. “While pregnant and sober?” Ms. Portman dryly replied. The other actor was Colman Domingo, who played Hark in the slave revolt film “The Birth of a Nation,” which, for the first half of this year, before controversy engulfed it, was considered one of the brightest prospects for the awards season. He said now that the uproar had subsided, he wanted to share his frustrations and disappointments about how everything played out. “You walk into these rooms, and it’s almost like a bittersweet look people give you in their eyes,” Mr. Domingo said. “I look at the work of my peers on the film, and I wish it was being celebrated. The cinematography, the music. Aja Naomi King’s is one of the best performances of this year. But we’re under the veil of the whole controversy, and people almost don’t want to touch it. ” It is hard to overstate the ebullience that met “The Birth of a Nation” at its premiere at Sundance in January. “Birth,” which tells of the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in 1831, was the passion project of its director, writer and star, Nate Parker, who spent eight years pulling the financing together. The film arrived in Park City, Utah, just as Hollywood was fielding intense scrutiny for its   roster of Oscar acting nominees, and after a bidding war “Birth” sold to Fox Searchlight for $17. 5 million, a festival record. There were projections of awards, and while other films featuring black protagonists  —   “Moonlight,” “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Loving”  —   have come to dominate Oscar chatter, “Birth” was initially at the fore. “It felt like the film had an urgency,” Mr. Domingo said. Then, in the summer, after Oprah Winfrey and Spike Lee heartily endorsed the film, news articles emerged detailing harrowing rape accusations made in 1999 against Mr. Parker at Penn State, where he was a student and wrestler, and his roommate at the time, Jean McGianni Celestin (who would go on to share a story credit on the film). Mr. Parker was acquitted, and the case against the roommate, who was initially convicted, was reversed. After news broke that Mr. Parker’s accuser had killed herself in 2012, the scandal went nuclear. It all came to a head at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, when audiences responded to “Birth” with standing ovations. At a jammed news conference attended by every lead in the cast, including Mr. Domingo, Mr. Parker deflected a pointed question (asked by the Bagger). Few would doubt the importance of the film, the Bagger said, but people were having trouble separating the artist from the art. And since the film’s message was one of moral accountability, people felt Mr. Parker should offer his accuser’s family an apology. Would he now? Mr. Parker demurred, saying he was there to promote the film and celebrate the hundreds of people who made it. At that moment, Mr. Domingo, who had been sitting near Mr. Parker on the panel, said he felt the wind leave his sails. “That’s when I knew that the 45 minutes of the cast speaking in detail about the film would be eviscerated,” said Mr. Domingo, who is also a playwright and stars in television’s “Fear the Walking Dead. ” “I was disappointed,” he continued. “I would’ve handled it differently. Could he have handled it better? I don’t know what it’s like to walk in his shoes. I try to deal with things in a different way. I think I’m always trying to see the other’s point of view, dealing in a very    way. It’s    instead of   . But it’s possible he felt embattled by the time he got to Toronto. This was something he created with the spirit of love and community, and suddenly he’s battling other forces of something he dealt with 17 years ago. ” (Mr. Parker’s acquittal came in 2001.) Over all, Mr. Domingo believed that Mr. Parker, whom he described as “deeply passionate, generous and kind,” had handled the matter “the best way he can. ” Mr. Domingo also found fault with the Bagger’s question, a criticism others have echoed. “Looking back in hindsight, I can see Nate’s point of view. Why apologize when he was vindicated?” he asked. “But I believe with the media, you must answer every question in some way. And in very, very, touchy situations, we must answer every question again and again. Even if we’ve said it before, we have to say it again. ” His   shared his discomfort. Aunjanue Ellis, who played Nat Turner’s mother, wrote in Ebony that she “agonized” over how Mr. Parker handled the fallout from the accusations and that she grieved for the accuser and her family. Still, she urged people to see the film, as did the groundbreaking director Julie Dash, telling the Bagger, at the Toronto film festival: “No will always mean no. It will always be attached to that film. However, do not miss this experience of seeing that film. ” But people did miss seeing that film, in droves: according to Box Office Mojo, it has earned just $15. 8 million domestically. Its case was not helped by some middling reviews. But there is no question that the controversy dealt a death blow. (Mr. Parker’s representatives did not respond to questions for this article.) Looking back, Mr. Domingo said he felt there was “a huge takedown by any means necessary,” not just toward the film but also toward black resistance in America. After a summer, he said, of “dealing with black men on the streets and retaliation and Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, it’s almost as if this film was too powerful,” he said. “It was like a big slap on the hand: Never try this again. Who do you think you are? If this were ‘Madea’s Halloween,’ would they try to take it down? Absolutely not. ” While opinionators, including Damon Young of the digital magazine Very Smart Brothas, have dismissed the notion of a concerted takedown, it’s hard not to compare Mr. Parker’s scandal with that of Casey Affleck, the star of the current release “Manchester by the Sea. ” Mr. Affleck, who is white, faced sexual harassment complaints from two women  —   neither of whom would comment  —   and reached a settlement with them in 2010. Different circumstances, to be sure  —   “Birth” also prominently featured rapes, while “Manchester” is about a   family  —   but, still, the matter has not seemed to hurt Mr. Affleck’s Oscar chances this season. In the end, Mr. Domingo said, the controversy could be seen as a reflection of how he often sees his position in American culture. “I feel in many ways as a black man in this country, you should apologize, or feel gratitude,” he said. In recent days, Mr. Domingo said, he has discerned a shift around “Birth,” with more people being able to see it on its own merit. “This is one of the seminal moments in my career,” he said. “One of the moments I’m so proud of in every way. But you can’t feel proud of your work without the other feelings on top of it. ”",-1.0
"DOJ walks back guidance discouraging use of private prisons. Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice has rescinded guidance from August that discouraged the use of private prisons. ”This will restore (the Bureau of Prison’s) flexibility to manage the federal prison inmate population based on capacity needs,” the Justice Department said in a statement.  In August,   Attorney General Sally Yates directed the Bureau of Prisons to reduce its use of private prison contracts. In the August memo, she said private prisons had been used to house a prison population that had grown 800% between 1980 and 2013.  But, she said, the population is now on the decline, from 220, 000 in 2013 to 195, 000 in 2016. A DOJ official said on background Thursday that the BOP has 12 private prison contracts, housing approximately 21, 000 inmates. In a new memo dated February 21 and released for the first time on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote that the Yates memo ”changed   policy and practice, and impaired the bureau’s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.” He directed the bureau to ”return to its previous approach.” ”This will restore BOP’s flexibility to manage the federal prison inmate population based on capacity needs,” the Justice Department said in a statement Thursday.  New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker was quick to speak out against the change in policy. ”The Trump administration’s decision to reverse course on existing policies designed to gradually end the use of private prisons is a major setback to restoring justice to our criminal justice system,” Booker said in a statement. ”The Bureau of Prisons’ own inspector general has found that   prisons housing federal inmates are less safe and less secure than federal prisons, and these facilities have seen repeated instances of civil rights violations. Attaching a profit motive to imprisonment undermines the cause of justice and fairness.”",-1.0
"Dear Clinton supporters: Recount won’t matter .  (CNN) Donald Trump’s baseless assertion that there were ”millions of people who voted illegally,” and the Jill   recount in up to three states, both desecrate the beauty of our democracy, revered worldwide: that the winners humbly accept their victory and the losers graciously accept defeat. There is absolutely no evidence of widespread voter fraud, much less that there were millions of illegal voters. It diminishes the office of the presidency for the   to peddle these allegations. Although meaningless to the outcome, Trump lost the popular vote. Accusations of voter fraud or election tampering, with no evidence whatsoever, cause unnecessary frenzy and put the focus in a dangerous place: thinking we need to do something to cure election issues that do not exist.   Similarly, the recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are harmful because they make people believe something was amiss, with no evidence in support and no chance of changing the result.  News that Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has requested a recount in Wisconsin, and will likely do the same in Michigan and Pennsylvania, has raised faint hopes among Hillary Clinton supporters that somehow Donald Trump will not become the next president of the United States.  Now that Clinton’s campaign has said it will participate in the recount efforts, those supporters’ hopes have been lifted even higher. To put the matter bluntly: They should give up that hope. There is essentially zero chance that the recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will change Trump’s lead, which number in the thousands, not hundreds, in all three states. Trump is winning Wisconsin by a little more than 27, 000 votes his lead in Michigan sits at around 11, 000 and his lead in Pennsylvania is insurmountable at over 68, 000. This is not Florida 2000. On Election Night in 2000, George W. Bush held a 1, 784 vote lead over Al Gore in Florida’s election for president, representing just 0. 031 percent of the 5. 8 million votes cast in the state. After a recount    which the US Supreme Court halted by a   vote    Bush ultimately won Florida by 537 votes, securing the presidency. Yet even if the Court had allowed the recount to proceed, the margin would not have swung by much. This is not Washington 2004, where a recount reversed the result, handing Democrat Christine Gregoire a   win over Republican Dino Rossi after he initially had a   lead on election night. This is not Minnesota 2008, where a recount gave Democrat Al Franken a   win over Republican Norm Coleman, reversing Coleman’s initial lead of 215 votes. All of these recounts had one significant fact in common: the margin of victory was in the hundreds, not thousands. And the shifts in vote totals after the recounts were very small. In the past 15 years, a statewide recount has reversed the winner from the   tally only three times    in the Washington 2004 governor’s race (a   shift) the 2008 Minnesota US Senate race (a   shift) and a 2006 election in Vermont for Auditor of Accounts, which initially had a   margin on election night that changed to a   win for the other candidate after the recount (a   change). FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for electoral reform, found that from   there were only 22 statewide recounts across the country, and the average shift in those recounts was just 0. 026%. But, a Clinton supporter might say, what if the machines were hacked? What if the election was actually rigged? It is an ironic sentiment given that Trump was the one claiming widespread election rigging before the election and Clinton supporters blasted Trump for refusing to say whether he would honor the results.  Irony aside, there is simply no evidence of election hacking, as Clinton’s top lawyer, Marc Elias, himself conceded. Of course, now that Stein has begun the process, it is perfectly reasonable for Clinton and her lawyers to stay involved. But her supporters should not take that fact as a sign that the election is still in question. Prolonging the campaign by seeking a recount breeds unwarranted doubt about the legitimacy of our elections  —   without any real evidence to back it up. Our democratic system relies on everyone accepting the result. That legitimacy suffers when mere speculation calls the result into question with little evidence of rigging and Electoral College vote totals that decisively determine a winner. Moreover, all of this talk of recounts and election rigging obscures the more important fact about our elections: We impose too many obstacles on voters for no good reason. We need to work harder to eliminate onerous voting laws and make voting easier, not focus on   recounts that provide only false hope. For instance, this recount effort does nothing to address issues surrounding Wisconsin’s controversial voter ID statute, which improperly prevented some people from voting. While Stein’s futile recount effort should give no solace to Clinton supporters, there is a silver lining to the current debate: It might finally prompt Congress and state legislatures to devote greater resources to election technology. We desperately need better voting equipment and stronger   Day audits. Going into this election, experts warned about the woefully    equipment that most states use. Indeed, old machines    especially if they do not allow for a paper trail    raise the possibility, however small, of election hacking. Old machines can lead to long lines, lost votes, and other Election Day problems. Updated voting technology can increase turnout by making voting easier. As just one example, Doña Ana County, New Mexico uses Voting Convenience Centers instead of   polling places, meaning that anyone in the county can vote at any of the 40 centers instead of having to go to their assigned home precinct. This makes it easier to vote near work or school and eliminates the possibility of having to vote via a provisional ballot    which could potentially not count    if a voter shows up at the wrong place.  This system shows that improved technology can both enhance the integrity of our election system    a standard Republican talking point    and also make voting more accessible to more people, thereby increasing the electorate    something Democrats usually strive to achieve. The recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania will do nothing to assuage the fears of Clinton supporters who recoil at the thought of a Trump presidency. Trump’s dangerous allegation that there were millions of illegal voters similarly does nothing but stir up unnecessary controversy at a time when he should be working to bring the country together.  At a minimum, these activities should force politicians on all sides to   how we run our elections. Like it or not, Donald Trump will become our next president. Hopefully, when he runs for   in four years, we will have a stronger election system that makes voting easier, more convenient and accessible, less susceptible to manipulation, and more easily verifiable. That’s the closest to a ”win” that Clinton and her supporters can expect.",-1.0
"Report: Jared Kushner told CNN to fire 20% of its staff.

"Kerry to lay out vision for Israeli-Palestinian peace.  U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry will lay out his vision for ending the   conflict in a speech on Wednesday, days after the United States cleared the way for a U. N. resolution demanding an end to Israeli settlements. The speech, less than a month before President Barack Obama leaves office, is expected to be the administration’s last word on a   dispute that Kerry had hoped to resolve during his four years as America’s top diplomat. It could also be seen in Israel as another parting shot at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had an especially acrimonious relationship with Obama since they both took office in 2009. The United States on Friday broke with a longstanding approach of diplomatically shielding Israel and abstained on a United Nations Security Council resolution that passed with 14 countries in favor and none against. Kerry will discuss the abstention when he speaks at the State Department at 11 a. m. ET (1600 GMT) a senior State Department official told reporters.  ”We believe that with the   solution in peril, it is important to share the deeper understanding we have developed of both sides’ bottom lines during intensive consultations in recent years,” the official said. The speech will also address what the official called ”misleading” accusations by Israeli officials that the Obama administration drafted and forced the resolution to a vote. Undeterred by the U. N. resolution, Israel’s Jerusalem municipality is due to consider on Wednesday requests for construction permits for hundreds of new homes for Israelis in areas captured in 1967 and annexed to the city. ’SHAMEFUL’ DECISION, ISRAEL SAYS Israeli officials described the abstention as a ”shameful” decision.   Donald Trump, who urged the White House to veto the resolution, chided the world body as ”just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.”  State Department spokesman Mark Toner on Tuesday said the United States hoped the U. N. vote would serve as a ”  call” that settlements are a detriment to a   solution. Israel for decades has pursued a policy of building Jewish settlements on territory it captured in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Most countries view the settlements as an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing a biblical, historical and political connection to the land, as well as security interests. Washington considers the settlement activity illegitimate. Since learning last week of Kerry’s planned speech, Israeli  officials have been concerned he might use the address to lay out parameters for a Middle East peace deal. Netanyahu’s aides are confident the Trump administration will likely ignore any Obama principles and pay no heed to the U. N. resolution, but they fear Kerry’s remarks will put Israel on the defensive and prompt other countries to apply pressure. Kerry previously failed to bring about a diplomatic resolution to the conflict in talks that froze in 2014. U. S. officials left little doubt they put much of the blame on Netanyahu’s stance on settlements. Some 570, 000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem among more than 2. 6 million Palestinians.  (Writing by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Howard Goller) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

" Apple Sets New App Store Record With $3 Billion In December Sales. ’Watch Shigeru Miyamoto Play Super Mario Run   (While Eating Cake)’] The winter holidays proved to be another season of milestones for Apple’s App Store. Apple on Thursday said App Store purchases topped a   $3 billion for the month of December* culminating in a New Year’s Day spike that saw customers spend nearly $240 million in a single day. And this too was a new record the App Store’s prior biggest sales day ever was Jan. 1, 2016, when customers spent more than $144 million. In a news release, Apple  —   which takes a 30% cut of app sales through the App Store  —   said developers earned some $20 billion in 2016, up 40% from 2015. That’s a third of the $60 billion they’ve earned since the store first opened in 2008. The company attributed a portion of this uptick to   subscriptions, which now span more than 20, 000 apps, including Netflix, HBO Now, and MLB. com At Bat. App Store customers spent $2. 7 billion on   subscriptions in 2016, up 74% from 2015, Apple said. The company takes a 30% cut of any monthly charges when a new user signs up within an iOS app. But after 12 months, that fee drops to 15%. According to app store analytics company App Annie, Google Play’s worldwide downloads were 115 percent higher than Apple’s App Store downloads in the third quarter of 2016 (the latest data available). That said, App Store revenue was 100 percent higher than Google Play revenue in that same quarter. By 2016’s end, the App Store offered some 2. 2 million apps in total, up over 20% from 2015. For the year, Pokémon Go was the   app among them. But Super Mario Run became the   app in App Store history when it debuted on Dec. 15, with 40 million downloads in four days. Neither Apple nor Nintendo, the app’s developer, have disclosed how many people have made the Mario Run leap from free to freemium with the game’s $10   purchase. * While Apple did not break out App Store sales for December 2015 in its last holiday sales roundup, it did say that “customers spent over $1. 1 billion on apps and   purchases during the two weeks ending January 3. ”  ",-1.0
"Tech entrepreneur running for Congress in Michigan. Suneel Gupta, a former Groupon exec who later founded mobile health app maker Rise Labs (sold to One Medical last year), has announced that he is running for Congress in Michigan's 11th district. Why it matters: Gupta says he's the first tech entrepreneur to run for Congress in a Rust Belt state. He's also married to tech journalist Leena Rao, best known from her time at Fortune and TechCrunch, and is the younger brother of CNN doc Sanjay Gupta. Ballot basics: He's a Democrat and will have to navigate a crowded primary field, but it's an open seat as current Rep. Dave Trott (R) has decided not to run for reelection. Bio pitch: Gupta was born and raised in the district, before eventually leaving for Silicon Valley. He says his mother was a refugee from India who ""walked into Ford Motor Company, asked for a job and was hired as its first-ever female engineer."" Both of his parents, however, experienced being laid off from their auto sector jobs on the same day in 2001. Political pull: Gupta and Rise Labs worked with Michelle Obama on her obesity and healthcare initiatives, ultimately forming a sort of public-private partnership between the startup and The White House. He later would be part of the Hillary Clinton transition team — charged with staffing the Office of Science and Technology — but obviously that was a short-lived post.",0.0
"Source: Airstrike targeted Mokhtar Belmokhtar in Libya.  (CNN) U. S. planes carried out a strike inside Libya on Sunday, reportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa, U. S. and Libyan officials said.  The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter, who is blind in one eye, affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U. S. official told CNN.  The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the strike, something that U. S. officials have not confirmed.  Federal prosecutors in New York had charged Belmokhtar in 2013 with crimes related to a brazen attack on a gas facility in Algeria were 37 hostages died. Three Americans were among the dead.  Two   fighter jets dropped multiple   bombs on a hardened structure in the center of a compound, multiple U. S. defense officials told CNN.  U. S. aerial intelligence assets were tracking Belmokhtar’s movements at the time of the raid, a Pentagon official with direct knowledge of the operation told CNN, but the outcome of the operation was still being assessed.  The initial indication was that Belmokhtar had been killed, the U. S. officials said, but they still lacked an absolute confirmation.  The Libyan government went further in a statement Sunday, saying that the U. S. airstrike ”led to the killing of Moktar Belmokhtar and a group of Libyans who are members of a terrorist organization in Eastern Libya.” The strike happened at 2 a. m. Sunday (8 p. m. ET Saturday). In New York, Belmokhtar was charged on various conspiracy counts including   kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. The    Battalion, Belmokhtar is the founder of the    Battalion, also known as the   Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for the January 2013 attack in Algeria. In the Algerian siege, heavily armed militants in pickups struck a sprawling   natural gas complex near In Amenas, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. Belmokhtar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. The Algerian military tried to negotiate with the militants during the standoff, but their demands to release militants held prisoner in Algeria were deemed unreasonable, leading to intervention by special forces troops. The gas facility operated in cooperation with foreign energy firms such as Norway’s Statoil and Britain’s BP    and as such, employed workers from several Western countries.",-1.0

The investment will provide the start-up with the money it needs to expand into more markets across the U.S. In addition, Audi of America President Scott Keogh will join Silvercar's board of directors, and the rental company will team up with Audi to develop a car-share program for businesses. ""Silvercar represents not just the future of the rental industry, but a vision for the future of mobility,"" Keogh said. ""We want to utilize the company's strengths in technology and innovation to merge connectivity and mobility for today's consumer."" The partnership between Silvercar and Audi, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, is the latest sign of traditional auto brands looking for new ways to grow their business. More importantly, the companies' commitment to developing car-sharing programs for corporate campuses signals the growing attention automakers are placing on alternative transportation plans.

"Egypt imposes big security clampdown, protests fail to materialize.  Egypt imposed a big security clampdown in its cities on Friday as mass demonstrations called to protest against austerity measures failed to take place. Riot police and armored vehicles filled the otherwise empty streets of central Cairo, but most people stayed at home.  President Abdel Fattah   has urged Egyptians not to protest and warned that there would be no going back on economic reforms, no matter how much pain they might cause.  In a boost for the government, the International Monetary Fund’s executive board approved a   $12 billion loan to Egypt aimed at supporting the reforms, and the central bank said it received a first tranche of $2. 75 billion. A   group calling itself Movement of the Poor had called for Egyptians to protest on Nov. 11 against deepening austerity measures the government says are required to save the Arab world’s most populous nation from financial ruin. But big protests failed to materialize across the country by 8:30 p. m (1830 GMT). Police dispersed several small gatherings and there were some minor clashes. No one was killed or injured. ”The Egyptian people chose stability and development and rejected any calls against that,” state television quoted Prime Minister Sherif Ismail as saying. The calls to protest began in August, but gained traction on social media last week after Egypt raised fuel prices and floated its currency   a move welcomed by bankers but condemned by ordinary people as the latest blow to their diminishing spending power. The usually busy Tahrir Square was deserted except for armored vehicles with   launchers and dozens of riot police. Authorities shut down the Sadat metro station to prevent potential demonstrators reaching the square, which has in the past been a center of political protest.  ”I don’t think anything will happen but this security presence scares people and ensures nothing does,” said Shenouda Ishak, a driver in the Cairo district of Shubra.  ”SCARES PEOPLE” There was a heavy security presence in other areas of Cairo, and other cities including Alexandria, Suez, and Minya. The protests won little support from prominent activist and opposition groups, though they have been backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.  But in a country where street politics helped to unseat two presidents within two years, authorities were keen to deter protesters. Dozens of people were detained in recent weeks, accused of inciting unrest. Protesters camped in Tahrir Square in an   demonstration that ended Hosni Mubarak’s   rule in 2011. When Egyptians took to the streets in   to end a year of Brotherhood rule,    Sisi intervened.  Security sources said police chased dozens of protesters away from Arbaeen Square in Suez, near the place where the first protester was killed in 2011. Protesters on Friday chanted against high prices. In the coastal province of Beheira, police fired tear gas at protesters who threw rocks back. Security sources said 98 suspected Brotherhood supporters were arrested in three cities in Beheira, 14 in Alexandria, and 10 in Suez. Muslim Brotherhood activists held a limited protest in the hometown of former President Mohamed Mursi but did not clash with police. SISI CRUSHED DISSENT Many ordinary Egyptians and activists believe the heyday of street politics is over. After taking power, Sisi crushed dissent and has applied a protest law so strictly that few dare to come out, despite rising public anger. State media reported police surrounded the entrances of Cairo and other cities to ensure that members of the Muslim Brotherhood did not enter.  The interior ministry said on Thursday that it confiscated a cache of arms and ammunition hidden in a graveyard and house by the Brotherhood in Fayoum province, southwest of Cairo. The ministry also said it raided five bomb factories around the country on Wednesday, accusing a militant group of coordinating with the Muslim Brotherhood to attack police checkpoints on the eve of the protests. Stung by street revolts that have made life worse rather than better, many people said they would stay at home. Reuters spoke to five activists who all said protests would achieve little and feared violence if they did materialize. ”The revolutionary bloc is reticent to protest. We now know that any street action leads to bloodshed. There is no result we can achieve with this regime,” said Malek Adly, a human rights lawyer with the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights. Sisi came to power promising economic reform and stability but problems have piled up. With a budget deficit of 12 percent and a looming funding gap, Egypt reached a preliminary deal with the IMF for the $12 billion loan in August this year. TAX RISES, FOOD PRICES BITE HARD Yet Egyptians feel hit by tax rises, soaring food price inflation and cuts in state subsidies. Core inflation is almost at    over 15 percent, as a foreign exchange shortage and a rise in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars. Egypt raised electricity prices by 25 to 40 percent and introduced a 13 percent   tax in August.  The government has tried to win public support for the austerity measures with a billboard campaign and media blitz and also sought to expand social security schemes to shield the poorest from the effects of the rising prices. But many Egyptians who would not qualify for such schemes complain they can no longer afford meat, while sugar shortages have driven fears of an impending food crisis. In his speeches, Sisi has sought to persuade Egyptians that a collective sacrifice is necessary to save the country from financial ruin. But he also warned that the army could be deployed across the country within six hours in the event of street unrest.  (Additional reporting by Mohamed Abdellah, Omar Fahmy, and Mostafa Hashem; Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Pravin Char) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

"Town Instructed to Remove ’Christian Values’ Road Sign. A town in northern Italy has been instructed to remove a road sign proclaiming its Christian values as it breaches the highway code. [Pontoglio, a small town of 7, 000 residents in the   Italian region of Lombardy, put up the new sign below its official town marker. It set out for visitors and newcomers the exact standards of behaviour expected of them, as Breitbart London previously reported.  Now the Prefect of Brescia, Valerio Valenti, has told mayor Alessandro Seghezzi to scrap the controversial new signs claiming that they don’t comply with the highway code. The offending signs are ‘brick’ coloured, which on Italian roads signify a local tourist attraction. No such venue is being advertised in this case, and therefore the town risks being fined for displaying them, reports Italian newspaper Giornale di Brescia. The road sign reads: “Pontoglio, town of western culture and profound Christian tradition. Those not intending to respect this culture and local traditions will be invited to leave. ” The sign, which was put up with the blessing of the local council, is not explicitly aimed at any group but was nevertheless referred to locally as the “no Islam sign”.   Mayor Seghezzi explained his motivations for the sign in a letter in which he wrote it represented: “  …    an invitation to respect the culture and traditions. A culture that is based on mutual respect: from the woman to music, from the costumes, from customs to the traditional rites. Respect for others, is for us, the first real form of civilisation and liberty. ” The Brescian branch of the General Investigations and Special Operations Division  —   the Italian law enforcement agency which investigates terrorism, organised crime and serious offences like kidnapping and extortion  —   has reported the matter to the local prosecutor who is said to be considering if any criminal offence has been committed.",1.0
"Syria sees its deadliest day in 3 years. 127 people were killed on Monday in Eastern Ghouta from pro-government strikes, resulting in the ""heaviest one-day death toll"" the country has seen in three years, per Reuters.

The ""extreme escalation"" in the conflict prompted the United Nations to call for an immediate ceasefire as it said the region was ""spiraling out of control."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said of those killed, more than 30 were children and women.

"Michelin stars awarded to two Singapore hawker stalls. Forget handing over half a wage-packet for fine dining - in Singapore food fans can now experience Michelin-starred cuisine in the street. Two Singaporean street food, or hawker, stalls were awarded a Michelin star on Thursday, a first for Michelin, whose coveted awards generally conjure up an image of posh establishments with dress codes and stiff-backed waiters. Instead, the hawker stalls - Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle at Crawford Lane and Chinatown's Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle - are in so-called ""food centers"" with shared dining spaces and no air conditioning to combat Singapore's sweltering heat. Hawker stalls usually sell local favorites such as chicken rice, char kway teow (fried flat noodles), rojak (mixed fruit salad with prawn paste), laksa and chendol (coconut milk with palm sugar syrup, kidney beans and grass jelly) and ice kacang (shaved ice with sweet syrup, sweet corn and fruit), usually for just a few dollars per meal. A day after winning his Michelin star, Tang Chay Seng, the owner and chef at Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, told CNBC, ""There was a queue even before I opened my stall at 9:30 a.m.!"" ""I was very happy to win the award. Why did they pick me? I don't know. I've heard of Michelin before but didn't think it would have anything to do with my hawker business,"" he said. Chan Hon Meng, the owner and chef at Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle, was too busy to talk on Friday afternoon, as he worked furiously to cater for a 40-strong queue of customers waiting for his signature dish. ""Singapore is a real crossroads of trade and commerce, with multiple culinary influences and a repertoire that is enjoyed by both locals and visitors,"" Michael Ellis, international director of the Michelin Guides, said in a press release to announce the hawker stalls' stars. ""Here's where our inspectors have discovered real jewels,"" he added. The island nation is the fourth Asian country, after Macau, Hong Kong and Japan, to be rated by the Michelin Guide, which is a prestigious annually-published guide book by French tire company Michelin. Michelin's one-star award is given to restaurants that offer ""high-quality cooking, worth a stop,"" according to the guide; two-stars are awarded for ""excellent cooking, worth a detour,"" and three stars are reserved for ""exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey."" Earlier in July, the Singapore Michelin Guide had awarded the Bib Gourmand to 34 hawker stalls. The Bib Gourmand is another award under the Michelin system that is given to dining establishments that offer ""exceptional good food at moderate prices,"" which for Singapore is under S$45 ($33.20), according to Michelin.

"The Warriors are wrecking the Cavaliers’ finals ... and maybe their future too. Twelve days ago the Golden State Warriors were down two games in the conference finals. Their chances of winning the series looked bleak, but the overwhelming consensus was that if any team could come back from a   deficit, it would be the historic   Warriors, the NBA’s defending champs. On Monday, the Cavaliers find themselves in a similar position trailing   in the NBA finals and not playing their best basketball. Only it seems hard to find a single soul alive who believes they can beat the Warriors. In fact, in the wake of two dominating performances by the Warriors that saw Golden State outscore Cleveland by a combined 48 points, it’s difficult to even come up with a scenario that gives the Cavaliers the series as part of a fanciful thought exercise. A Cleveland championship is a sports unicorn. George RR Martin could use all of his fantasy powers and probably only get this series to six games.  “They just beat us at every . .. we didn’t win anything,” LeBron James after Game 2. “No points of the game did we beat them in anything. Even when we had an early lead. ” LeBron looks to be close to losing a fifth NBA finals, but he’s clearly a   analyst because there are truly zero positives to draw from the Cavs’ trip to Oakland, maybe short of reminding fans that Richard Jefferson still plays in the NBA and can be a solid contributor offensively.  The 35   Jefferson had 12 points and five rebounds in Game 2 after being forced into additional minutes when Kevin Love left the game due to concussion symptoms. Love was supposed to team with Kyrie Irving to give Cleveland a legitimate shot to erase the memory of last year’s finals when LeBron had to take on the Warriors alone. But that shorthanded Cavaliers team looks superior to the one getting embarrassed now.  Love was just    from the floor in the game before exiting and is    in the series overall. His defense has been subpar, as well. Irving has been no better, hitting on just 33% of the 36 shots he’s hurled at the rim so far and providing five assists. Total. In two games. As a point guard. LeBron opened the series hoping to get help from his sidekicks and play a team game, but with Love and Irving MIA, he’s been forced to repeatedly take the ball to the rim where he’s been swarmed by Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green and anyone and everyone else on the Warriors, resulting in a series leading 11 turnovers. His 19 points in Game 2 were the fewest James scored in any game in the 2016 playoffs.  “I’m not disappointed in our guys or frustrated, we’ve just got to do a better job,” said James after the defeat. OK, but the terrifying fact remains for the Cavaliers that the Warriors can also do a better job. Cleveland’s struggles and the blowout margins in Games 1 and 2 conceal the fact that Steph Curry and Klay Thompson haven’t even been near their best scoring the ball. They haven’t much needed to with the Warriors playing a beautiful team game on the offensive end with ball movement and spacing that has seen Green, Barnes, Leandro Barbosa and Shaun Livingston all take turns picking up the scoring slack.  Golden State’s offense has been such a sight to behold that JR Smith has spent most of his time on the defensive end just standing and watching. Yet Thompson has just 26 points in the series and Curry 29, a point below his per game average in the regular season. Sure, LeBron, Love and Irving could all suddenly raise their level of play, but what if Curry and Thompson do, too? How do LeBron and company possibly bridge the   gap?  The Cavaliers turning it all around in time for Game 3 Thursday night seems a monumental task. Maybe they steal one in Cleveland behind the energy of the home crowd  —   assuming the Cleveland fans still have energy and haven’t already given up, and who could blame them after decades of disappointment?  —   but beating the Warriors four out of five? Unicorns.  “I just thought when they went to the small   their small   was a lot faster than what ours was,” Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue said after Game 2. “Being faster and being longer and athletic gave us some trouble. It gave us some problems. We have to figure that   out. ” That   and much more. It’s impossible to see where Cleveland gets the answers against a team that dating back to last year’s finals has now beaten them seven games in a row and by a combined score of  . Well, short of acquiring Steven Adams, Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant before Thursday night.  And that brings us to free agency. The destruction of the Cavaliers has been so thorough and convincing through two games  —   or their last seven against the Warriors, if you prefer  —   that there will be serious discussion if LeBron decides to stay on after this season concludes. The plan was to make a triumphant return to Cleveland and deliver a championship, yet less than two full years in it’s looking like a hopeless endeavor. The Cavaliers are in   mode, but simply aren’t and don’t appear capable of doing so. A year ago the Warriors arrived seemingly out of nowhere to steal the King’s crown and they remain better and, even worse, younger.  If Irving and Love aren’t enough to help LeBron beat Golden State this year, there’s zero reason to believe they will be next year or the year after. James could decide to remain in Cleveland, but barring a massive roster overhaul, it would have the feel of choosing loyalty over chasing championships. It would mark the beginning of the final stage of LeBron’s career, an   great player winding down his career in his hometown on an   team.  Even George RR Martin would struggle to pen a demise that bleak. ",-0.5
"Trump believes millions voted illegally, WH says -- but provides no proof. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump believes millions of votes were cast illegally in last year’s election, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday, but he wouldn’t provide any concrete evidence for the claim, which has long been debunked. ”The President does believe that, I think he’s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him,” Spicer said. Pressed for what evidence exists, Spicer would say only that Trump ”has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has.” When pushed about whether Trump will call for an investigation into the voter fraud, Spicer said, ”maybe we will.” Trump surprised the top Republicans and Democrats in Congress on Monday when, during a dinner at the White House, he repeated his claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton    allegedly depriving him of the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes in November, but won the Electoral College and thus the presidency. Trump, however, has seemingly been fixated on the popular vote, tweeting after the election in November that, ”In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” A number of studies have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. The Truth About Voter Fraud, a report written by experts at The Brennan Center for Justice, found voter fraud rates were between 0. 00004% and 0. 0009%. ”Given this tiny incident rate for voter impersonation fraud, it is more likely that an American will be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls,” reads the report. Trump’s lawyers    in an objection to Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s Michigan recount petition    have also argued that there was no evidence voter fraud in the 2016 election. ”All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake,” the lawyers wrote in a filing.  South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham slammed Trump earlier Tuesday over the claim. ”I wasn’t there, but if the President of the United States is claiming that 3. 5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy  —   he needs to disclose why he believes that,” Graham told CNN. Spicer said Tuesday that Trump believes in widespread voter fraud, in part, because of a study that found 14% of people who voted were  . Spicer did not say expressly which study Trump has read, but a 2014 study by Jesse Richman and David Earnest found more than 14% of   in 2008 and 2010 ”indicated that they were registered to vote.” The authors wrote, in a Washington Post opinion piece, the report showed ”that 6. 4 percent of   voted in 2008 and 2. 2 percent of   voted in 2010.” The study was designed by Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and in 2014 the group said their sample was so small that it could be incorrect and attributable to normal survey error and not   saying that they are registered to vote. Trump’s campaign cited in October a 2012 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts entitled ”Inaccurate, Costly and Inefficient: Evidence that American Voter Registration Systems Needs an Upgrade” as backup for that claim. The study found that ”about 24 million voter registrations are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate” and ”more than 1. 8 million dead people are listed as voters.” The study, which is based on 2011 data, is about the need to update voter rolls and underscores deficiencies in the voter registration system, but does not show that people who have registrations in two states are voting twice for Democrats or for Republicans. David Becker, the primary author of the Pew Report, tweeted in November, ”We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.”",-1.0

"Nigeria: Muslim Mob Beheads Woman in Public Market for Insulting Muhammad - Breitbart. A woman local reports have identified only as Bridget was beheaded by an angry Muslim mob in a busy market in Nigeria’s Kano state Thursday after she allegedly blasphemed against Muhammad during a dispute with a customer. [Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper, one of the nation’s largest, provides few details on the incident, little more than the fact that it occurred. The report identifies the location of the incident as the Kofar Wambai market in northern Kano state, “when the activities at the textile hits it’s [sic] peak. ” It does not state what the woman said to incur the wrath of the mob, other than the fact that it is believed she committed “blasphemy. ”  Nigeria Today identifies the woman as “Bridget,” a plastic seller in the market, while not describing the mode of her murder outside of having her throat slit in front of her husband. This report also accuses her of “blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed” in the context of a dispute with someone else in the market. The attackers, the report notes, were “some youths armed with dangerous weapons. ” Nigeria Today reports that the head of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called for an emergency meeting to discuss the incident and how to prevent similar attacks, though the report does not confirm whether Bridget herself was Christian or merely referred to Muhammad incorrectly in the heat of the moment. The incident occurs as Nigeria struggles to curb the violent tendencies of a number of its Muslims groups, most famously the Islamic   terrorist insurgency Boko Haram and the rural menace of the Fulani herdsmen, who have been massacring Christians for decades in order to steal their land. In Kano, the Muslim Emir has called for moderate adaptations of some Islamic legal codes as a response to the immense poverty that many in Nigeria suffer. Specifically, Emir Muhammad Sanusi is advocating for Nigeria to ban marriages where one or both of the participants are under 18, noting that young marriages typically lead to large families and increased poverty. While he did not challenge the morality of marrying a minor, he noted that the practical aspects of pushing families run by minors into the Nigerian economy can no longer be ignored: “Unfortunately our people do not change and somebody with virtually nothing still give birth to 20 or 30 children and this must stop. ” Child marriages have become a growing problem under Boko Haram’s reign of terror, as the group expressly conducts mass kidnappings of girls to be married off to jihadists and forced to cook and serve as sex slaves for their new owners. The Nigerian government has for months claimed, however, that Boko Haram has been reduced to a minor threat, with President Muhammadu Buhari claiming in December that Nigeria “has won the war” against Boko Haram. Boko Haram is still extremely active in northern Nigeria, particularly in Borno state, where it has its headquarters. The Nigerian military nonetheless continues to arrest dozens of jihadists in raids of the Sambisa forest. This week, military officials confirmed the arrest of 77 Boko Haram jihadists who surrendered upon being confronted. The raid also liberated 345 captives who must now pass security screenings to ensure they have not been brainwashed into attacking Christians or Nigerian soldiers. The Nigerian government is also working to confront the Fulani herdsmen, who have taken control of large swathes of land in the center of the country and are threatening to invade the Christian south. While the Fulani herdsmen have been targeting and mass executing Christians for decades, pleas for more help from Buhari’s government have escalated has they have made their way south to Benue state, stealing Christian land and killing villagers with guns and machetes. The Global Terrorism Index reported a marked increase in Fulani herdsmen attacks on Christians in 2014, the latest year in which statistics are available, having killed over 1, 000 more people that year than in 2013.",1.0
"Supreme Court Declines To Reinstate North Carolina Voter Restrictions. A divided U. S. Supreme Court refused Wednesday to reinstate a set of voter restrictions enacted by the   Legislature in the battleground state of North Carolina. Last month a federal appeals court invalidated the restrictions, declaring that they were deliberately targeted at making it more difficult for   to vote. The restrictions were enacted in 2013 shortly after the U. S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. That provision, until then, had required areas with a history of discrimination in voting to   any changes in voting laws with the Justice Department or the federal courts. Once freed from that obligation, North Carolina, as well as other states, began enacting laws that minorities said were deliberately aimed at making it harder for them to vote. In the Tarheel State the restrictions ranged from strict requirements for photo IDs at the polls to the partial elimination of early voting and elimination of   registration. In July, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out those restrictions as intentionally discriminatory. The court noted that the   Legislature had drafted the law after receiving data showing that   would be the most disadvantaged by the new rules. Republican Gov. Pat McCrory then appealed to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to restore the law for the November election. Late Wednesday, the Supreme Court refused to do that, with the justices split, for the most part,    and the court’s most conservative justices falling one vote shy of the five votes it takes to block a lower court decision. The court has been operating without a full complement of nine justices since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February and the refusal of the   Senate to consider President Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to replace him.",-0.5
"Business Of Disaster: Insurance Firms Profited $400 Million After Sandy. This story is Part 1 of a   series. See our second piece about local recovery programs that are struggling to help homeowners here. On a cold rainy day last fall, dozens of people gathered in a plaza across the street from New Jersey’s state Capitol. They held press conferences and slept overnight in lawn chairs. Everyone had come to make the same point: They’d made it through Superstorm Sandy, which hit the shores of New Jersey and New York in October 2012. But three years later, many hadn’t made it home. Doug Quinn, a    from Toms River, N. J. had been in the plaza for two days. ”I should be at home in my house and part of my community and instead I’m here doing this,” said Quinn. ”I thought it’ll be all right my insurance will take care of what needs to be taken care of and I’ll be back home in three to four months. It’s [been] three years and I’m still not anywhere close. I look back now and think how naive I was.” Superstorm Sandy wasn’t a disaster for everyone, though. For some, it was big money. NPR and the PBS series Frontline have spent the past year investigating the business of disaster and have uncovered a complex system in which private companies profit and homeowners and clients suffer. At the center of that system is the National Flood Insurance Program, which is designed to help in disasters like Sandy. Almost everyone with a mortgage who lives near water pays for flood insurance through the program, so more than three years later most residents expected to be home. But in many cases that didn’t happen. While thousands of homeowners like Quinn said they have not received the recovery help they need, our investigation found that their private insurance companies that administer the government’s flood program made as much as an estimated $240 million to $406 million in profit annually over the past four years. We reached out to flood insurers  —   including some of the nation’s largest firms  —   that represent the majority of homeowners affected by the storm and all declined to comment on this story. Records show that nearly 80 firms participate in the government’s flood program. Robert Hartwig, head of an industry group funded by the insurance companies, said insurance companies price their services to make a reasonable profit, like any business. ”It is always going to be the case  —   in the event of a major catastrophic loss where hundreds of thousands of people will have seen damage or complete destruction of their property  —   in some instances that they will believe they are due more than in fact the claim was ultimately adjusted for,” he said. ”This is a    operation,” said Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute. ”The federal government determines what the appropriate payment is.” Still, FEMA’s top flood official acknowledged that the program needs fixing and told NPR and Frontline that he is pursuing reforms. Government auditors asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency seven years ago to impose stricter oversight of the program, including insurers’ profit margins. But little has been done. ”What I can tell you is that I am focused on those policyholders and insuring that they get the resources and the payouts they are entitled to,” said Roy Wright, who runs FEMA’s flood program. He acknowledged that the program does not provide enough oversight of the firms. ”Because when I go back and look, while we were providing oversight, it was not enough.” And after our reporting, FEMA announced Monday it will include more transparency in and oversight of the National Flood Insurance Program. That includes overhauling its contracts with private insurance companies and assigning a person to help policyholders through an appeals process. ’The Game Was Stacked Against Us’ To understand the challenges homeowners are facing, we set out for Toms River, N. J. where Quinn’s house used to be. The night of the storm, a wall of water surged across his lot, swamping Quinn’s foundation and most of his first floor. State officials said his house had to come down, so he had it razed. Quinn had the maximum flood insurance policy  —   $250, 000 in coverage. But when the letter arrived from the insurance company, he didn’t get $250, 000. He got $90, 000. That wasn’t enough to rebuild his home. Now, more than three years later, he is still paying the mortgage on this nonexistent home while he rents the house he lives in now. ”I knew right off the bat that something was wrong,” he says. ”I did not realize that the game was stacked against us and there really was no way to win.” If it was a game, he wasn’t the only player. Thousands of homeowners across New York and New Jersey were underpaid. Some got just a fraction of their policies. FEMA runs the government flood program. But it doesn’t write the policies or manage the claims. It pays private insurance companies fees to do that work. When homeowners buy flood insurance, they pay a fee that doesn’t actually stay with the insurance company. It goes into a pot of money to the flood program. After a disaster, the insurance companies that participate in the flood program decide how much a homeowner will receive. They then pay homeowners using the pot from the program. When that money runs out, as it has during big disasters in recent years, taxpayers pay the rest. In theory, homeowners shouldn’t be shortchanged because the insurance companies are only acting as a middleman between FEMA and the homeowners making claims, essentially contracting with the government to evaluate damage and assess compensation. And yet in the months and years after Superstorm Sandy, hundreds of homeowners in New York and New Jersey filed lawsuits claiming that not only were they shortchanged by their flood insurance, but they were cheated. ’A Noticeable Sea Change’ In Insurer Attitudes, David Charles, an insurance adjuster who represents homeowners, says he had always loved his job and never had any problems with insurance companies. But after Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts in 2005  —   and became the most costly storm in U. S. history  —   things changed. ”There was so much money spent on Katrina, the insurance companies paid out so much that there was a noticeable sea change in the attitude of the insurance companies going forward,” he says. ”My files started coming back to me. Take this out, take that out. Every single change they made reduced the cost.” Charles says he was seeing cutbacks, no matter which insurance company he was working for. He says other adjusters shared similar stories. The insurance industry says homeowners have not been systematically underpaid. ”There is no incentive for a private insurer at all to underpay these claims,” says Hartwig, the insurance institute’s president. ”The vast majority of those individuals who in fact did have coverage are happy with their insurance companies and they’re happy with the way the process unfolded for them.” Dozens of homeowners we interviewed described something different. So did several others who worked closely with the insurance companies after the storm. Jeff Coolidge reviewed adjusters’ files for multiple insurance companies after Superstorm Sandy. He says he quit his job in part because he was so bothered by what he was doing. The insurance firms he worked for used phrases like ”” ”earth movement” or ”ground settlement” to reject homeowners’ claims of flood damage. ”They use ’settlement’ a lot. ’Sorry your house looks like it shifted to the left a little bit, but I think it was like that when you bought it,’ ” Coolidge said. They told him to pay homeowners less than what they asked to be paid to rebuild, he said. He says that put pressure on him to get the independent adjusters in the field in line to back up these conclusions, or else their flat fee was at stake. ”I’ve told an adjuster that based on our guidelines that I need you to remove these items,” he says. ”I send it back for revision. He doesn’t agree with that. He’ll resubmit it. I’ll reject it back.” If the adjuster wanted to pay the homeowner more, Coolidge would reject the adjuster’s assessment until he got the answer his employer wanted, and in some cases he switched adjusters or threatened to do so. ”’I’m going to take half your pay and give it to him,” he recalls telling several adjusters. Looking back, Coolidge says he regrets that behavior but at the time, he didn’t feel he had a choice. ”I feel bad every day for participating in that. It is what it is. [The insurance companies] had the upper hand. You either do it or they’ll remove you.” Running Deficits Since The Beginning, Part of the reason insurance companies could have been shorting homeowners through people like Coolidge may lie in the way the program was set up  —   and how much it is paying insurance companies. Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program in the 1960s when large storms swept across the Midwest, wiping out entire towns. ”The idea of the original program was brilliant,” says Robert Hunter, who ran the flood program in the 1970s. ”The program would become less and less expensive because people would be building safer and safer structures and . .. the program would become   and carry its own weight and not lose money.” But that has never happened. The program has run deficits from the beginning. In the 1980s it was $700 million in debt. In the 1990s, it was $1 billion in debt. And today, after Katrina and Sandy, the program is $23 billion in the red. Hunter says that’s partly because the program doesn’t charge homeowners enough in premiums to adequately fund itself. But, he says, it’s also because FEMA pays the private insurance companies too much money. At least a third of the money that homeowners put into the program gets paid to them, he says. Last year, government data show, that came to more than $1 billion in fees. Hunter says with so much money going to insurance companies, it’s that much harder to cover storm losses, or save up to help pay for the really big ones, like Katrina or Sandy. ”In the long run you’re going to lose money,” he says. ”And you’re going to lose a lot of money, and that’s what happening.” Now, when a big storm hits, taxpayers mostly pick up the tab, and the insurance companies get paid, regardless. ”It’s a sweetheart deal” for flood insurance firms, Hunter says. ”[The companies] like it. They have no risk. It’s just doing what they normally do they just tack it onto the homeowners policy and they make some money.” Exactly how much, however, could help explain why thousands of homeowners believe they were shorted. There are a couple of theories for possible shortfalls. For one, industry experts say insurance is a commercial business. It looks to lower costs and keep payments to homeowners in check. It’s just habit, they say  —   even if it’s not their money. And then, after Hurricane Katrina, FEMA tried to crack down on overpayments to homeowners, when some companies charged unrelated damage coverage to the flood program instead of their own wind coverage. But there was one more theory. The insurance companies make money on the program, regardless of how big the storm or the cost to taxpayers. But they won’t make any money on the program if it doesn’t exist. So, the theory goes, the companies sought to cut the program’s debt to save the program  —   and they did that by paying homeowners less. ”It was batten down the hatches and circle the wagons,” says Steve Mostyn, a plaintiff’s attorney who joined the fight with other lawyers to sue the insurance companies on behalf of 1, 300 homeowners impacted by Sandy. ”It was a systematic culture and plan to hold back the losses.” Mostyn has scoured insurance company documents for almost two years. He points to the repeated hearings Congress has held on Capitol Hill over the past few years asking why this program is so far in debt and talking about privatizing the flood program or even ending it. ”They’ve had this, ’You owe Congress     deal’ hanging over their head,” since Katrina, he says. ”And I think that they thought if they didn’t protect this pot that they had, if they went deeply into debt again, that there would be a push to end the National Flood Insurance Program. You got to protect the goose that lays the golden egg.” But to know whether that is right, you would have to know how much the companies are making. In 2009, a Government Accountability Office audit told FEMA to figure out how much profit the flood insurance companies are making off the flood program and take that into account when it paid them. But Wright, who took over the flood program for FEMA last year, says he doesn’t know how much money the insurance companies make from the program. ”I’ve never looked at the book of business to understand their profits,” he says. ”So you’d need to go specifically to the companies to understand those numbers.” The nation’s largest insurance firms declined to disclose their profit margins on the flood program. However, every year the insurance companies report what it actually costs them to do their flood work to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an industry association of government regulators. And every year, FEMA reports what it pays insurers who participate in the flood program. With both numbers, you can do some math. Government auditors used a similar method in 2009. Based on the latest figures, that analysis shows the insurance companies together made anywhere from $240 million to $406 million a year just on their flood work since 2011  —   without having to pay any claims. A Curious Pattern Emerges Among Homeowner Claims, But if these profits led insurance companies to try to protect a program by paying homeowners less, is it even possible for multiple insurance companies to systematically shortchange people, as hundreds of lawsuits in New York and New Jersey allege? Far from Superstorm Sandy’s epicenter, in Houston, attorney Mostyn found a curious similarity among many of the homeowners he now represents in his lawsuit against the insurers. He said he found a pattern among engineering reports that were used to reject or justify lower payments on homeowners’ insurance claims. There seemed to be a template that many of the reports followed, which says the houses hit by the storm were not structurally damaged by the flood but were damaged by ”  differential earth movement.” That means natural forces over a long period of time damaged the home  —   not whatever disaster just occurred. That’s what homeowner Quinn was given for the reason his insurance company, Selective, used to deny much of his claim on his home along the New Jersey coast. But Quinn was confounded. He had photos of his foundation from a year earlier. He didn’t have any cracks. The day after the storm, large cracks were all over his foundation. Quinn says he wasn’t thinking about whether other people were in his same situation or whether the insurance companies were trying to keep the program costs down. He just thought it was a mistake. So he did what a lot of people did: He appealed to FEMA. Almost five months later, a FEMA representative replied. The agency had denied his appeal, siding with Selective. Selective declined to comment on Quinn’s case. But NPR and Frontline obtained a copy of Quinn’s case file. In it were emails between FEMA and Selective that Quinn had never seen before. We showed the file to Quinn, and he started to read. As he got to the end, he saw where it says FEMA sent Selective his appeal and then asked Selective to review it and write a response. First, Quinn reacted with an expletive. Then he said ”This is not an objective third party review process. This is complete crap.” According to FEMA’s own internal documents, FEMA sided with insurance companies almost 75 percent of the time. A government audit recently found that the process received inadequate oversight from FEMA. Wright acknowledges FEMA sent appeals to insurance companies. Wright says he is making changes to the appeals process to ensure that it’s more transparent and that homeowners get a fair review. ”The appeals process that was in place in the past did not have enough credibility,” he says, adding the appeals have now been moved into a different department separate from claims review. Last year a Senate committee couldn’t find any widespread underpayments of claims. But since then, FEMA has reopened claims review for anyone who felt underpaid by his insurance company. More than 19, 000 people came forward in addition to the 1, 700 who sued. So far, FEMA is finding that more than 80 percent of the homeowners were underpaid by their insurance companies. As for Quinn, he sued and eventually settled with Selective. In addition to the $90, 000 in claim money that he received, his settlement gave him an additional $130, 000. Quinn paid   of his settlement in legal fees. Win or lose, FEMA pays all the insurers’ attorney fees. Standing on his empty lot, Quinn opens a storage container with all that survived the storm: a couple of ceiling fans, boxes from his attic, a hockey helmet. Until he can rebuild, he’ll keep paying a mortgage and flood insurance on a house that no longer exists.  ”I don’t begrudge somebody making a living, and if they do a good living at it, there’s nothing wrong with that,” he says. ”But when they do it on the backs of other people’s misery, it is just wrong and it infuriates me.” And he, like many other Sandy survivors, feels his government let him down. ”They can’t begin to fathom the amount of heartache that they’ve created,” he says. ”The amount of financial wreckage they’ve created for average people. We’re average   people and we’re in ruins here.” Frontline’s Emma Schwartz, Rick Young and Fritz Kramer contributed to this story.",-0.5
"Republicans already jittery about Obamacare repeal. Washington (CNN) Republicans are just getting started on their   dream of repealing Obamacare, and already, there are fears that things are moving too fast. Some Republicans are cautioning against repealing the Affordable Care Act too quickly and urging the party take the foot off the accelerator. The reason: there’s no plan on how to replace what they roll back. And while GOP lawmakers are eager to please their base with headlines of Obamacare’s repeal, they don’t want to be blamed for leaving people without health insurance and chaos in the healthcare market. Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday that he supports taking a slower approach to repealing the law, saying he is ”always worried about something that took a long time in the making and we’ve got to concentrate our efforts to making sure that we do it right so that nobody’s left out.” Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House Speaker and a close ally of   Donald Trump, told CNN that a big risk for Republicans is getting blamed for taking away people’s health coverage. Nightcap: Congress returns  —   with a House GOP stumble | Sign up, ”Number one thing (Republicans) have to avoid is putting themselves in a position where Democrats can frighten people    that somehow, they won’t have access to health care because of Republicans,” Gingrich said.   Gingrich stressed that before Republicans send a bill repealing Obamacare to Trump’s desk, the party must make real progress on a replacement plan. ”They have to have bridges to give people a sense of comfort that they’re not going to be abandoned,” he said.   GOP Sen. Rand Paul cited potential insurance market problems if the law isn’t replaced when it is repealed. ”If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare,” he said in an   Tuesday. ”For mark my words, Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come.”  These initial hints of anxiety from Republicans foreshadow an internal GOP    on Obamacare in the coming weeks. For now, party leaders are leaning towards a repeal bill that includes a   or   transition period that would offer a buffer    a strategy that has been dubbed ”repeal and delay.” House and Senate Republicans both started procedural efforts Tuesday    the first day of the new session of Congress    that will lead to overhauling Obamacare.   But healthcare experts warn that even if the repeal doesn’t go into effect right away, the uncertainty could lead to insurance companies fleeing the marketplace and potentially putting millions of people’s coverage at risk.    In a clear effort to counter some of the early criticism, leaders of the conservative House Republican Study Committee plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday that they argue would both repeal and replace Obamacare.  The bill was previously introduced by GOP Rep. Phil Roe, a physician, and has not been endorsed by leadership. While it is unlikely to emerge as the main Obamacare repeal bill in the House, it marks an effort by conservatives to push back on the suggestion that the party has no replacement plan.   Democrats turn the tables, All of this comes as Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. Lawmakers are planning a PR blitz throughout the month of January, accusing Republicans for possibly putting millions of Americans’ health coverage in jeopardy. Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, warned that repeal and delay approach would result in a ”chaotic” scene.  ”I’m just going to caution again, my friends: Don’t repeal this unless there’s a bipartisan group,” Manchin said. ”And if you don’t have anything to replace it with, don’t put repeal on the board.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on a call Monday that the GOP’s ”repeal and delay” strategy amounts to ”an act of cowardice,” and warned that Democrats will play no role in helping their colleagues across the aisle replace the ACA.   ”It’s the old thing of going into a china shop    you break it, you own it,” Pelosi said.  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Tuesday that she is in the process of crafting   on Obamacare, along the lines of: ”Look at what this is going to do to people.”  ”That’s the important thing,” she said. ”How many people are going to lose their healthcare?”",-1.0
"Syrian forces attack rebel-held areas of Homs, Deraa, Damacus: monitors.  Syrian warplanes bombarded a besieged   district of Homs, southern Deraa and insurgent areas in Damascus’s outskirts on Saturday in what appeared to be intensifying assaults in the west of the country, monitors said. Much of western Syria is covered by an ongoing but shaky ceasefire between the government and rebels that took effect on Dec. 30, but fighting has rumbled on, with warring sides accusing each other of truce violations as peace talks loom in Geneva next week. On Damascus’s northeastern outskirts, Syrian government forces attacked the   Qaboun and Barzeh districts with rockets and shells and killed at least nine people, the   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. A Reuters witness heard the sounds of heavy bombardment coming from the area. There was no immediate comment from the government side. To the north, Syrian jets bombarded the last   district of Homs,   killing at least two people and raising the death toll from nearly two weeks of air strikes there to more than 20, an activist and the Observatory said.  A military media unit run by Damascus’s ally Hezbollah said insurgents in   had been attacked by warplanes and artillery after rebel sniper fire hit neighboring areas. For months,   had been spared much of the intense violence raging elsewhere, as the government tried to do a deal with rebels to let them leave with their families. Similar agreements elsewhere in the west have resulted in rebels leaving with light weapons and heading mostly for Idlib province. The opposition says such accords are part of a government strategy to forcibly displace populations from   areas after years of siege and bombardment. In September, some 120 rebel fighters and their families left   in agreement with the government, but there have been no further reports of insurgents leaving. The Observatory estimates several thousand rebels remain there. In the southern province of Deraa, government and Russian warplanes stepped up their bombardment of   areas, carrying out at least 70 air strikes on Friday and Saturday, on Deraa city and towns to the east, the Observatory reported. At least four people were killed in the town of Umm   and one person in Busra   it said. The ceasefire deal is backed by Russia, which is supporting Syrian President Bashar   and by Turkey, which backs some rebel groups, but fighting has continued almost since it took effect. The radical Islamist group Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh   the former Syrian branch of al Qaeda, are not included in the ceasefire.  (Reporting by John Davison; Editing by Kevin Liffey) DOHA Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.     forces edged into the final redoubts of the two capitals of Islamic State’s   caliphate in Iraq and Syria on Tuesday, hampered by fierce resistance from the militants and the presence of human shields.

"Cultural Revolution Shaped Xi Jinping, From Schoolboy to Survivor - The New York Times. Editors’ note: We are resurfacing this 2015 article on Xi Jinping ahead of the Chinese president’s visit to the United States on Thursday to meet with President Trump. BEIJING  —   When the pandemonium of the Cultural Revolution erupted, he was a slight, softly spoken    who loved classical Chinese poetry. Two years later, adrift in a city torn apart by warring Red Guards, Xi Jinping had hardened into a combative street survivor. His father, a senior Communist Party official who had been purged a few years earlier, was seized and repeatedly beaten. Student militants ransacked his family’s home, forcing the family to flee, and one of his sisters died in the mayhem. Paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution and denounced by his own mother, the future president of China was on the edge of being thrown into a prison for delinquent children of the party elite. Visiting the United States this week, Mr. Xi, 62, has presented himself as a polished statesman, at ease hobnobbing with American capitalists in Seattle and attending a state dinner at the White House in his honor, set for Friday. Yet his first immersion in politics came on the streets of the Chinese capital during the most tumultuous era of Communist rule, when Mao Zedong exhorted students “to bombard the headquarters” of order. “I always had a stubborn streak and wouldn’t put up with being bullied,” Mr. Xi recalled in an interview in 2000, one of the few times he has spoken about his experience as a teenager in Beijing. “I riled the radicals, and they blamed me for everything that went wrong. ” Mr. Xi has often discussed the seven years he spent exiled to a rural village during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution, including in a speech in Seattle on Tuesday, casting that chapter of his life as an uplifting story of a city boy who discovers the suffering of ordinary Chinese in the countryside and resolves to make a difference. But Mr. Xi has rarely spoken in public about his experiences from 1966 to 1968 at the tumultuous start of the Cultural Revolution, and his close contemporaries refuse to talk to foreign journalists about those years. An examination of memoirs written by them and by members of Mr. Xi’s family, though, offers an unusually vivid look at how a shy, bookish youth, raised in the bosom of party privilege, was tested and changed by the chaos that unfolded after Mao’s decision to turn the masses against the party establishment. Mr. Xi started his transformation in the equivalent of the seventh grade in the August 1 School, a cloistered boarding school largely reserved for children with parents in the senior ranks of the party and the military. When Cultural Revolution militants shut it down, he ended up at the No. 25 School, which was a hotbed of discontent with the party elite, said Qian Peizhen, chairwoman of the school’s alumni association. But as order broke down, Mr. Xi, like many youths, spent little time in class. Mr. Xi and a friend “would hang out all day,” Ms. Qian said. After fleeing their home, he, his mother and his siblings took refuge at the Central Party School, an academy for officials. “We grew up in a highly abnormal environment,” Li Xiaobing, a classmate at the August 1 School, recalled on a school alumni website. The purges, zealotry and mass strife that Mao unleashed during the Cultural Revolution left a lasting mark on every Chinese leader who has succeeded him. But Mr. Xi stands out because he is the first party chief from the generation of the Red Guards  —   the youths who served as Mao’s shock troops  —   and because he fell so far before beginning his trek to power, from a family in the party elite to an unmoored life as a teenage political pariah. Some of Mr. Xi’s critics argue that his experiences during the Cultural Revolution inform his authoritarian ways. But the imprint of that time was more complex than that, said Patricia M. Thornton, a professor at Oxford who is researching the Cultural Revolution and its legacy. Mr. Xi’s generation venerated Mao, she said, but his family suffered in the violence that Mao unleashed, and Mr. Xi’s outlook is rooted in an elitist rejection of that turmoil. “Xi got to see both sides of that time, which is one reason I think he’s such an interesting character,” she said, “but that’s also why he’s so difficult to read. ” Unlike some youths from elite backgrounds, Mr. Xi did not turn against the party or Mao, but learned to revere strict order and abhor challenges to hierarchy, said Yongyi Song, a historian and librarian in Los Angeles who has long studied the Cultural Revolution. “He suffered much under Mao,” Mr. Song said, “but I think that actually increased his belief that those who are ‘born red,’ those children of the party elite, earned the right to inherit Mao’s place at the center. ” At the August 1 School, Mr. Xi and other students were expected to be exemplary servants of the socialist revolution. “We took the children to clean out latrines, and they did a really fine job,” a former teacher, Tang Yuhua, said in an interview for the school alumni association. “The children of officials did what they were told. ” One of Mr. Xi’s teachers, Chen Qiuying, recalled him as a studious, elaborately polite boy who was fond of Du Fu, an ancient Chinese poet. He had a “very steady, kind personality,” she said in an interview published in Hong Kong. But Mr. Xi and his brothers and sisters were vulnerable when the Cultural Revolution began because Mao had turned on their father, Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary veteran and vice premier, four years earlier. He lost his post and was sent to work in a factory in central China, while his wife, Qi Xin, kept her job as a party cadre in Beijing. Many of the first Red Guards who embraced Mao’s call in August 1966 to purge society of ideological enemies and traitors were the children of party officials. But Mr. Xi could not join them because he was too young and had been tainted by his father’s fall. Instead, he became a target of abuse, Ms. Chen said. “He told me of one incident, in which a primary school sports teacher with a very poor attitude bullied him when the wave of physical assaults in the Cultural Revolution was spreading,” she said. The sports teacher, she recalled, mocked him as “child of a black gang,” a term for toppled officials. Radicals accused students at the school of betraying Mao by defending their parents and privileges. A journal published by Red Guards described the school as “a cradle for pampering the sons of senior cadres” that had “bred a successor class of the bourgeoisie. ” Violence was encouraged and widespread. In August and September of 1966, nearly 1, 800 people died in attacks across Beijing, according to party estimates issued in 1980. Mr. Xi lost an elder sister, Xi Heping, his father’s first daughter through an earlier marriage. Official accounts say she was “persecuted to death,” leaving out details, but a historian familiar with the party elite who spoke on condition of anonymity said she probably had taken her own life under duress, as many targeted by the Red Guards did in those years. Mr. Xi’s father, exiled in central China, was seized by Red Guards, who took him to Xi’an, a city in northwest China. There they paraded him around on a truck, beat and interrogated him, and made outlandish accusations that he had used a secret radio set in his home for clandestine foreign contacts. As the Cultural Revolution spiraled into mayhem, Mr. Xi learned to fend for himself. “We were the ‘blackest’ in the class, and the others all despised us,” recalled Nie Weiping, a classmate at the No. 25 School whose father had also been purged. “They wouldn’t come near us, and we also despised them. ” One day, he, Mr. Xi and another teenage friend with a purged father, Liu Weiping, were among a large group ambushed by radical Red Guards outside a school hall. “Hundreds of them came rushing out, waving clubs and yelling, and they beat whomever they saw,” Mr. Nie said in a memoir. “Xi Jinping and I moved fast and escaped,” he said, “but Liu Weiping ran a step slower, and almost suffered a concussion from a beating. ” In the interview published in 2000, when he was still a provincial official, Mr. Xi recalled being singled out and detained by the radicals because of his refusal to yield. “They all believed I was a leader,” he said. “They asked me how bad I thought my crimes were,” he said. “I said that they should make a guess, was it enough to deserve being shot? They said it would be enough to be shot 100 times over. I thought, what was the difference between being shot once and 100 times?” “Afterwards,” he added, “I recited the thoughts of Chairman Mao every day late into the night. ” At one point, militants paraded Mr. Xi and five adults on a stage before a rally, according to an associate of Mr. Xi’s father, Yang Ping, citing conversations with the father and family. Mr. Xi had to use both hands to hold up the   metal hat he was made to wear. “The mother had no choice but to go to the struggle session and sat below the stage,” Mr. Yang wrote. “When they yelled, ‘Down with Xi Jinping!’ on the stage, his mother was forced to raise her arm and shout the slogan along with everyone. ” By late 1968, Mr. Xi’s record of defiance was enough that he was ordered to a juvenile detention center for the children of purged officials. But he was spared imprisonment after Mao issued a call for urban youths to go to the countryside. He did not see his father again until 1972, when Premier Zhou Enlai arranged a family reunion. The father, battered and disoriented after years of isolation and interrogation, “looked at his two grown boys, and totally failed to recognize them,” according to his father’s biography, citing an interview with Mr. Xi. The older man wept, and Mr. Xi offered him a cigarette. “He asked me, ‘How come you also smoke? ’” Mr. Xi said. “I said: ‘I’m depressed. We’ve also made it through tough times over these years.’ “He went quiet for a moment and said, ‘I grant you approval to smoke. ’”",-1.0
"Species-identifying AI gets a boost from images snapped by citizen naturalists – TechCrunch. Someday we’ll have an app that you can point at a weird bug or unfamiliar fern and have it spit out the genus and species. But right now computer vision systems just aren’t up to the task. To help things along, researchers have assembled hundreds of thousands of images taken by regular folks of critters in real life situations — and by studying these, our AI helpers may be able to get a handle on biodiversity. Many computer vision algorithms have been trained on one of several large sets of images, which may have everything from people to household objects to fruits and vegetables in them. That’s great for learning a little about a lot of things, but what if you want to go deep on a specific subject or type of image? You need a special set of lots of that kind of image. For some specialties, we have that already: FaceNet, for instance, is the standard set for learning how to recognize or replicate faces. But while computers may have trouble recognizing faces, we rarely do — while on the other hand, I can never remember the name of the birds that land on my feeder in the spring. I feel like I know these computer-generated celebrities already Fortunately, I’m not the only one with this problem, and for years the community of the iNaturalist app has been collecting pictures of common and uncommon animals for identification. And it turns out that these images are the perfect way to teach a system how to recognize plants and animals in the wild. Could you tell the difference? Could you tell the difference? You might think that a computer could learn all it needs to from biology textbooks, field guides and National Geographic. But when you or I take a picture of a sea lion, it looks a lot different from a professional shot: the background is different, the angle isn’t perfect, the focus is probably off and there may even be other animals in the shot. Even a good computer vision algorithm might not see much in common between the two. The photos taken through the iNaturalist app, however, are all of the amateur type — yet they have also been validated and identified by professionals who, far better than any computer, can recognize a species even when it’s occluded, poorly lit or blurry. The researchers, from Caltech, Google, Cornell and iNaturalist itself, put together a limited subset of the more than 1.6 million images in the app’s databases, presented this week at CVPR in Salt Lake City. They decided that in order for the set to be robust, it should have lots of different angles and situations, so they searched for species that have had at least 20 different people spot them. The resulting set of images (PDF) still has more than 859,000 pictures of over 5,000 species. These they had people annotate by drawing boxes around the critter in the picture, so the computer would know what to pay attention to. A set of images was set aside for training the system, another set for testing it. Examples of bounding boxes being put on images. Examples of bounding boxes being put on images. Ironically, they can tell it’s a good set because existing image recognition engines perform so poorly on it, not even reaching 70 percent first-guess accuracy. The very qualities that make the images themselves so amateurish and difficult to parse make them extremely valuable as raw data; these pictures haven’t been sanitized or set up to make it any easier for the algorithms to sort through. Even the systems created by the researchers with the iNat2017 set didn’t fare so well. But that’s okay — finding where there’s room to improve is part of defining the problem space. The set is expanding, as others like it do, and the researchers note that the number of species with 20 independent observations has more than doubled since they started working on the data set. That means iNat2018, already under development, will be much larger and will likely lead to more robust recognition systems. The team says they’re working on adding more attributes to the set so that a system will be able to report not just species, but sex, life stage, habitat notes and other metadata. And if it fails to nail down the species, it could in the future at least make a guess at the genus or whatever taxonomic rank it’s confident about — e.g. it may not be able to tell if it’s anthopleura elegantissima or anthopleura xanthogrammica, but it’s definitely an anemone. This is just one of many parallel efforts to improve the state of computer vision in natural environments; you can learn more about the ongoing collection and competition that leads to the iNat data sets here, and other more class-specific challenges are listed here.",0.0
"Obama’s Cyber Negligence. There are four   stories that have cropped up recently to which everyone should be paying close attention: This past week, DMV offices all over California had their computer systems shut down by what was apparently a hardware failure. There’s evidently no reason to suspect the DMV’s systems were attacked, but the incident shows off the frailty of government computer systems, the ease with which the whole edifice can collapse when a single brick is smashed (accidentally or intentionally). That is exactly what happened to large swaths of the Internet two weeks ago, when Dyn, one of the U. S.’s major DNS hosts, was flooded by a tidal wave of artificial internet traffic. It tried to convert addresses for so many fake browsing requests that it was unable to respond to the real ones, like a bartender getting 10, 000 orders for Banana Daiquiris just before you try to order a beer. With their DNS host overwhelmed, sites such as Twitter, CNN, Paypal, Reddit, Spotify, and Netflix stopped working. One week before that, WikiLeaks began publishing John Podesta’s   and the Clinton campaign decided that it would try to redirect the story toward Russia, which they say is responsible for stealing Podesta’s email. That might not be true it’s certainly possible that it is  —   various intelligence agencies seem to think so. There is no doubt that Russia would like to tamper with our elections, or, short of that, to appear to be tampering with them. Because the Obama administration has a more or less established policy of   to    —   from Russia, from China, from North Korea, from Iran  —   the Kremlin no doubt felt comfortable giving it a try. But it turns out there is a line in the sand that, being crossed, can get President Obama to treat a foreign power as hostile, and that’s exposing the corruption of the Democratic party. Now, suddenly, Obama has found a belligerent tone for Putin. However, a week before the WikiLeaks dumps began  —   and over the strong objections of congressional Republicans  —   Obama relinquished American control of ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is the body that is ultimately responsible for the internet’s DNS    and could in theory stop access to any website it wanted. Now, instead of the U. S. having ultimate control over its policies, ICANN will be a private corporation advised by an international committee that includes China, Iran, and Russia. If there’s one thing a month of   can tell us, it’s that foreign dictatorships can be trusted not abuse that power.  —   Josh Gelernter writes weekly for NRO and is a regular contributor to The Weekly Standard.

"In Massachusetts, Trump’s immigration crackdown harms drug epidemic fight. Mayor Daniel Rivera sits in his corner office on the third floor city hall, in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He pores over a typed response to US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ most recent threat to cut Department of Justice funding to jurisdictions dubbed “sanctuary cities”. He doesn’t understand why the federal government would try to drain a city of resources when it is already struggling to fight an opioid epidemic that has led to thousands of deaths across New England. Traditionally, Lawrence has operated as one of the major landing spots for narcotics that cross the Mexican border. Rivera and other officials in Lawrence say Trump’s immigration policy is an additional strain on law enforcement efforts to address the drug crisis in their   town. And they fear it might get worse. “I think it’s weird that they would go after public safety dollars,” said Rivera. “Don’t say the answer to this is coming down and taking our   money, our bulletproof vest money, because that doesn’t make any sense. ” Lawrence is a “drug market” Rivera admits. It’s been that way for decades. Built by design in 1845 to be separate from the wealthy New England neighborhoods that surround it, Lawrence, the first planned factory city in America, is squeezed in less than seven miles between the Merrimack and Spicket rivers. When factory jobs disappeared in the 1950s, drugs took their place, creating an industry the police chief describes as “grassroots”. With a small but consistent heroin market already established, the opioid epidemic hit Lawrence early, and quickly took on new dimensions. In one pending federal case, a man was charged with monitoring local heroin dealers by placing GPS devices on their cars and orchestrating a group of men dressed as police  —   having them pull the dealers over, throw them in the back of a minivan, and torture them with irons until their loved ones came up with ransom. “We’re doing what we can,” Rivera says of attempts to fight back against the drug trade. In February, along with the city of Chelsea, Lawrence filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump’s administration for threatening to take funding away from sanctuary cities, a broad definition for those jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Under Lawrence’s policy, the city has refused to turn over people to the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency without a criminal warrant. When the city first made this official policy in what was known as the “Trust Act” Rivera opposed the legislation. “I thought there was more folly in publicizing you are a sanctuary city,” he said. Since the election, though, he’s has seen the need to go public with this profile. “We   …     believe that it is unconstitutional for the Federal Govt. to claw back monies they already gave us,” Rivera wrote in his letter to Sessions, referring to the $90, 000 of justice department money they city has used on bulletproof vests and police radios. In addition to threats to cut funding, Trump’s new immigration executive orders and   rhetoric are giving the police department distractions and hurdles in communicating with constituents. The chief of police, James Fitzpatrick, has worked to quash rumors of raids by federal immigration agents.  Fitzpatrick, who himself once worked for the federal agency formerly known as Immigration Naturalization Services before joining the Lawrence police department, understands that many in his community see Ice “like the big boogie man”. After the change in immigration policy, many who approached Fitzpatrick were terrified. “Even people who are naturalized were like, ‘They are going to take my naturalization away,’” Fitzpatrick said.  Joshua Alba, a Lawrence resident and community organizer, says the people he speaks to are increasingly fearful of law enforcement. “Rumors are flying around everywhere, people are scared,” said Alba. Exacerbating these concerns is a narrative spun by some Republican politicians in New England that immigrant drug dealers are preying on white addicts. Last August, Maine’s governor, Paul LePage, claimed, in a statement that is not backed up by evidence, that 90% of people arrested for heroin and fentanyl in his state were “not white people” and came from Lawrence, among other cities. Last month, New Hampshire’s governor, Chris Sununu, argued that law enforcement should cross state lines, and go into Lawrence to take on the “undocumented drug dealers” fueling the epidemic. Nilly Dacosta, an advocate who works with homeless people and those suffering from addiction in Lawrence, says that people come to Lawrence because drug prices closer to the source are cheaper. He says only a small fraction of the people he interacts with are immigrants and even fewer are from Lawrence.    organizations, says Dacosta, are “spending more and more time and effort on people who are [from] outside of the city”. Rivera is tired of defending Lawrence.  “I think it’s just easy to kick people who you think are down,” said Rivera. “They are scapegoating the city because we have immigrants they are scapegoating the city because we have a drug problem. ” Instead, said Rivera, the federal government should “take a page from Bill Belichick” and “do your job”. Which, in this case, Rivera said, meant investing money in opioid treatment. ",-0.5
"Erdoğan blames Isis for suspected suicide attack at wedding in Turkey. Hundreds of mourners gathered in the   Turkish city of Gaziantep on Sunday to bury the victims of a suspected suicide bombing that struck a wedding celebration.  At least 54 people were killed and dozens more injured by the blast, which Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, blamed on Islamic State and said had been carried out by a child of between 12 and 14 years old. At least 22 of the victims were under the age of 14, a government official said. More than 60 people are still in hospital being treated for their wounds. Condemning the attack, which was the deadliest to hit Turkey this year, Erdoğan said any strategy “meant to incite the citizens against each other along ethnic and religious lines will not work”. Mahmut Toğrul, a local MP, said the wedding guests were largely supporters of his   Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP). “This was not a random target and not just any wedding,” he told the Guardian. “Most of the people celebrating at the wedding were HDP supporters. People came together to celebrate, they were defenceless. [Isis] has always targeted civilians, but we need to see this attack as a revenge attack on Kurds. ” Isis, which has not claimed the attack  —   historically it has not claimed attacks in Turkey  —   has recently lost swaths of territory in northern Syria to   fighters. Some analysts as well as locals have pointed to this as possible motivation for attacks against Kurds.  Metin Gürcan, a security analyst, said: “This is the first Isis attack targeting ethnically aware and politically active Kurds at a purely civilian occasion, a wedding. We know very well to what extent wedding attacks can sow disorder in a nation’s social fabric from [experience] in Afghanistan. “Isis has been trying to exploit ethnic and sectarian fault lines in Gaziantep both to retaliate against the advancement of Syrian Kurds in the north of Syria and against Turkey’s attack against Isis targets inside Syria. ” Nazım Daştan, a local journalist, described a scene of devastation in the neighbourhood of Şahinbey after the blast hit at about 10. 50pm on Saturday . “There were so many dead people. There were body parts,” he said. “A wedding really is the last place that one would expect an attack on  —   it’s horrifying. It seems clear that this was yet another Isis attack in Gaziantep. ” The bomb was reported to have exploded as wedding guests spilled out into the streets after the traditional henna night party, when guests have their hands and feet painted. One witness, Veli Can, said: “The celebrations were coming to an end and there was a big explosion among people dancing . There was blood and body parts everywhere. ”  Children including a    baby were among the dead, witnesses told Reuters. Toğrul said identifying those killed was taking time because many victims were children without ID cards. Neither the bride nor groom is understood to have been killed or seriously injured in the attack . The bride was quoted by the   Anadolu news agency as declaring: “They turned our wedding into a bloodbath. ” On Sunday as some of the first funerals were held, shouts of “shame on you, Erdoğan” were reportedly heard  and mourners hurled water bottles at police.  There has been a string of deadly attacks in Turkey in the past year that were either blamed on Isis or claimed by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and its radical offshoot, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK). In June, suspected Isis militants attacked Atatürk airport in Istanbul, killing at least 47 people. The latest blast comes a month after a military coup attempt blamed by the Turkish government on a network linked to the   cleric Fethullah Gülen. Speaking on television, the deputy prime minister, Mehmet Şimşek, said: “This was a barbaric attack. It appears to be a suicide attack. All terror groups, the PKK, Daesh, the [Gülen movement] are targeting Turkey. But God willing, we will overcome. ” To ğrul said the Isis threat had been ignored by the Turkish government. “We have said for years that Isis was active in Gaziantep. This danger has been present for a long time, but unfortunately we never succeeded in convincing the government of this,” he said. “The necessary precautions were not taken. ”  Turkish media reported that local Isis cells had previously considered an attack on a wedding of PKK supporters in Gaziantep. Yunus Durmaz, an alleged former head of an Isis cell in Turkey and said to be one of the planners of the twin suicide bomb attacks on a peace rally in Ankara in October 2015 that killed at least 100 people, had suggested such an assault to an Isis contact inside Syria, according to the Turkish daily Gazete Duvar, citing an indictment.  Durmaz killed himself during a police raid in Gaziantep on 19 May, and Turkish police were able to secure evidence of his communications from his computer. Analysts have long warned of the presence of an extensive Isis network in the city, which is 29 miles (46km) north of the Syrian border. Akif Ekici, an MP for the main opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) told Turkish media there was a “serious intelligence deficiency” and the government should work together with the opposition to prevent further attacks.  The Turkish government urged people not to let recent attacks divide them. “Today is a day of unity and togetherness,” said the prime minister, Binali Yıldırım. “We stand united with our citizens, from the youngest to the oldest, against terrorism. Our pain is immense, but everyone should be assured that our unity and togetherness will spoil these devilish plans in our country and abroad. ” Gürcan urged the Turkish government to rethink its security strategy. “Turkey desperately needs a new security policy and approach,” he said. “Ankara is making a strategic mistake [by] putting the PKK, Isis and the Fethullah Gülen terror organisation in the same basket, by saying that [these groups] are mere instruments used by foreign powers trying to destabilise Turkey. “This approach . .. underestimates their agency and causes the failure of tailoring an    . ” Selahattin Demirtaş,   of the HDP, said: “Let’s stand together for the condolences. There is no such thing as your funeral or my funeral. There are only our funerals. “I call on all our MP friends from the AKP, the [Nationalist Movement party] MHP and the CHP in Gaziantep. Come and let’s stand together for the condolences. Let’s unite our pain, let’s show those who turn our weddings into funerals, who turn our weddings into bloodbaths, that we stand as one. After that, everything else will be easy, there will be no problem we won’t be able to solve. ”",-0.5
"Mattis: US will defend Japanese islands claimed by China.  (CNN) US Defense Secretary James Mattis on Saturday reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to defending Japan, including a group of disputed islands which have been claimed by China. ”I made clear that our   policy on the Senkaku Islands stands    the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the   Security Treaty applies,” Mattis said in a press conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. Article 5 of that treaty says the US will defend territories under Japanese administration, which would include the Senkakus, an uninhabited group of islands in the East China Sea called the Diaoyus by China. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the islands, including   between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces that have been termed dangerous by both sides. ANALYSIS: Does Mattis speak for Trump? China responded quickly to the US stance on the disputed islands, saying it brings instability to the region. ”Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The     security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China’s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. ”We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,” Lu said. Mattis’ visit to Japan and South Korea follows a campaign in which President Donald Trump unsettled the region by suggesting that Seoul and Tokyo develop their own nuclear weapons and pay more towards keeping US troops stationed in the two countries.  But in his inaugural trip as secretary of defense, Mattis has repeatedly reassured the staunch US allies of the Trump administration’s commitment to the region.  ”I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100% shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people,” Mattis said.  Contested waters, The US commitment to the disputed islands, which Mattis also reaffirmed in a Friday night meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. While the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. ’Shredded the trust’ Mattis was also critical of China’s actions in the South China Sea, where since 2014 Beijing has turned sandbars into islands, equipping them with airfields, ports and weapons systems and warned US warships and aircraft to stay away from them. ”China has shredded the trust of nations in the region,” Mattis said. ”We all play by the rules, and if we have disputes we take them to arbitration, we don’t settle them by taking military means and occupying land that is subject to question, to say the least, about who actually owns it,” he said. Mattis said the US Navy would continue to exercises freedom of navigation rights    where US warships sail through international waters    in the South China Sea, there was no need for increased US military maneuvers there. ”What we have to do is exhaust all efforts, diplomatic efforts, to try and resolve this properly,” Mattis said. RELATED: South China Sea: What’s at stake, Inada said Japan supported US actions in the South China Sea and said Tokyo would play a ”proactive role” in regional disputes. The defense chiefs also discussed the threat posed by North Korea. ”Evolution of North Korea’s nuclear and missile development is for Japan and the US and for the region’s security a grave threat,” Inada said. She also stressed that the US, Japan and South Korea face the North Korean threat with a division of roles, emphasizing the importance of the deterrence value of US   capabilities, something Japan’s constitution prevents its military from having. Who pays? In Saturday’s press conference, Mattis praised Japan’s financial contribution to the cost of keeping some 52, 000 US troops in Japan. During the US presidential campaign, Trump had said Japan might have to increase its contribution to the force. ”Japan has been a model of cost sharing and burden sharing,” Mattis said, calling Japan ”an example for other nations to follow.” The US defense chief also praised Japan’s military buildup under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which has seen increased spending on Japanese forces to the point that some analysts consider them among the world’s best. ”I think Japan is on the right track,” Mattis said. Mattis said the US would continue taking steps to lessen the US military footprint on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. Both sides agreed the US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa would be relocated to Henoko, a less densely populated section of the island, Inada said. ’Overwhelming’ response, Mattis arrived in Tokyo on Friday from South Korea, the first stop in his first overseas trip as US defense secretary. While in Seoul, he he pledged to deploy THAAD    the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense   system    to protect US and South Korean troops.  ”North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,” Mattis said at a press conference in Seoul on Friday. Speaking alongside South Korean Defense Minister Han   he added: ”Any attack on the United States or on our allies will be defeated and any use of nuclear weapons will be met with a response that will be effective and overwhelming.” A statement on Pyongyang’s Korean Central News Agency said deployment of THAAD is pushing the Korean peninsula to the ”brink of a nuclear war.” The statement said THAAD was part of an offensive strategy between Seoul and Washington, alleging the two had ”worked out a plan for a preemptive attack on the North and . .. desperately pushed forward it, pushing the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war.” On Thursday Mattis said Pyongyang’s ”provocative behavior” made THAAD necessary.",-1.0
"Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels - The New York Times. SUNNYVALE, Calif.  —   For more than a decade, Silicon Valley’s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie. Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a “Like” button. The new era in Silicon Valley centers on artificial intelligence and robots, a transformation that many believe will have a payoff on the scale of the personal computing industry or the commercial internet, two previous generations that spread computing globally. Computers have begun to speak, listen and see, as well as sprout legs, wings and wheels to move unfettered in the world. The shift was evident in a Lowe’s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries. The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock. Silicon Valley’s financiers and entrepreneurs are digging into artificial intelligence with remarkable exuberance. The region now has at least 19 companies designing   cars and trucks, up from a handful five years ago. There are also more than a   types of mobile robots, including robotic bellhops and aerial drones, being commercialized. “We saw a slow trickle in investments in robotics, and suddenly, boom  —   there seem to be a dozen companies securing large investment rounds focusing on specific robotic niches,” said Martin Hitch, chief executive of Bossa Nova, which has a base in San Francisco. Funding in A. I.   has increased more than fourfold to $681 million in 2015, from $145 million in 2011, according to the market research firm CB Insights. The firm estimates that new investments will reach $1. 2 billion this year, up 76 percent from last year. “Whenever there is a new idea, the valley swarms it,” said   Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, a chip maker that was founded to make graphic processors for the video game business but that has turned decisively toward artificial intelligence applications in the last year. “But you have to wait for a good idea, and good ideas don’t happen every day. ” By contrast, funding for social media   peaked in 2011 before plunging. That year, venture capital firms made 66 social media deals and pumped in $2. 4 billion. So far this year, there have been just 10 social media investments, totaling $6. 9 million, according to CB Insights. Last month, the professional social networking site LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26. 2 billion, underscoring that social media has become a mature market sector. Even Silicon Valley’s biggest social media companies are now getting into artificial intelligence, as are other tech behemoths. Facebook is using A. I. to improve its products. Google will soon compete with Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, which are based on A. I. with a device that listens in the home, answers questions and places   orders. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, recently appeared at the Aspen Ideas Conference and called for a partnership between humans and artificial intelligence systems in which machines are designed to augment humans. The auto industry has also set up camp in the valley to learn how to make cars that can do the driving for you. Both technology and car companies are making claims that increasingly powerful sensors and A. I. software will enable cars to drive themselves with the push of a button as soon as the end of this decade  —   despite recent Tesla crashes that have raised the question of how quickly human drivers will be completely replaced by the technology. Silicon Valley’s new A. I. era underscores the region’s ability to opportunistically reinvent itself and quickly follow the latest tech trend. “This is at the heart of the region’s culture that goes all the way back to the Gold Rush,” said Paul Saffo, a longtime technology forecaster and a faculty member at Singularity University. “The valley is built on the idea that there is always a way to start over and find a new beginning. ” The change spurred a rush for talent in A. I. that has become intense. “It’s ridiculous,” said Richard Socher, chief scientist at the software maker Salesforce, who teaches a course at Stanford on a machine intelligence technique known as deep learning. “The number of people trying to get the students to drop out of the class halfway through because now they know a little bit of this stuff is crazy. ” The valley’s tendency toward reinvention dates back to the region’s initial emergence from the ashes of a deep aerospace industry recession as a   manufacturing center producing memory chips, video games and digital watches in the  . A malaise in the personal computing market in the early 1990s was followed by the World Wide Web and the global expansion of the consumer internet. A decade later, in 2007, just as innovation in mobile phones seemed to be on the verge of moving away from Silicon Valley to Europe and Asia, Apple introduced the first iPhone, resetting the mobile communications marketplace and ensuring that the valley would  —   for at least another generation  —   remain the world’s innovation center. In the most recent shift, the A. I. idea emerged first in Canada in the work of cognitive scientists and computer scientists like Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun during the previous decade. The three helped pioneer a new approach to deep learning, a machine learning method that is highly effective for pattern recognition challenges like vision and speech. Modeled on a general understanding of how the human brain works, it has helped technologists make rapid progress in a wide range of A. I. fields. How far the A. I. boom will go is hotly debated. For some technologists, today’s technical advances are laying the groundwork for truly brilliant machines that will soon have   intelligence. Yet Silicon Valley has faced false starts with A. I. before. During the 1980s, an earlier generation of entrepreneurs also believed that artificial intelligence was the wave of the future, leading to a flurry of  . Their products offered little business value at the time, and so the commercial enthusiasm ended in disappointment, leading to a period now referred to as the “A. I. Winter. ” The current resurgence will not fall short this time, said several investors, who believe that the economic potential in terms of new efficiency and new applications is strong. “There is no chance of a new winter,” said Shivon Zilis, an investor at Bloomberg Beta who specializes in machine intelligence  . John Shoch, a veteran venture capitalist at Alloy Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif. said deep learning has made a difference to the potential success of A. I. companies. “You get a new set of tools that let you attack a new set of problems, which let you push the boundary out,” he said. For others, like Jerry Kaplan, who helped found two A. I. companies in the 1980s  —   Symantec, which became a security company, and Teknowledge, which ultimately shut down  —   the Valley’s new enthusiasm is troubling because it suggests an unfounded optimism similar to earlier eras in which the field overpromised and underdelivered. “Sometimes when I hang around with A. I. enthusiasts here in the valley, I feel like an atheist at a convention of evangelicals,” he said.",-1.0
"Florida Airport Assailant May Have Heard Voices Urging Violence, Officials Say - The New York Times. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Federal law enforcement officials said they were investigating whether the gunman who opened fire on Friday at the airport here, killing five people and wounding eight, was mentally disturbed and heard voices in his head telling him to commit acts of violence. According to a senior law enforcement official, the gunman, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into the F. B. I. office in Anchorage in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care. Mr. Santiago, appearing “agitated and incoherent,” said “that his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency,” the official said. Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Santiago, who was captured in the airport, had been inspired by terrorist groups, including the Islamic State. The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet. Shortly after 1 p. m. Friday, the suspect, who had been an airline passenger, pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his bag and opened fire in a crowded baggage claim area in Terminal 2, officials said. The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, running and seeking cover, at times in response to erroneous rumors of   attacks. David Fogarty, a carpenter from Key West, was heading to Cancún, Mexico, on vacation when the people around him suddenly began running toward the gates. “Everybody was dropping gear, panicking, jumping over tables,” Mr. Fogarty said in a phone interview. “We were saying: ‘What is going on? Are there people shooting?’ I am not hearing any gunshots, and the whole place is panicking. ” Officers took Mr. Santiago into custody without firing a shot, and on Friday evening, he was being interviewed by F. B. I. agents and county investigators, as the wounded were being treated at hospitals. The senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago was making “disjointed” statements in his Anchorage F. B. I. visit. “Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities,” who took him to a medical facility for evaluation, the official said. “The F. B. I. closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks, and interviews of his family members,” the official said. On Twitter,   Donald J. Trump said that he was “monitoring the terrible situation in Florida” and that he had spoken to Gov. Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Mr. Santiago as a man who had served his country, but who had experienced trouble and failure. Mr. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for “unsatisfactory performance,” according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, the spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Mr. Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, N. J. who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record. In an email, Ms. Olmstead said that Mr. Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. In 2010, he deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the 130th Engineer Battalion, which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges he was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. At least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is nothing in the record that indicates Mr. Santiago had been in combat. Ms. Olmstead said he served in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014. Before his discharge last year, he worked as a combat engineer as a private first class. An official service record released on Friday by the Army showed that Mr. Santiago had received a number of commendations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal. Mr. Santiago’s brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press that Esteban was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. Nelson Cruz, a Puerto Rico senator who represents Peñuelas, the city in Puerto Rico where Mr. Santiago grew up, said he met Mr. Santiago about seven or eight years ago, and found him to be a “good young man” who loved his family. Mr. Cruz said he spoke on Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no known motive for the crime, but noted that Esteban had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. “Bryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems,” Mr. Cruz said. “He would suddenly see visions, but that he was a calm young man and was never violent. ” Esteban Santiago liked sports (particularly boxing, as Bryan is a boxing trainer) and was proud of his military career. “We don’t know what happened with this guy,” Mr. Cruz said. “He was an intelligent, brilliant young man who came back affected. When he came back from the conflict, he did not return well. ” He added that the family wanted to express condolences, but was in a state of panic over the number of news reporters outside their house. At a news conference late Friday in Florida, officials warned that learning the gunman’s motive would be a long, complex process. “We have not ruled out terrorism, and we will pursue every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack,” said George Piro, the special agent in charge of the F. B. I. ’s Miami division. The shooting comes at a tense time for a nation that has been watching nervously as terrorist attacks have occurred elsewhere in the world, and as Mr. Trump, who has promised to bar Muslims from entering the country, prepares to ascend to the presidency. Officials said that he had flown on a flight from Alaska to Minneapolis, and then to Fort   International Airport. In a Facebook post, a Broward County commissioner, Chip LaMarca, said the assailant had been a passenger on a Canadian flight who had checked his weapon in his luggage and then, upon disembarking, went to the airport bathroom to load it. “Came out shooting people in baggage claim,” Mr. LaMarca wrote. On CNN, Mark Lea, a witness, said the gunman “just randomly shot people, no rhyme or reason. ” After the shootings, the gunman lay facedown, spread eagle and “waited for the deputies to come get him,” he said. At that point, the gunman showed no remorse, Mr. Lea said. “He didn’t say anything,” he said. “Nothing. No emotion, no nothing. About as   as you could get. ” Witnesses also recounted scenes of confusion and fear. “All of a sudden there was a stampede,” said Tara Webber, 41, of Allentown, Pa. who was heading home after a   cruise to the Bahamas and was waiting with relatives in Terminal 3 for her flight. Those who were not running, she said, “hit the floor. ” She and her father, Dan Trinkle, 63, dived under a set of plastic chairs. Ms. Webber said she almost landed on a little girl, who was crying, and tried to comfort her. “This was the scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life,” said Ms. Webber, who works for her father’s limousine company. “We’re going to get a car and drive all the way home. ” Her father said he went for the floor like everyone else. “Then the cops told us to leave all our stuff and get out,” he said. “Everything was thrown around all over the place. ” Mr. Trickle said the police and airport authorities seemed unsure of how to handle the situation. “As far as I’m concerned, they weren’t prepared for something like this,” he said. “We were all out on the runway for hours. It made no sense. ” He said he and his family were allowed to leave after three hours and go to a hospital only because his girlfriend, Barbara Keinert, 57, had left her insulin on the cruise ship and needed another dose. The suspect’s name was made public by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, soon after the shooting. Mr. Nelson said he had learned the name from the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, Peter V. Neffenger. Mr. Nelson said Mr. Neffenger had also told him the suspect was in possession of an American military identification. Barbara Sharief, the mayor of Broward County, said authorities were confident that the gunman had acted alone. “Based on the preliminary reviewing of the footage tapes, he is a lone shooter,” Ms. Sharief said. “He is alive, he was not harmed, not shot. ” Airport police officers chased the gunman through the terminal as he continued to fire before apprehending him unharmed near a departure gate and arresting him. The scene that unspooled after shots rang out was intensely chaotic. Live TV showed government vehicles blocking the roads to and from the airport and scores of travelers milling on the tarmac, apparently having been evacuated from the building. Some could be seen marching en masse across the pavement, wheeling bags behind them. Moments later, the passengers would burst into movement, like frightened birds, running one way or another, apparently in reaction to concerns, which authorities later said were unfounded, that more attacks were underway. A number of witnesses called in to television news programs almost immediately after it happened. John Schlicher, a traveler who spoke in a phone interview with MSNBC, said he had been traveling with his wife and    and they were retrieving their bags from a carousel when he heard the first shot. “I wasn’t sure what it was at first, but I saw the person right to my side fall to the ground, and I turned and looked and the shooter was in the center hallway,” he told MSNBC. Mr. Schlicher did not hear the gunman speak, and described him as slender, with dark hair, and possibly wearing a blue “Star Wars”   . Mr. Schlicher said he and everyone around him dropped to the ground. “I put my head down and prayed,” he said. The shooting came as Florida lawmakers were preparing to consider legislation that would relax prohibitions on firearms. State laws allow for the purchase of rifles, handguns and shotguns without a permit, though a license is required to carry a concealed weapon in the state. The legislation, which was proposed last month, would eliminate some “  zones” in Florida  —   which currently include airport terminals, schools and government meetings. The bill was introduced by State Senator Greg Steube, a Republican and longtime opponent of   zones. As the false alarms subsided at the airport, the scene remained tense. Workers and passengers leaving the airport were searched by law enforcement personnel. Passengers who had been on planes on the tarmac were forced to stay in their seats, where they received updates from captains and crew members. Television news stations showed video of medics taking care of a bleeding victim outside the airport. News helicopters showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. With the airport shut down, the Federal Aviation Administration said that flights headed to Fort Lauderdale had been delayed or diverted to other airports. A number of travelers described harrowing moments of panic. Melody Dorward and a colleague, Amberly Buccholz, had just stepped off a Spirit Airways flight from Ohio when they got caught up in the tide of people who ran down the terminal. They joined in and were directed out to the tarmac, clustered there with others, shifting from spot to spot. Rumors of more gunfire spread through the crowd, with many convinced they had heard shots. “I called my family to say goodbye,” said Ms. Dorward, 22, an   worker, “to tell them I love them. ”",-1.0
"Trump’s inauguration crowd: Sean Spicer’s claims versus the evidence. Photographs of the National Mall in Washington DC and public transport figures for the city flatly contradict Sean Spicer’s angry insistence that Donald Trump drew “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe”. In his blistering debut as White House press secretary on Saturday, Spicer accused journalists of reporting inaccurate crowd numbers and using misrepresentative photographs “to minimise the enormous support” that he claimed the new president enjoyed at his  . “No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,” he said, before going ahead anyway to declare that Trump had attracted “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration” in person and in the world. “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm for the inauguration are shameful and wrong. ” Crowd estimates can be fraught with difficulty and there is indeed no official figure. But images of the National Mall on Friday contradicted Spicer’s assertions  —   particularly when compared with pictures from Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and the turnout for the Women’s March on Saturday. A timelapse video produced by PBS indicates that the National Mall was never full at any stage on Friday: Meanwhile, photographs show the National Mall packed with crowds just before Obama’s inauguration in 2009  —   but much more sparsely covered with people just before Trump’s ceremony. The New York Times estimated that Trump had drawn a crowd of about   the size of Obama’s, which was thought to be a record turnout of 1. 8 million. According to figures shared by the Metro Washington subway system on Twitter, 193, 000 trips had been taken by 11am on Donald Trump’s inauguration day, compared with 513, 000 during the same period on 20 January 2009 when Barack Obama took office. “Ridership” as of 11am on Saturday stood at 275, 000: more than eight times a normal Saturday and “even busier than most weekdays” the Metro tweeted. Spicer attempted to bolster his argument by giving   ridership figures for the Metro of 420, 000 on Trump’s inaugural day. However, for comparison he used a figure of 317, 000 which was the ridership figure only up to 11am on the inaugural day of 2013  —   when Barack Obama had already been in office four years and attendance was, perhaps unsurprisingly, lower than for his first inauguration. Before the inauguration itself, a video posted to Twitter by NBC’s Katy Tur showed “entire stands empty” along the parade route. Photos of the   Mike Pence, making the trip from the Capitol to the White House also suggested sparse crowds. It is worth noting that Trump drew just 4. 1% of the vote in Washington DC and lost the surrounding states of Maryland and Virginia. His inauguration also occurred on a Friday  —   a fact that does not go any way towards mitigating the comparisons with Obama’s 2009 inauguration, which fell on a Tuesday, but does contextualise the strong turnout for the Women’s March on Saturday. CNN tweeted a photograph of the National Mall taken from the National Park Service’s EarthCam on the Washington Monument when the   began, just after noon ET on Friday. Compared with the same view at the same time on Saturday during the Women’s March, there is a clear difference in crowds. The Associated Press reported that at least 500, 000 women had turned out for the Women’s March on National Mall at 9. 40am  —   more than double the initial predictions. There were also sizeable protests against Trump in other cities around the world.  It is uncertain if there are more concrete figures to come: according to the Associated Press, the National Park Service stopped releasing official estimates for events at the National Mall following a dispute over the Million Man March in 1995. The US Armed Forces Joint Task   Capital Region and the Joint Congressional Committee, which organise inaugural proceedings, would not be releasing estimates either. Politifact reported that crowds at inaugurations varied widely, with Obama raising an estimated 1 million in 2013, down from 1. 8 million in 2009 George W Bush drawing 400, 000 in 2005 after 300, 000 in 2001 and Bill Clinton 800, 000 in 1993 then 250, 000 in 1997. Before Spicer’s briefing room tirade on Saturday, Trump had told an audience at CIA headquarters that he had given his inauguration address to a “massive field of people   …     packed” he estimated, with between 1 million and 1. 5 million people. To his eye, Trump said, the crowd stretched “the   area, all the way back to the Washington Monument”  —   but a television network he didn’t name had broadcast a shot of “an empty field” and put the crowd at 250, 000. He went on to say that God had stopped rain from falling during his speech, before adding that he had “caught” the news network in a lie: “We caught them in a beauty. “And I think they’re going to pay a big price. ” But the evidence certainly seems to challenge Trump’s assertion that he had drawn a crowd of as many as 1. 5 million people.",-0.5
"Another Illegal Obamacare Bailout Appears to Be on the Way. As Ronald Reagan might say, “There they go again. ” The Obamacare Perpetual Bailout Machine went into high gear again on Friday, in a typical   news dump released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In a   memo, CMS invited insurers to settle outstanding lawsuits regarding an Obamacare bailout program  —   providing K Street a handy roadmap to obtaining more of federal taxpayers’   cash, which administration officials apparently will distribute to insurers on their way out the door. The lawsuits revolve around Obamacare’s   program, one of two ostensibly temporary programs, scheduled to expire this December, that provided a transition to the new Obamacare regime. Plans with high profits would pay into the   program, and their spending would offset deficits incurred by insurers with large losses. But where there’s a will to give a bailout, the Obama administration thinks it has a way. CMS in the last paragraph of its Friday memo states: We know that a number of issuers have sued in federal court seeking to obtain the risk corridors amounts that have not been paid to date. As in any lawsuit, the Department of Justice is vigorously defending those claims on behalf of the United States. However, as in all cases where there is litigation risk, we are open to discussing resolution of those claims. We are willing to begin such discussions at any time. Apart from being bad policy  —   and a violation of Congress’s express language forbidding a taxpayer bailout  —   such a settlement could also violate the Justice Department’s own legal guidelines. Insurers are seeking to obtain from the Judgment Fund, the entity that pays out claims stemming from federal lawsuits, what they could not obtain from Congress. But a 1998 opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) called these backdoor bailouts improper and illegal: The Judgment Fund does not become available simply because an agency may have insufficient funds at a particular time to pay a judgment. If the agency lacks sufficient funds to pay a judgment, but possesses statutory authority to make the payment, its recourse is to seek funds from Congress. Thus, if another appropriation or fund is legally available to pay a judgment or settlement, payment is “otherwise provided for” and the Judgment Fund is not available. That’s exactly the situation facing CMS regarding risk corridors. Risk corridors are considered “user fees,” and CMS has a statutory appropriation to make those payments. But Congress explicitly prohibited CMS from using taxpayer funds to supplement those user fees. In other words, Congress has “otherwise provided for”   payments  —   and insurers can’t use the Judgment Fund as an alternative source for bailout because they didn’t like Congress’s prohibition on a   bailout. At least, so say the Office of Legal Counsel in its 1998 memo (issued by the Clinton administration, remember) the comptroller general, and the   Congressional Research Service. But CMS, and possibly the Obama Justice Department, have other ideas. In defending the insurer lawsuits, Justice has not yet cited the OLC memo or made any claim that Congress, consistent with both the law and past precedent, should have the last word on any judgment. Friday’s memo clearly indicates the Obama administration’s desire for some type of corrupt bargain on its way out the door. Congress could try to act legislatively to block a potential settlement, but it has another option at its disposal. Section 2( f)(2)(C) of the rules package adopted by the House of Representatives on the first day of the 114th Congress last January provided that “the authorities provided by House Resolution 676 of the 113th Congress remain in full force and effect in the 114th Congress. ” That resolution, which led to the filing of the House v. Burwell case regarding Obamacare’s   subsidies, gave the House speaker authorization, to initiate or intervene in one or more civil actions on behalf of the House . . . regarding the failure of the President, the head of any department or agency, or any other officer or employee of the executive branch, to act in a manner consistent with that official’s duties under the Constitution and the laws of the United States with respect to implementation of any provision of [Obamacare]. In other words, Speaker Ryan already has the authority necessary to intervene in the   cases  —   to ensure that any potential “settlement” adheres to both Congress’s express will regarding bailouts and existing legal practice as outlined by both the comptroller general and the Department of Justice itself. More Obamacare ‘Repeal and Replace’? Try ‘Tweak and Move On’No, Obamacare Repeal Will Not Kill Tens of ThousandsThe shocking speed of entrenchment, c. Whether judicially, legislatively, or both, Congress should act  —   and act now. The time between now and January 20 is short, and the potential for mischief high. The legislature should go to work immediately to stop both a massive illegal bailout and another massive usurpation of Congress’s own authority by an imperial executive.,",1.0
" Always Dreaming Wins The 2017 Kentucky Derby.  In the end, it wasn’t even close: favorite Always Dreaming bolted to victory Saturday at the 143rd Kentucky Derby, leaving the competition several lengths behind. Jockey John Velazquez guided the    colt across the finish line. Lookin at Lee and Battle of Midway finished second and third, respectively. Thanks to intermittent rain, the horses and riders were forced to contend with a wet, sloppy track. Always Dreaming wins the Kentucky Derby. Always Dreaming’s victory will net well over $1 million in prize money for his owners, who include New York City’s Brooklyn Boyz Stables, as well as MeB Racing Stable, Teresa and Vinnie Viola, West Point Thoroughbreds, and Siena Farm. We just won the @KentuckyDerby, Always Dreaming launched out of the gate Saturday, initially fighting for first place with State of Honor. Though Always Dreaming then spent much of the race in second, he ultimately pulled well ahead in the final straightaway to take first. But while Always Dreaming had been a favorite to win going into the race, it was a   colt named Patch who captured many fans’ hearts in recent days. As Patch walked to the gates Saturday, the crowd at Churchill Downs erupted in cheers. Patch ultimately finished in 14th place. Saturday’s victory is the second Kentucky Derby win for Velazquez, who rode Animal Kingdom to a   finish in 2011. The Kentucky Derby is the first race in the Triple Crown, followed by the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore later this month and New York’s Belmont Stakes in June. A horse must win all three races to take the Triple Crown. The most recent Triple Crown winner, American Pharaoh, won all three races in 2015, becoming the first horse to do so since 1978.   ",-1.0

"Live Coverage of the Oregon and Kentucky Primaries. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Don’t expect to see reports of long lines at Oregon polls tonight. The enlightened state actually mails residents their ballots, along with security envelopes, and directs them to mail the paperwork back or deposit it at a   box. This system has allowed Oregon to post record turnout figures: More than 80 percent of state voters cast a ballot in the 2012 presidential election, compared to around 60 percent nationally.  This year could break records. More people than ever have registered to vote in Oregon, thanks in part to the state’s new   system, which signs up residents who apply for a state driver’s license or ID card. But there’s a catch: Voters registered under the new program still have to file paperwork to register with a political party, a step many miss. That means as many as   of the 52, 000 new voters likely won’t be able to cast a ballot this time around, according to the AP. It’s not just Democrats voting today in Oregon —  Republicans are also headed to the polls. They can still pull the lever for Ted Cruz or John Kasich, but at this point, they’re left to ratify the election of Donald Trump by voters in states where elections fell earlier in the calendar cycle. The great hope of the NeverTrump forces for a long time was that a deadlocked convention might turn to House Speaker Paul Ryan. Now, the convention won’t be deadlocked —  and even if it were, Ryan’s already counted himself out of the running. That decision makes a little more sense in light of a NBC News   SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking poll out this afternoon, which asked Republican voters who they favored more to lead the Republican Party. They went for Trump over Ryan, by 58 to 39 percent. There are three ways to read those numbers. They might be a quirk of the online survey’s methodology. They may just reflect the tendency of partisans to consolidate around their nominee, something that’s been apparent in other recent surveys. But they can also be seen as a final ratification that the GOP really is Trump’s party. Trump didn’t win a majority of the votes in many states. His opponents pointed to the weaknesses of other candidates, and to the fractured field, to explain his success. But Ryan is as popular a figure as the national party possesses, acceptable to virtually every faction. In the survey, Trump topped him by roughly equal margins among strong conservatives, conservatives, and moderates. There are any number of theories to account for the rise of Trump. But the simplest one —  and the one which this survey suggests is true —  is that Republican voters selected the nominee they actually prefer. Tensions are running high between Clinton and Sanders supporters in the wake of Nevada’s chaotic state Democratic convention over the weekend. Clinton edged out Sanders in the competition for delegates. Sanders supporters, meanwhile, protested what they saw as an unfair result, and have subsequently gone so far as to threaten the state chairwoman with physical violence. Fallout from the event continued on Tuesday. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called on both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns to denounce “the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. ” Sanders heeded that call later in the day, though he struck a defiant tone. “There have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization,” Sanders said. “Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a ‘penchant for violence.’ That is nonsense. ” “It goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,” he added. What happened in Nevada could be a harbinger of what’s to come at the Democratic National Convention this summer. For now, it’s another reminder that Democratic party unity might not be easy to achieve.   West Virginia, Kentucky’s neighbor to the east, was a Bernie Sanders blowout. The Vermont senator carried every single county —  quite embarrassing for Hillary Clinton, who beat Barack Obama there in 2008 by a    margin. Kentucky could be different. Yes, it’s an Appalachian state whose eastern counties are heavily dependent on mining, like West Virginia. And nearly ninety percent of its population is white, another advantage to Sanders. But it’s also home to Lexington and Louisville, two   cities with sizable black communities, a bloc that has heretofore favored Clinton. The former secretary of state performed well there in 2008, winning 66 percent of the vote and every rural county. And two months ago —  one of the last times Kentucky was polled —  Clinton led Sanders, 43 to 38. That said, in the same poll, a fifth of Democratic voters said they hadn’t yet made up their minds. Much has changed since then, and with Trump’s impending nomination, the stakes are higher. It’ll be interesting to see which candidate the new terrain favors. Math is hard. There are 55 delegates up for grabs in Kentucky’s Democratic primary today, along with five “unpledged” delegates, who can vote for whomever they choose. Alas —  this does not, as The New York Times, CNN, and others are reporting, add up to 61. The culprit seems to be a July 2015   from the Kentucky Democratic Party of delegate allocation, which says the state has 61 total delegates. But that’s wrong, said Daniel Lowry, the state party’s director of communications. The Bluegrass State will send 60 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. It turns out the mischievous 61 wasn’t just a rounding error. That total counts the governor, Lowry said, who was still a Democrat —  Steve Beshear —  when the original party calculations were made. But when November came, the Republican Matt Bevin defeated his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway. That means Kentucky Democrats will have one fewer representative in Philadelphia this summer than some outlets are reporting. The   days of U. S. presidential primary season have gone. On Tuesday, the people of Oregon and the Democrats of Kentucky will have their say about the candidates, but their ballots likely won’t change much in the race. Donald Trump is the de facto Republican nominee. And Hillary Clinton is well ahead of Bernie Sanders in the delegate count —  she’s at 1, 717, compared with his 1, 437. To add insult to injury, pollsters haven’t been that interested in feeling out Kentucky voters, perhaps because the Bluegrass State’s Democratic primary is so late in the lineup. One March poll put the former secretary of state ahead of the Vermont senator by five percentage points, although those numbers are now two and half months out of date, so take them for what they’re worth. In Oregon, on the other hand, a poll from early May shows Clinton with a significant edge over Sanders —  a    lead, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Both primaries are closed, meaning that only registered Democrats can participate. This might also hurt Sanders, who has had luck nabbing Independent voters elsewhere. The same poll cited by OPB showed Trump with 45 percent of the vote among Oregon Republicans, with little redemption for his   competitors, John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Although both men had already dropped out by the time the poll took place, they each only won the enthusiasm of 14 percent of those surveyed. Oregon and Kentucky are not great predictors of this election in other ways. Both states are far whiter and older than the rest of America. Kentucky is poorer and more uneducated than the national average as well. It will be interesting to see if the Democrats of the Bluegrass State follows in the footsteps of other Appalachian states that recently went for Sanders, or if Kentucky defies regionally tendencies as well. Does this mean Americans shouldn’t pay attention to these states’ primary results? Of course not democracy is sacred. But perhaps that’s not reason enough to follow The Atlantic’s live coverage here, visit our election dashboard, or take a look at the latest GIFs in our presidential cheat sheet. So consider this: At least on the Democratic side, the race is still going. Since delegates get allocated proportionally in both states, Sanders could still increase his count. He’s still probably not going to get enough to win the nomination, but the longer he remains a viable candidate in the race, the more influence he’ll likely have at the Democratic Convention and beyond, as Clare has reported. The voters of Oregon and Kentucky may still have something important to say yet.  —  Emma Green",-0.5
"Famed Ringling Bros. circus closing.  (CNN) The Ringling Bros. circus is closing down after more than 100 years in operation, according to a press release from Feld Entertainment, which has owned the circus for the last 50 years. ”I have made the difficult business decision that Ringling Bros. and Barnum  Bailey® will hold its final performances in May of this year,” CEO Kenneth Feld said. High operating costs and the decline of ticket sales ”made the circus an unsustainable business for the company,” Feld said. And after ”the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop” in ticket sales, Feld said. Before taking the final bow, the Ringling Bros. will perform 30 shows across the United States between now and May.  For years, the elephants have been in the spotlight and their dance routines featured prominently in the shows.  But due to mounting criticism from animal rights groups, the Ringling Bros. phased out the elephant acts entirely.  Off stage, the Ringling Bros. runs an elephant conservation center which sits on 200 acre of rural land in Florida, between Tampa and Orlando. Created in 1995 by Ringling, the facility focuses on the care and study of Asian elephants    an endangered species that it had used in its shows.  Public outcry   But several animal rights groups repeatedly criticized, picketed and sued Ringling Bros. for its treatment of the animals. The animal rights group, PETA, spent years petitioning against the treatment of circus animals.  The Humane Society of the United States, a longtime critic of the show’s animal welfare practices, acknowledged that Ringling Bros. has made changes over the past century and a half, but claims the changes didn’t happen quickly enough.  ”It’s just not acceptable any longer to cart wild animals from city to city and have them perform silly yet coercive stunts,” the society’s President and CEO Wayne Pacelle said in a statement Sunday.  ”I know this is bittersweet for the Feld family, but I applaud their decision to move away from an institution grounded on inherently inhumane wild animal acts,” Pacelle said.  In 2011, Feld Entertainment agreed to pay a fine of $270, 000 to the US Department of Agriculture for alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act.  The company did not admit wrongdoing but promised to implement new training for all personnel who handle animals. Ringling Bros. has made recent changes to its traditional lineup to capture the attention of more attendees.  Just this week, the   female ringmaster, made her circus debut in Orlando, Florida.  The full cast of the circus is between 250 and 300 people. With three performing units, the circus visits about 115 cities each year.  Ringling Bros. was founded in Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1884 by five of the seven Ringling brothers.  The family ran the circus until 1967 when it was sold to Feld Entertainment, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society.",-1.0
"Supreme Court deliberations on execution kept quiet.  (CNN) Late Thursday night as briefs and orders ricocheted through the clerk’s office, the Supreme Court struggled again, at the last minute, with the death penalty.   Two times an execution was temporarily delayed by Justice Clarence Thomas in order to give the justices more time to consider the case. Ultimately, the execution of Alabama inmate Ronald Smith,  was allowed to go forward —  by a deadlocked court.   Chief Justice John Roberts, who in November sided with liberal justices as a courtesy to stay the execution in a similar Alabama death row case, gave no such temporary reprieve to Smith, who was convicted of killing convenience store worker Casey Wilson in 1994. While it takes only 4 justices to agree to hear a case, it takes 5 to block an execution. The   legal drama that unfolded will remain shrouded from public view a justice’s  vote in a motion for stay of execution is rarely explained. Unlike most Supreme Court cases, which are the subject of public arguments and lengthy opinions,   deliberations on death row cases are usually opaque. One law professor calls it the court’s ”shadow docket.”   When Chief Justice John Roberts provided the so called ”courtesy vote” last month he did something rare: he explained why.   ”I do not believe that this application meets our ordinary criteria for a stay,” Roberts wrote, before saying he would vote to delay as a courtesy and to give his four liberal colleagues more time to review the case.   The same four colleagues wanted to delay Smith’s execution, but Roberts issued no explanation on why he didn’t think the case warranted his courtesy vote .   Smith’s case highlights at least two brewing divisions on the court that won’t be publicly aired in the coming days, especially since Smith was put to death at around 11 pm.    First there is the issue of why Roberts didn’t supply a courtesy vote this time around. That lack of transparency raised more questions than it answered late Thursday night.   ”In these shadow docket cases, the Justices don’t write opinions,” said William Baude of the University of Chicago Law School. ”They usually don’t write anything —  they just vote and move on.” Baude has written extensively on the issue in the NYU Journal of Law  Liberty noting that some of the court’s orders ”lack the transparency that we have come to appreciate in its merits cases.” In the merits cases, which have justices have agreed to hear publicly, the court shows its work, dedicating pages to majority opinions and dissents. That doesn’t often happen when the court is faced with an emergency application, such as a stay of execution.   ”While the Court follows regular processes to produce public and reasoned opinions, its internal deliberations are afforded far more secrecy than the other two branches” Baude wrote.   Roberts most likely has very good reasons for choosing not to grant the courtesy vote, but they won’t be revealed publicly.   The second is whether a judge can overrule a jury’s recommendation of life without parole, as happened with Smith.  The Supreme Court  struck down a similar sentencing procedure in a case out of Florida called Hurst v. Florida.    Alabama’s Attorney General, Luther Strange argued that Smith’s petition presented ”an unusually large number of procedural problems” and he noted that Hurst has ”no retroactive application to Smith.”     One more issue involved in the case became relevant during the execution when witnesses say that Smith appeared to be struggling. According to local reports Smith —  who had also challenged Alabama’s lethal injection    coughed and heaved for about 13 minutes.   Alabama’s protocol includes a drug called midazolam that has been linked    in different doses    to botched executions in other cases.   Controversy over the drugs used to kill death row inmates is not new. ”Once again a state conducted an execution that was a failed experiment,” said Dale Baich an Assistant Federal Public Defender in Arizona, who represents prisoners in lethal injection challenges. ”As long as states continue to use midazolam as part of the lethal injection process, there will be more botched executions,” he said noting that the issue is being litigated in Ohio.   Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor at the University of Texas School of Law,  says the unanswered questions provide less clarity to the litigants, the lower courts and the public. ”It complicates any effort to divine some deeper lesson from the Court’s decision —  including whether it agrees with one side on the merits whether some procedural obstacle prevented it from even reaching the merits and so on.”   ”The problem is only exacerbated when the Court splits    because although we at least know the vote, we have even less insight into the underlying reasoning,” he said.",-1.0
"Russian banker who met Kushner has Putin ties.  (CNN) The Russian bank chairman who met with Jared Kushner in December isn’t your ordinary banker. His   bank has been under US sanctions for nearly three years. He was appointed to his job by Russian President Vladimir Putin after eight years at Russia’s biggest   commercial bank.  And he graduated from the Russian academy of Federal Security Service, which trains people to work in Russia’s intelligence and security forces. Sergey Gorkov’s meeting with Kushner, President Donald Trump’s    and one of his closest advisers, will be scrutinized by congressional investigators probing links between Trump associates and the Russian government. Gorkov is chairman of VneshEconomBank, or VEB, a Russian development agency that has been under US sanctions since July 2014. The meeting is raising questions both because of the sanctions and because Kushner spent years as a   developer and was trying to attract financing for a building project of his in Manhattan. The White House said Kushner was acting as a Trump adviser    not as a private developer    when he met with Gorkov.  ”He was a conduit and to    to leaders and that’s until we had a State Department, a functioning place for people to go,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday.   VEB confirmed the meeting with Kushner in a statement to CNN, though described Kushner in his role as head of Kushner Companies, not as a representative of Trump.  ”During 2016 the bank’s management repeatedly met with representatives of the world’s leading financial institutions in Europe, Asia and America . .. including the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner,” the VEB statement said.  A spokesman for the Kremlin said Tuesday the Russian government was not aware of the meeting, calling it ”absolutely the bank’s prerogative” and stressed that the discussion was one of dozens held to discuss the bank’s   strategy. Senate Intelligence Committee member Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN’s ”New Day” Tuesday morning that it was ”interesting” that VEB ”seemed to contradict” Kushner’s statement that he was acting as a campaign official when he met with the bank president.  ”I’m sure that that will be an issue that we’ll try to clarify,” Collins said. Close ties to Russian government, The meeting between Kushner and Gorkov does not violate the US sanctions, and it is not unusual for businesses under sanctions to meet with US officials, experts said. ”I don’t see any problem in having a meeting,” said Paul Saunders, executive director of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, DC, think tank. ”The prohibitions relate to doing business with the banks, not to talking to them.” Trump said during his presidential campaign that he was open to reconsidering the sanctions against Russia. The sanctions weakened much of the Russian finance sector by barring Americans and US companies from buying the debt of Russian financial institutions, which limits their ability to raise money. ”Right after the election, there was an expectation on the part of Russia that sanctions will be lifted,” said Alevtina Guseva, a Boston University expert on Russian finance. VEB is a   Russian corporation formed in 2007 that is closely tied to the Russian government. Its chairman is appointed by the Russian president. The Russian prime minister is chairman of the bank supervisory board. The bank has helped rescue financially troubled oligarchs and has financed infrastructure projects such as the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi that are too risky for commercial banks. Last year, the bank restructured 200 billion roubles (roughly $3. 5 billion) in debts that were affiliated with Sochi projects. It was disclosed on Monday that Kushner agreed to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee for its inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government in its effort to sway the 2016 election toward Trump.  Lawmakers also want to question Kushner about his meeting in December with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in 2014 after Russian annexed part of neighboring Ukraine.",-1.0
"The Trump-Clinton Gender Gap Could Be The Largest In More Than 60 Years. During a recent speech before the National Rifle Association, Donald Trump was explicit about the voters he’s reaching out to: ”I will say, my poll numbers with men are through the roof, but I like women more than men. Come on, women. Let’s go. Come on.” He has every reason to fight for the women’s vote. It’s a safe bet in any given presidential election these days that women will vote more Democratic than men. This year, given Trump’s abysmal poll numbers among women, it looks like an even surer bet than usual. Since 1980, women have consistently voted more Democratic than men have, and since 1992, they have consistently voted  . Here’s how that gender gap breaks down by election. (We used Roper’s exit polls back to 1976, and prior to that, we used Gallup’s final   polls back to 1952.) The latest round of polls suggests that in the 2016 election, those two dots could be farther apart than in any modern election yet. We chose one as an example  —   women chose likely nominee Hillary Clinton 51 to 38 percent in the latest NBC   Street Journal matchup between her and Trump, while men supported Trump 49 to 40. It’s just one (early,  ) poll  —   meaning the numbers could still be very far off from where they will be in November  —   but it suggests the gender gap could be bigger this year than in any election since 1952, and perhaps even earlier. Here’s how those gaps  —   that is, the distance between those dots  —   have looked over time, as well as how they might look, according to that survey, in a   matchup. It’s one measure of just how wide the gender voting gulf is getting. In this latest   poll (as well as a recent   York Times poll) the gender gap is on par with where it was in 2000, when Democrat Al Gore overwhelmingly won women, while George W. Bush won the men’s vote by an   margin. That   York Times poll also found a large gender gap in a hypothetical matchup between Bernie Sanders and Trump. Women favored Sanders by 24 points, but Sanders performed better among men by only 1 point  —   that is, within the margin of error. Likewise, women preferred Clinton over Trump by 17 points, while men preferred Trump slightly, by 5 points. There are other ways to measure the gender gap: for example, you can simply measure the difference between women and men on one party’s candidate  —   that is, the fact that around 55 percent of women voted for Obama in 2012, compared to 45 percent of men (so, a   gap). By that measure, 2012, 2000 and 1996 were all relatively   years, at 10 or 11 percentage points. On that measure again, this year’s election could easily have a bigger gap. This latest poll also shows an   gender gap between both Trump and Clinton. Once again, today’s polls are inherently uncertain for a lot of reasons. After all, there are more than five months of campaigning left. If recent skirmishes between Clinton and Trump are any signal, gender will factor heavily into the candidates’ attacks. Depending on how women and men respectively react to those attacks, the gender gap could widen significantly by November. (Interestingly, it also may not have much to do with Clinton’s gender  —   several studies have shown that gender doesn’t play into people’s votes nearly as much as party.) Indeed, those poll results imply that more than 10 percent of men and women alike didn’t choose Trump or Clinton, meaning some may have yet to make up their minds. Once they do, it could widen the gulf even more. It’s true that Republicans have managed to win the presidency despite deficiencies among female voters  —   George W. Bush did it in 2000, for example (though he didn’t win the popular vote) and then again in 2004, when he lost the women’s vote by less. But this loss of women voters  —   and a potential decrease with white women in particular  —   signals some big weaknesses for Trump. The 2012 election is a great point of comparison here. Though Mitt Romney lost women altogether by 11 points in 2012, he won white women, 56 to 42. In that   poll, Trump currently leads among white women by only 4 points, 46 to 42. True, that leaves 12 percent of those women who haven’t chosen one or the other yet. But Trump would have to win the overwhelming majority of those women in order to beat Clinton among them (unless he wins white men by margins never seen before). Perhaps realizing he has a big deficit among women, Trump has started attacking former President Bill Clinton’s history with women. A recent video Trump released on Instagram includes an audio clip of Juanita Broaddrick, who has accused Clinton of a sexual assault in 1978.",-0.5
"Census Questionnaires May Soon be Offered in Arabic — The Fastest Growing Language in U.S. - Breitbart. Arabic is the fastest growing language in the United States. With steadily people speaking Arabic at home, the U. S. Census Bureau is considering implementing   census questionnaires by 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. [Pew reports that from 2010 to 2014 the number of people in the U. S. who speak Arabic at home grew by 29 percent and is on pace to continue growing. By comparison, the number of   grew by six percent in that   timeframe. Arabic is currently the seventh largest   language spoken in the U. S.  The number of Arabic speakers in the U. S. has skyrocketed in conjunction with the increased immigration to the U. S. from the Middle East and North Africa. Pew notes that the growth in the U. S. Muslim population, which as of 2015 numbered about 3. 3 million and was on pace to more than double by 2050, has also contributed to the rise in Arabic speakers. Given the rapid rise in people who primarily speak Arabic, Pew reports that the Census Bureau is now researching what it will take to include an   census questionnaire for the 2020 Census. Additionally, the Census is looking at the possibility of adding a Middle   Africa category for race and ethnicity questions. As Pew details the Census has already implemented strategies to tally residents who speak Arabic, including a language guide for the 2010 Census. In 2014 the Census counted 1. 9 million residents with Arab ancestry, according to Pew. “Among those who speak Arabic at home, 38% were not proficient in English  —   that is, they report speaking English less than ‘very well,’” Pew reports. “This is comparable to the rate of English proficiency among the 39. 3 million U. S. residents who speak Spanish at home. Some 42% of this group does not speak English very well, according to census data. ” With the Census is considering ways to implement a new Arabic translated Census a recent study detailed a number of challenges including words that might not translate, American spelling of Arabic names, alignment issues (Arabic is read from right to left) and cultural differences in understanding. “Even if the questions are translated accurately, the visual elements of the survey may not necessarily transmit the same meaning as in English,” Pew reports. “For example, symbols such as an “X” to mark a response carry different connotations in different cultures. ”",1.0
"Carrie Fisher to appear without CGI in Star Wars: Episode IX. Carrie Fisher will appear as Princess Leia in Star Wars: Episode IX, her brother has confirmed. Speaking to the New York Daily News at the opening night gala of the TCM film festival in Los Angeles, Todd Fisher said that he and the late actor’s daughter, Billie Lourd, have given Disney and Lucasfilm permission to use recent footage of Fisher in the film.  “Both of us were like, ‘Yes, how do you take her out of it?’ And the answer is you don’t,” said Todd Fisher. “She’s as much a part of it as anything, and I think her presence now is even more powerful than it was, like    —   when the saber cuts him down, he becomes more powerful. I feel like that’s what’s happened with Carrie. I think the legacy should continue. ” Fisher said that he was unsure of the role his sister would play in the film, which has not yet begun filming. “I’m not the only part in that equation, but I think the people deserve to have her,” said Fisher. “She’s owned by them. ” The Daily News report suggests that CGI would not be used to digitally recreate Fisher in the film. In January, Disney was forced to deny rumours that Fisher would be digitally recreated in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, otherwise known as Episode VIII. Previously, the studio had been criticised for recreating the late Peter Cushing’s character of Grand Moff Tarkin in prequel film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. A   of Fisher as a young Princess Leia also appeared in the film. Filming for the    Episode IX is set to begin this July.

"Melania Trump releases letter from immigration attorney.  (CNN) Melania Trump released a letter from her immigration attorney Wednesday aimed at settling questions about whether she properly followed immigration law when she came to the United States in 1996.  ”I am pleased to enclose a letter from my immigration attorney which states that, with 100% certainty, I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, with a photo of the attorney’s letter attached.  Michael J. Wildes, Trump’s lawyer who signed the letter from the firm Wildes  Weinberg, wrote, ”It has been suggested by various media outlets that in 1995, Mrs. Trump illegally worked as a model in the United States while on a visitor visa. Following a review of her relevant immigration paperwork, I can unequivocally state that these allegations are not supported by the record, and are therefore completely without merit.” ”Contrary to published reports, Mrs. Trump never worked in the United States in 1995 because she was never in the United States in 1995,” Wildes wrote, citing immigration documents that demonstrate that Trump’s first entry to the country was in 1996.   The controversy over Trump’s immigration history began in August when the New York Post   photos from an old photoshoot she had done in the 1990s, which seemed to place her in New York City in 1995, despite her claims that she had arrived in 1996. Critics questioned the timeline Trump had provided for her immigration history and whether she had obtained proper legal status. ",-1.0

"Guards for North Dakota pipeline could be charged for using dogs on activists. Private security guards who deployed dogs on protesters at a North Dakota oil pipeline demonstration were not properly licensed and could face criminal charges, according to a local investigation. The Native   protests of the Dakota access pipeline received national attention in September when officers allegedly   activists while guard dogs attacked protesters in a confrontation that was caught on video by the news program Democracy Now! On Wednesday, the Morton County sheriff’s office, which has been leading the police response to the demonstration and conducted mass arrests over the weekend, announced that it had investigated private guards working for the pipeline and determined that “dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of North Dakota”. The disclosure is significant at the continuing pipeline protest, where members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters say law enforcement officers have become increasingly aggressive and militarized, using excessive force against peaceful, unarmed activists and targeting journalists for arrest. Leota Eastman Iron Cloud, a Native American activist from South Dakota who has been at the protests for months, told the Guardian by phone on Wednesday that she was present when private guards brought dogs and mace and went after demonstrators on 3 September. “We are here in prayer, and they came for war,” she said, explaining that she continued protesting even after she was hit with pepper spray. “I can’t believe that people out there can actually do this to other human beings. ” The tribe and other environmental and indigenous rights’ activists have argued that the planned $3. 7bn oil pipeline, which would transport fracked crude from North Dakota to a refinery near Chicago, poses a major threat to the local water supply and to the cultural heritage of the Native Americans. Opponents have challenged the project in court with little success. But the federal government, which provided initial approval of construction, announced last month that it would reassess its decision and delay issuing permits. Police have accused the activists of a range of charges, including criminal trespass, engaging in riots, resisting arrest and assaulting officers. But protesters have argued that they have been consistently nonviolent and that law enforcement has indiscriminately arrested people present at the site, including   and reporters. Security officials told the Morton County sheriff’s office that “there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work” the office said in its investigation report. “However, because of the protest events, the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control. ” The sheriff’s department said there were seven handlers and dogs but that police could only identify two people. Frost Kennels, from Ohio, provided employees and dogs, but police said the company had not been cooperative in the investigation and that it was not a registered security company. “Although lists of security employees have been provided, there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld,” Morton County Capt Jay Gruebele said in a statement. Bob Frost, owner of the kennel that supplied dogs and staff, told the Guardian that he had been “beyond cooperative” and said his handlers were licensed through a security firm acting as a contractor for the pipeline. “All the proper protocols   …     were already done,” he said, adding that it was a different group that had pepper spray. “I pulled my guys out the next day because we weren’t there to go to war with these protesters. ” The sheriff’s office said prosecutors were reviewing the case and the private guards could face misdemeanor charges. Spokespeople for the state’s attorney’s office did not respond to an inquiry and a spokeswoman for the pipeline, operated by   Energy Transfer Partners, declined to comment. It was recently revealed that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has close ties to the pipeline company. Iron Cloud said the conflict with the dogs was harrowing. “I was face to face with the security guards and the dogs,” she said, adding that at the time of the protest, construction workers were “bulldozing sacred ground”.  Private security workers were continuing to monitor them on Wednesday afternoon, she added. “We’re watching them watching us. ” No billionaire owner, no shareholders.

"Mike Pompeo, Sharp Critic of Hillary Clinton, Is Trump’s Pick to Lead C.I.A. - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   Representative Mike Pompeo was once pointedly asked why his committee’s inquiry into the 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, had dragged on longer than the Watergate investigation. He did not flinch. “This is worse, in some ways,” he said, during an appearance on “Meet the Press” in late 2015. A sharp, pugnacious Kansas congressman and former Army tank officer with degrees from West Point and Harvard, Mr. Pompeo was often an unyielding critic of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  —   accusing her of orchestrating a     of the Benghazi attacks. On Friday,   Donald J. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton after a bitter campaign, selected Mr. Pompeo to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Pompeo would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the C. I. A.  —   a spy agency that, at least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policy making. At the same time, the C. I. A. has been central to America’s secret wars waged in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, giving the agency a shadow role in the counterterrorism policy of the past two presidents. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Pompeo (pronounced   ) has used his platform to denounce efforts in recent years to rein in some of the most polarizing counterterrorism programs of the  . 11 era. He has advocated a return to the bulk collection of Americans’ domestic calling records  —   which Congress restricted though legislation last year  —   and he has denounced President Obama’s decision in 2009 to close C. I. A.   prisons and also to require government interrogators to strictly adhere to the rules of the Army Field Manual. After a visit to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2013, he told a congressional committee that a hunger strike by detainees was a “political stunt. ” On Friday, some lawmakers  —   even Democrats  —   complimented Mr. Pompeo’s work ethic and grasp of policy details. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, praised Mr. Pompeo as “bright and  . ” “While we have had our share of strong differences  —   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi  —   I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a C. I. A. director,” Mr. Schiff said. It appears that Mr. Pompeo’s role in the Benghazi inquiry was a significant factor in Mr. Trump’s decision to select him to lead the C. I. A. Some members of the  ’s transition team viewed a competing candidate for the position, former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, as “soft” on Benghazi because Mr. Rogers, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, oversaw a report that they believed was not tough enough on Mrs. Clinton. By contrast, Mr. Pompeo’s relentless questioning of Mrs. Clinton during her October 2015 appearance before the House Select Committee on Benghazi raised his profile in Republican circles. When the committee concluded its work this year, Mr. Pompeo’s position on Mrs. Clinton’s role was an outlier even from most of his Republican colleagues. The select committee found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Mrs. Clinton, but Mr. Pompeo and another Republican member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, said they were convinced that there had been a  . When the committee released its findings in June, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Jordan filed a   addendum that said the attacks showed the State Department was “seemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clinton’s legacy than with protecting its people in Benghazi. ” The chairman of the select committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, did not put his name on the addendum. After graduating first in his class at West Point, Mr. Pompeo served as an armored Cavalry officer and was deployed in Germany during the final years of the Cold War. After leaving the Army, he attended Harvard Law School and was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He arrived in Congress in 2011, after a sometimes bitter campaign against Raj Goyle, a Democratic state representative. During the campaign, one of Mr. Pompeo’s aides promoted an article on Twitter that referred to Mr. Goyle, an   as a “Turban Topper. ” In an interview Friday, Mr. Goyle said that Mr. Pompeo personally apologized to him for the incident, but that the campaign staff member was never fired. “As we are entering an era where relations with Muslim and minority communities in America are extremely sensitive, his record and his approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing,” Mr. Goyle said. Mr. Pompeo has close ties to Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists in financing Republican candidates nationwide. Their company, Koch Industries, and its employees have contributed $357, 000 to Mr. Pompeo since 2009. He has common cause with many senior Republican lawmakers on a range of issues, including a distaste for the agreement the United States and five world powers struck with Iran in 2015 to significantly limit Tehran’s nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. In an   this summer on the Fox News website, Mr. Pompeo wrote that the United States should “walk away from this deal. ” Indeed, some members of the transition team pushed for Mr. Pompeo because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help foster better relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Friday that Mr. Pompeo “will undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with Congress in his new post. ” But some Senate Democrats indicated that Mr. Pompeo could face a difficult confirmation hearing, citing some of his past comments, particularly his praise for the C. I. A. ’s former detention and interrogation program. That program “was ineffective, it was brutal and it stands in direct violation of American values,” Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement. “We can never return to that dark time. ” Ms. Feinstein, a member of the Intelligence Committee, led an investigation into the C. I. A. ’s program that produced a voluminous report  —   most of which remains classified. In her statement, she said she planned “to speak with Congressman Pompeo about this issue during his confirmation process. ”",-1.0

"What it was like to work on a film with Stephen Hawking. What if Stephen Hawking could go anywhere and see anything? Where would he go, and what would he say about it? That’s the premise of Stephen Hawking’s Favorite Places, which I produced. In just 25 minutes, we follow as Stephen talks about the origins of the cosmos, alien life, his own life and our place in the universe. I hope it’s both profound and easy to understand.  Meeting Stephen for the first time, years ago, was a bit overwhelming. Talking to someone who is extremely famous is always a bit   but all the   skills you can usually count on are also gone, since interacting with Stephen takes time. I remember being amazed at how easily his staff communicated with him at first, but quickly realized how they do it: it’s all about reading his face.  The way I work with him has not changed much over the years. I outlined the proposal in basic terms  —   “What if you could visit your five favorite places in the universe? What would they be?” Then you have a long wait as Stephen types his response, a process which can easily take 20 minutes. I studied physics and philosophy at university  —   but dropped the physics, not because I didn’t like it but because I found philosophy to be about thinking itself, which I found fascinating. I’m sure Stephen would not agree with me, as he thinks philosophy is a waste of time.  But before you start to think he is a stern scientist, I have to tell you he can be very funny. I went to a fancy dress party he threw, and the theme was Alice in Wonderland. He went as the Mad Hatter, and he looked great. I went as the King of Hearts and looked ridiculous, but he said I looked “magnificent”. For this documentary, the idea had a strange beginning. Four or five years ago, my daughter was given a science challenge at school. Her task was to ask a real scientist a question and write up the answer. She knew I had worked with Hawking, so she asked if I could ask him a question on her behalf. So I did.  The question was brilliant in the way that children’s questions often are: “What’s your favourite planet?” Stephen replied “Saturn, because it is so beautiful. ” (Obviously, my daughter got a good mark!) Fast forward to last year, and when I was asked if I could think up a cosmology idea for a new documentary, I told the tale about my daughter’s question and there it was. When I went back to Hawking, I had a rough idea of what the five places would be (and obviously Saturn would be one of them) but as usual, there was a surprise. Stephen insisted we pick Santa Barbara as our last choice. He spent a lot of time there over the years and it is his favorite place on Earth, alongside Norfolk. This slight twist gave the documentary’s narrative a great shape. He has a knack for this kind of thing, an instinctive ability to see what will make a good story. I’m enormously pleased with how it all turned out  —   and we were especially delighted when Stephen said he liked the custom flight jacket we had made for the show. He took it home with him. But best of all was when I showed him the final cut, which made him smile and type his usual, succinct response  —   “I like it”.

"Dogs can read human emotions. Many dog owners believe their pets are able to pick up on their moods, but scientists have demonstrated once and for all that man’s best friend can actually recognize emotions in humans. Researchers found that by combining information from different senses dogs form abstract mental representations of positive and negative emotional states in people.  Previous studies have shown that dogs can differentiate between human emotions from signs such as facial expressions. But this is not the same as emotional recognition, according to Dr Kun Guo, from the University of Lincoln’s School of Psychology. ”This is the first empirical experiment that will show dogs can integrate visual and oratory inputs to understand or differentiate human emotion as dog emotion,” Kun told Reuters. Experiments were carried out by a team of animal behavior experts and psychologists at the University of Lincoln, UK, and University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  They presented 17 untrained domestic dogs with images and sounds conveying either positive or negative emotional expressions in humans and dogs.  The dogs used in the testing were unfamiliar with the procedure; avoiding any chance of conditioning. The vocalization sound accompanying the human faces was also unfamiliar. ”We used Portuguese to British dogs so they weren’t habituated with any words, they weren’t familiar with any words. So, we wanted to see if the dogs could assess the emotional content of the human voices and whether they would actually discriminate the emotional information within them,” explained Natalia De Souza Albuquerque, a PhD student in experimental psychology. The results, published recently in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, found that dogs spent significantly longer looking at the facial expressions which matched the emotional state of the vocalization, for both human and canine subjects.  ”What we found is that when dogs were hearing positive sounds they would look longer to positive faces, both human and dog. And when they were listening to negative sounds they would look longer to negative, angry faces,” added De Souza Albuquerque. The study shows that dogs can integrate two different sources of sensory information into a perception of emotion in both humans and dogs. This means dogs must have a system of internal categorization of emotional states. Among animal groups, it’s a cognitive ability previously only evidenced in primates. The researchers believe that the ability to combine emotional cues may be inherent to dogs. As a highly social species, detecting emotions in humans would have helped them in their domestication by people over the generations. Dr Kun Guo now wants to conduct more experiments in a bid to better understand how man’s canine companions decipher human emotions. ”(So) we can see whether dogs can use a   principle or   strategy to perceive, understand and respond to human emotion,” he said. ”If we can understand this, surely we can understand dogs better.” BEIJING China’s launch of a new   rocket, the Long   Y2, carrying what the government said was its heaviest ever satellite, failed on Sunday, official news agency Xinhua said.

" FBI Admits It Urged Change Of Apple ID Password For Terrorist’s iPhone.  The Apple ID password linked to the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino terrorists was changed soon after the government took possession of the device, Apple, San Bernardino County, and federal officials have acknowledged over the past 48 hours. If that password change hadn’t happened, senior Apple executives said on Friday afternoon, a backup of the information the government was seeking may have been accessible. The dispute over retrieving the contents from Syed Rizwan Farook’s phone broke into the open earlier this week, part of the government’s investigation into the Dec. 2, 2015, attacks that left 14 dead. Now, the government, through a court order, is demanding Apple build what the company considers a special backdoor way into the phone  —   an order that Apple is challenging. The government argues Apple would not be creating a backdoor. The Apple executives said the company had been in regular discussions with the government since early January, and that it proposed four different ways to recover the information the government is interested in without building a backdoor. One of those methods would have involved connecting the iPhone to a known   network and triggering an iCloud backup that might provide the FBI with information stored to the device between the October 19th and the date of the incident. Apple sent trusted engineers to attempt that method, the executives said, but they were unable to do it. It was then that they discovered that the Apple ID password associated with the iPhone had been changed sometime after the terrorist’s death  —   within 24 hours of the government taking possession of the phone. By changing the password, the government foreclosed its ability to obtain a fresh copy of the most recent device data via this      method. The FBI had claimed in a court filing on Friday that the password was changed by someone at the San Bernardino Health Department, writing, “[T]he owner, in an attempt to gain access to some information in the hours after the attack, was able to reset the password remotely. ” On Friday night, however, the San Bernardino County’s official Twitter account stated, “The County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBI’s request. ” The County was working cooperatively with the FBI when it reset the iCloud password at the FBI’s request. County spokesman David Wert told BuzzFeed News on Saturday afternoon the tweet was an authentic statement, but he had nothing further to add. The Justice Department did not initially respond to repeated requests for comment. Late Saturday night, more than 24 hours after Apple’s Friday briefing, the FBI confirmed the county’s account in a statement. “The FBI worked with San Bernardino County to reset the iCloud password on December 6th, as the county owned the account and was able to reset the password in order to provide immediate access to the iCloud backup data,” the agency said in a statement. The FBI downplayed the effect of the password reset, however, claiming that it “[does] not impact Apple’s ability to assist with the the court order under the All Writs Act,” and adding that “the government’s objective was, and still is, to extract as much evidence as possible from the phone. ” A senior Apple engineer countered the FBI’s assertions late Saturday night telling BuzzFeed News that the agency’s explanation acknowledged that its changing of the Farook’s Apple ID password prevented the auto backup and that such backups do indeed have value. As such, the engineer continued, the reset closed off an avenue through which the FBI might have been able to gather information. Had this password not been changed, Apple senior executives said Friday, the government might not have needed to demand the company create a “backdoor” to access the iPhone used by Farook, who died in a shootout with law enforcement after the attack. Following up on a court order that had been granted earlier in the week, the Department of Justice filed a motion to compel Apple to create the backdoor earlier Friday. The Apple senior executives spoke with reporters on Friday afternoon to respond to the government’s filing, noting that the government had opened the door to discussion of Apple’s prior efforts in the case by disclosing those actions in its Friday filing. Creating backdoor access to Farook’s iPhone, the executives said, would put at risk the privacy of millions of users. It would not only serve to unlock one specific phone, they said, but create a sort of master key that could be used to access any number of devices. The government says the access being sought could only be used on Farook’s device, but Apple’s executives said that there is widespread interest in an iPhone backdoor, noting that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said Thursday that his office has 175 Apple devices he’d like cracked. Apple’s executives also claimed that no other government in the world  —   China included  —   has ever asked the company for the sort of FBiOS the government is demanding that it build now. Asked why the company is pushing back so hard against this particular FBI request when it has assisted the agency in the past, Apple executives noted that the San Bernadino case is fundamentally different from others in which it was involved. Apple has never before been asked to build an entirely new version of its iOS operating system designed to disable iPhone security measures. The Apple senior executives also pushed back on the government’s arguments that Apple’s actions were a marketing ploy, saying they were instead based on their love for the country and desire not to see civil liberties tossed aside. The U. S. Department of Justice has not yet responded to a request for comment.

"Charity watchdog reportedly places Wounded Warrior Project on its watch list.     The Wounded Warrior Project, the charity for wounded veterans, has been placed on Charity Navigator’s watch list over accusations of using donor money toward excessive spending on conferences and parties instead of on recovery programs, according to CBS News. According to the charity’s tax forms, obtained by CBS News, spending on conferences and meetings increased from $1. 7 million in 2010, to $26 million in 2014, which is the same amount the group spends on combat stress recovery. Charity Navigator is a watchdog organization that evaluates charities in the U. S. Army Staff Sergeant Erick Millette, who returned from Iraq in 2006 with a bronze star and a purple heart, told CBS News he admired the charity’s work and took a job with the group in 2014 but quit after two years. ”Their mission is to honor and empower wounded warriors, but what the public doesn’t see is how they spend their money,” he told CBS News. Millette said he witnessed lavish spending on staff, with big “catered” parties. Two former of employees, who were so fearful of retaliation they asked that CBS News not show their faces on camera, said spending has skyrocketed since Steven Nardizzi took over as CEO in 2009, pointing to the 2014 annual meeting at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs. ”He rappelled down the side of a building at one of the all hands events. He’s come in on a Segway, he’s come in on a horse,” one employee told CBS News. About 500 staff members attended the   conference in Colorado, which CBS News reported cost about $3 million. ”Going to a nice fancy restaurant is not team building. Staying at a lavish hotel at the beach here in Jacksonville, and requiring staff that lives in the area to stay at the hotel is not team building,” he told CBS News. Marc Owens, a former director of the IRS’ tax exempt organizations, was asked to review the charity’s tax documents by CBS News. He told CBS he “couldn’t tell the number of people that were assisted” through the organization. Wounded Warriors Project has been questioned over how it spends more than $800 million it has raised over the last four years, but has strongly rejected the claims of the CBS report.

[“The Washington Post and L. A. Times spent more than a month working on stories that were exclusively about Senator Sessions and race. Their attempt to define him not by his last twenty years in the Senate, but by the notion that he was white, conservative, evangelical, and from the South meant, in their view, that he could not escape the label of being a racist,” said Blackwell.  “They don’t use facts,” he added. “They don’t use measurable, observable behavior and activity. They, in fact, create this false image of a guy who they would like to bring down because they see him as the tip of the spear of moving us back to a system that respects the rule of law   …     that respects the Constitution. ” Blackwell said, “This is an   political attack. This is an effort to misdefine Jeff Sessions in a way that they can destroy him. ” “This is,” he added, “pure and simple, the borking of Jeff Sessions.

" Board Recommends Parole For Charles Manson Follower Leslie Van Houten.  A California review board recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten on Thursday, more than 40 years after she was sent to prison for her role in the murder of a wealthy couple in 1969. The recommendation by the California Board of Parole must still undergo further review before it is sent to Gov. Jerry Brown, who has the final say. He has previously denied parole for another Manson family member, the Associated Press reported. As the youngest Manson follower involved in the string of Los Angeles killings, attorneys for Van Houten have argued that she should face less blame for her actions. She was 19 at the time and under the influence of LSD. Van Houten’s attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, told the AP that she is not a danger to the public and should be freed. “The only violent thing she has ever done in her entire life was this crime and that was under the control of Charles Manson,” he said. “She is just not a public safety risk, and when you are not a public safety risk, the law says you shall be released. ” On Aug. 10, 1969, Van Houten and others entered the Los Feliz home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Van Houten held Rosemary LaBianca down while she was killed, then also stabbed her 14 times. They wrote in blood on the walls and also carved “WAR” into Leno LaBianca’s stomach. The gory double homicide was carried out one day after the killings of actress Sharon Tate and four others, acts of “Helter Skelter” that Manson had convinced his followers would start a race war. “I don’t let myself off the hook,” Van Houten told the parole board on Thursday, according to the AP. “I don’t find parts in any of this that makes me feel the slightest bit good about myself. ” It was the 21st time Van Houten, now 66, had come up for parole consideration since she was convicted of murder. She, Manson, and other followers were initially sentenced to death, then   to life in prison after the death penalty was temporarily abolished in California. Since her incarceration, Van Houten has earned college degrees and shown exemplary behavior, her attorney said. Tate’s sister, however, has argued that Van Houten should never be released. In an online petition, Debra Tate noted that two juries had agreed Van Houten should not be in free society. She was retried after an appeal and convicted of murder and conspiracy in 1978. “Ms. Van Houten should not be paroled and the [parole] board needs to know society cannot trust someone who committed such a heinous murder without showing any remorse for years,” Tate wrote.

"Austria: Far-right nationalist Hofer admits defeat.  (CNN) Austria’s   presidential candidate Norbert Hofer has admitted defeat in an election rerun after exit polls showed an apparent win for his   rival. Hofer’s announcement puts Alexander Van der Bellen in the clear to assume the presidency. Official results have not yet been announced, but exit polls from state broadcaster ORF showed Van der Bellen with 53. 6% of the vote. While the Austrian president’s role is largely ceremonial, the vote was closely watched around the world as a gauge of wider   sentiment following the election of US   Donald Trump and Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union.  ”I am incredibly sad it didn’t work out,” Hofer wrote in a concession statement on Facebook.   ”I would have loved to look after Austria. I congratulate Alexander Van der Bellen to his success and ask all Austrians to stick together,” he added. ”We are all Austrians, no matter what we decided today. Long live our home Austria.” At a press conference shortly after, Hofer told CNN he was  ”very sad” about the result, adding ”he wouldn’t be human if he wasn’t disappointed.”  He hugged his youngest daughter, who appeared to have been crying, and said after the election he planned on ”kicking back, relaxing with my wife and reading ’The Old Man and the Sea. ’” Austria votes for ’freedom, equality, solidarity’  Speaking on Austrian state TV, Van der Bellen credited his apparent victory to ”the engagement of hundreds of thousands” of people.  ”That’s how a big movement developed. I have always campaigned for a   Austria. This is about values: freedom, equality and solidarity. Also to include those that don’t do that well in the current economic system,” he said. ”I will actively speak to all voters, including those of Hofer’s party. They have real concerns that have to be taken seriously by the president.”  Green Party’s significant gains  Van der Bellen’s apparent win marks a significant change to Austria’s political landscape, which has been dominated by two centrist parties since the end of the war. The original presidential vote was held in May, with Van der Bellen, a former Green Party leader, defeating Hofer by little more than 30, 000 votes in a tightly fought contest decided by   ballots. But the results were challenged by Hofer and his party, and were eventually annulled over concerns about how some ballots were handled.  This time around, Van der Bellen’s margin was expected to have increased tenfold, to more than 300, 000 votes, he said in an address on Austrian state TV. ”It was not a rerun but a new election,” Van der Bellen said, adding that voters had been influenced by the changing political landscape over the last six months. ”The world around us has changed. We had the Brexit referendum in Britain and the election of Donald Trump in America,” he said. Van der Bellen said the result sent a ”red, white, red signal (referring to the colors of the Austrian flag) of hope” to other European countries.  Europe reacts, A win for Hofer would have made Austria the first nation with a   head of state in Western Europe since the end of World War II. The leader of France’s   National Front, Marine Le Pen, congratulated Hofer’s Freedom Party for fighting ”with courage.”  ”The next legislative elections will be their victory,” she said on Twitter.  Can Europe survive the Trump effect? Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister   Steinmeier said in a Twitter post that the ”whole of Europe has heaved a sigh of relief” at the outcome. French President Francois Hollande also congratulated Van der Bellen in a statement, saying ”The Austrian people have chosen Europe, and they have chosen to be open.” European Parliament President Martin Schulz tweeted that Van der Bellen’s victory was ”a heavy defeat of nationalism and     populism.” Populist groundswell, Van der Bellen, a    economist whose parents spent time in a refugee camp before settling in Austria, has championed liberal migration policies.  He is an outspoken supporter of gay marriage, and despite his age, he has young fans who organized dance raves in his support. In contrast, Hofer’s party had risen on a populist groundswell sweeping the continent caused by the European Union’s failure to make progress in the ongoing economic and migrant crises. On Sunday, after casting his ballot, Van der Bellen said the Austrian election was ”of significance for all of Europe.”   ”Outside of Austria, the election is perceived as something that does not only concern us Austrians,” he said.  Following his victory in May, which was later annulled, Van der Bellen told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that Europe ”shouldn’t dramatize” the growing popularity of   parties in Europe. There were concerns in Brussels that Austria was on track to become the next ”euroskeptic” state, with Hofer indicating support early in his campaign for a referendum, like Britain’s ”Brexit” vote, on the country’s membership in the EU. But Hofer softened his position on the EU, saying he preferred to stay in a reformed decentralized union.",-1.0
"MaidPro. Maxine Kenefsky learned about MaidPro, a residential and commercial cleaning service, from the inside. In 2000 she was working with the company's founders as the manager and dispatcher for their Boston location. When she decided to move back to her hometown of Seattle, she brought MaidPro with her, but this time as a franchisee. ""I was so excited that I could still be part of this amazing organization,"" she said. And having been part of the team in Boston, Kenefsky knew how much support she would receive from the franchisor. Kenefsky particularly liked that the franchise is fairly inexpensive to get up and running and doesn't require a large office or major investment in inventory. Today she has 70 employees working at her four locations — three in the Seattle area and one in Beaverton, Oregon. The vast majority of her approximately 1,100 clients are residential; word-of-mouth referrals from these customers are her biggest business generator. Having support from the franchisor — which now has 150 locations across the United States — is a huge help, she said. The company provides her with a business coach that has years of experience in the residential and commercial cleaning business that can help her figure out the best ways to schedule jobs, keep employee turnover low and grow her business. As with other service businesses, Kenefsky said one of her biggest challenges is finding and keeping good workers. ""I try to create a good, friendly work atmosphere,"" she said. During the morning dispatch, when workers are being sent out on jobs for the day, she likes to keep the mood light and as stress-free as possible, she added. As for the best advice she could give other would-be franchisees, Kenefsky advised not to try to reinvent the wheel. ""Follow the franchise model,"" she said. ""You're buying a proven system, so use it.""",0.0
"Erdogan Condemns U.S. for Bodyguard Warrants over May Beating: ’What Kind of Law Is This?’ - Breitbart. In remarks from Ankara on Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was harshly critical of the U. S. arrest warrants for twelve of his bodyguards. [“What kind of law is this? If my bodyguards cannot protect me then why am I bringing them to America with me?” Erdogan exclaimed, as reported by Hurriyet Daily News.  Washington, DC, police issued warrants for the bodyguards on Thursday, at a press conference decorated with photos of the men stamped “WANTED” in red. The charges involve assault against protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in D. C. on May 16, during Erdogan’s visit to the United States.  “We all saw the violence that was perpetrated against peaceful protesters, and it’s not something that we’re going to tolerate,” said D. C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. He added that the suspects are all believed to have returned to Turkey and are thus unlikely to land in an American courtroom unless they surrender themselves, but he stated they would be arrested if the ever return to the United States. The U. S. State Department has not ruled out demanding their extradition. In his remarks, Erdogan claimed the protesters were all affiliated with the violent separatist Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) which is the Turkish government’s name for the followers of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, currently a resident of Pennsylvania. The Turkish government insists Gulen is the mastermind behind last year’s unsuccessful coup attempt against Erdogan. “The U. S. police did nothing. Can you imagine what the response would have been if a similar incident had taken place in Turkey?” Erdogan asked, insinuating that the protesters were a threat to his safety. It’s something of a trick question because it is not very difficult to imagine how Erdogan’s security forces would respond to a protest by suspected PKK and FETO members that got within 50 feet him. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry summoned U. S. Ambassador John Bass on Thursday to declare the arrest warrants against Erdogan’s bodyguards “unacceptable. ” The statement repeated Erdogan’s allegations that local security authorities were at fault. “This incident would not have occurred if the US authorities had taken the usual measures they take in similar   visits and therefore that Turkish citizens cannot be held responsible for the incident that took place,” the Foreign Ministry said. The UK Guardian quotes Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Bulent Aliriza, who stressed the Turks are very serious about the matter and worried the U. S. relationship with Turkey could suffer significant damage if the warrants are allowed to stand. “There will be demands for action that may ultimately damage the diplomatic relationship to the point of ambassadors being yanked back, which is unprecedented,” Aliriza said.",1.0
"Clinton on Russian election meddling: ’More effective theft even than Watergate’. New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton referred to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election as an ”act of aggression” on Thursday, in her most extended comments yet about a controversy that has consumed the earliest days of Donald Trump’s presidency. ”I am deeply concerned about what went on with Russia,” Clinton said at the ”Women in the World” summit in New York City. ”A foreign power meddled with our election and did so in a way that we are learning more about every single day.” The Russian hackings, she said, appeared to be a ”more effective theft even than Watergate.” Accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of wanting to ”sow distrust and confusion, as well as influence, our election,” the former secretary of state also said she supports an independent investigation into whether there was collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Russians ”will be back time and time again” if the United States doesn’t take bipartisan ”action together to hold whoever was involved accountable,” Clinton warned. Thursday marked Clinton’s first public interview since Election Day. The      session was conducted by the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof. In front of a friendly audience at a packed auditorium at the Lincoln Center, Clinton was forthcoming about the parallel universe in which she had hoped to be president.  ”You know what? I’m doing pretty well, all things considered,” Clinton said, when Kristof asked how she was doing. The past few months, she said, have been filled with long walks in the woods, spending quality time with friends and family, and at times, convincing herself to ”get out of bed.”   ”The aftermath of the election was so devastating,” she said.  She reflected on what it has been like to observe the climate that has surrounded her former political opponent: ”As a person I’m OK. As an American, I’m pretty worried.” ”I don’t take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning,” she said.  But one moment of dysfunction for the Republican Party was an exception: The GOP’s failure to take a vote on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.  ”You know, health care is complicated. Right?” Clinton said in a jab at Trump. ”That was somewhat gratifying.” Clinton also had sharp words on the situation in Syria, where a chemical attack    believed to be perpetrated by Bashar      killed more than 70 people earlier this week.  ”I really believe that we should have and still should take out (Assad’s) air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.” The lingering disappointment among her supporters in the room was clear. Comedian Samantha Bee, who introduced Clinton onto the stage, said, ”It’s actually hard to know what to say today. I should be lauding Hillary for making time to be here despite her busy schedule as president.” In the immediate aftermath of her loss to Trump in November, the   presidential candidate largely stayed away from the limelight. But in recent weeks, Clinton has appeared increasingly willing to speak out in public, even wading into politics. At a diversity conference hosted by the Professional BusinessWomen of California last week, Clinton took on what she said were ”indignities,” ”sexism” and ”structural barriers” that women confront today.  One person Clinton singled out in that speech: Sean Spicer. The White House press secretary had had a contentious    with American Urban Radio Networks correspondent and CNN political analyst April Ryan, culminating in a condescending request for Ryan to ”please stop shaking your head.” ”She was patronized and cut off as she tried to ask a question,” Clinton said of Spicer’s comment to Ryan. Days after the California appearance, Clinton delivered pointed criticism of the Trump administration. In remarks at Georgetown University, she blasted the President’s budget blueprint, which proposed deep domestic spending cuts and reductions in foreign aid. While Clinton’s closest associates are inclined to reject speculation of the former candidate’s interest in pursuing public office again, rumors have continued to swirl nonetheless. Local media have floated her name as a possible New York City mayoral candidate. Clinton aides say that she is still mulling over what she would like to do in the coming years, and has been reaching out to friends, donors and other associates to keep the lines of communication open. Asked if she would ever run for office again, Clinton said more than once that she is set on finding ”interesting things” to do with her life    without outright rejecting the suggestion of another political campaign. ”I am looking at doing interesting things. I don’t think that will ever include running for office again,” Clinton said. ”I have no plans. I have no plans at all other than trying to find some interesting things to do.”",-1.0
"Democrats pounce on Handel for ’livable wage’ remark. Washington (CNN) Democrats are jumping on Georgia congressional candidate Karen Handel for saying she’s against a ”livable wage” during a debate in the Peach State Tuesday night.  When asked about her position on minimum wage, Handel, a Republican, responded: ”This is an example of a fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative. I do not support a livable wage.” She added that she instead wants ”an economy that is robust with low taxes and regulation.” Despite her   Handel’s comments almost instantly went viral, and groups like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were quick to clip and widely share the moment.  ”Even after 15 years running for office, Karen Handel couldn’t resist admitting she’s against a livable wage,” the DCCC said in an email blast Wednesday. The Democratic Party’s official Twitter account labeled her position ”indefensible” and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the comments prove ”she has no business being in Congress.” Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democrats’ 2016 vice presidential candidate, tweeted, ”I stand for better skills, better jobs, better wages!” Progressive groups, including MoveOn. org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, also highlighted the moment. Handel faced off against Democrat Jon Ossoff for the first time Tuesday night ahead of the June 20 Georgia special election. Ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in April. He received 48. 1% of the vote, shy of the 50% needed to win outright. Polling currently shows a very close contest between the two, with Ossoff leading in some surveys. This is despite a history of Republicans holding the congressional district for more than 40 years. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich at one point held the seat for 20 years. ",-1.0
"Light for the climate: how car colour cuts pollution. Driving a silver or white car is good for the climate. A study a few years ago showed that the interiors of silver and white cars were cooler than black cars. That’s because light colours reflect about 60% of sunlight and make the car’s interior cooler. That in turn means it’s less likely the car’s air conditioner will be turned on, saving fuel and pollution. Scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory experimented by leaving two Honda Civic cars, one silver and one black, in the sun, facing the same direction, for an hour, in Sacramento, California.  Reporting in Applied Energy, they showed that the silver car’s interior was about 5C to 6C cooler than the black car. They calculated that that represented an improved fuel economy of 0. 44mpg, or 2% and that, in turn, would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1. 9% and other exhaust pollutants by about 1%. That may sound a trifling improvement, but translated across the US an improvement of 2% in fuel economy in all cars and vans would save millions of gallons of fuel and corresponding CO2 emissions.  In fact, light coloured cars could be built with smaller air conditioning units that use less fuel and still remain comfortable. It may seem amazing that something so simple as a car’s colour could make much difference to cutting pollution, but the same principle of light colours has long been used for buildings. White roofs keep building interiors cool on hot days, and those cool roofs help cut the energy used for air conditioning as well as reduce the urban heat island effect in cities. ",-0.5
"Bob Dylan’s New Triple Album Reimagines The Classics. Bob Dylan is about to release a triple album of classic songs. These are not his classics  —   Triplicate continues Bob Dylan’s passion for making new recordings of the Great American Songbook. From the list of 30 songs, so many recorded by Frank Sinatra, it’s easy to see Bob Dylan’s love of classic American music and his desire to be a DJ, curator and singer of the great American song from before and not long after World War II. The three discs is thematically titled and arranged: Disc 1: ’Til The Sun Goes Down features songs of life in its autumn days, of memory and time now past. Songs include, ”Stormy Weather,” Trade Winds” and ”September of My Years.” Disc 2: Devil Dolls features songs of fairly hot love and love gone cold, including ”As Time Goes By,” ”The Best is Yet To Come” and ”Here’s that Rainy Day.” Disc 3: Comin’ Home Late begins with a song Frank Sinatra made famous, ”Day in, Day Out,” about love and how the promise of love magnifies the beauty of life and ends with a song Billie Holiday made famous, questioning life’s meaning and finding it in the hopes of love. Triplicate will continue a running investment in classic American songs, following Dylan’s 2015 album Shadows In The Night and last year’s Fallen Angels, both made up of new versions of songs recorded by Sinatra. Personally, I’ll always find this a most curious and unpredictable role for Bob Dylan, its oddness magnified by our current political divide. Having lived through those divided days when his songs were our rallying cries, this unpredictable present tense is surreal for me. Earlier this month we heard Lucinda Williams and Charles Lloyd take up and remake an impassioned version of his ’60s song ”Masters of War.” Today we have Bob Dylan singing ”I Could Have Told You,” a song that came out when Dylan was 13 years old, first sung by Frank Sinatra in 1954. (You can hear that song at the audio player on this page.) Written by Carl Sigman and James van Heusen, it’s a tune about a fleeting love affair with a straying woman. The rendition is sweet, with a lovely pedal steel keeping it sad and filling the role that a string arranger and players would have picked up sixty years ago. Neither I nor anyone else could have told you Bob Dylan would put out a triple album of these tunes when he was 75. Triplicate is set for release in multiple formats including vinyl on March 31. See the album cover and complete track list below: Disc 1  —   ’ Til The Sun Goes Down, Side 1: 1. I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plans2. September Of My Years3. I Could Have Told You4.

"Nike Reveals the ‘Pro Hijab’ for Muslim Athletes - The New York Times. Nike, a company whose brand is estimated to be worth $27 billion, understands the difference apparel can make to an athlete. And like any viable business, it knows the world is full of potential customers. And so in its latest market expansion, the brand has turned to the Middle East, where female athletes have begun to come into their own over the last few years. This week, Nike announced that it would release a Pro Hijab for female Muslim athletes in spring 2018. The hijab, which is expected to cost $35, is made of a lightweight, stretchy mesh polyester and will come in gray, black and obsidian. Throughout several stages of development, the product was tested by a group that included Zahra Lari, the first figure skater from the United Arab Emirates to compete internationally Manal Rostom, a runner and triathlete currently living in Dubai and Amna Al Haddad, an Olympic weight lifter from the United Arab Emirates. The move followed Nike’s release of an Arabic version of its Nike  Training Club app early last year and the beginning of a campaign featuring five female athletes from the Arab region with the tagline “What will they say about you?” last month. “There weren’t any hijabi athletes to look up to when I was growing up, and I had to be my own pioneer, and now girls today have women like Amna Al Haddad and Zahra Lari to look to as role models, which is so inspiring,” Ms. Rostom wrote over WhatsApp. “For young girls to see these women and to see this revolutionary shift will change the face of sport for Muslim Arab girls, whether they wear hijab or not. ” Female athletes in the Middle East are a young but growing group. In the 2012 Summer Games, Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the last three countries competing at the Olympics to send women. That same year, Egypt’s contingent included 37 women, the highest number of female athletes representing the country since it entered the games in 1912. The presence of   athletes like the boxer Arifa Bseiso, the fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad (who became the first hijabi American to compete at the Olympics for the United States last year) and the triathlete Najla Al Jeraiwi has become increasingly common at international competitions. But it was only in 2014 that FIFA, the international soccer organization, lifted its ban on religious headgear. The basketball organization FIBA maintains its ban and has postponed a vote on the matter until May. Beyond bans, there is the issue of comfort. Female Muslim athletes have struggled with finding headgear that will not slow them down or distract them from arduous physical exercise. It was Ms. Haddad’s difficulty in acquiring a hijab that met her requirements for competition  —   namely, that it would not shift when she moved and that it would be more breathable  —   that inspired the Pro Hijab project. “The one obstacle that’s always there if you’re a hijabi is, what is she going to wear on her head?” Ms. Rostom wrote. She explained that she usually buys a special   hijab in Kuwait that is made with polyester and cotton. “Cotton is extremely uncomfortable, especially if you are training outdoors or if you are running long distances, and especially when we live in one the hottest countries in the world,” she said. There are companies that manufacture   hijab, like Capsters in the Netherlands and Friniggi in Botswana, but none of them have as global and as visible a reach as Nike. “For us, we come up with ideas, and ways to be comfortable in what we wear, but to have the No. 1 sport and fitness brand in the world facilitate this process for us?” Ms. Rostom wrote. “To provide something we can grab and wear in 10 seconds? It’s going to change everything. ”",-1.0
"Picturing Queer Africans In The Diaspora. In 1624, as Portuguese colonists were making their way through the east coast of Africa, a woman named Nzinga ascended to the throne of Ndongo (now Angola). She spent decades fighting off invaders, both from Portugal and neighboring African kingdoms, and became a legend among her people and around the world. Nzinga is one of the first people that Mikael Owunna, a     photographer, thinks of when people tell him that queerness is  . ”The thing about Nzinga is her title was Ngola, and Ngola means king,” Owunna said. ”Nzinga ruled dressed in full male clothing as a king, and she had a harem of young men dressed as women who were her wives. So in the 1600s, you basically had a butch queen with a bunch of drag queens for wives leading a fight against European colonization.” Finding historical representations of queerness in Africa is important to Owunna because growing up he was flooded with messages that his sexuality and cultural heritage were at odds. ”When I read that history, I understood really kind of fundamentally that Africans, we have been here. We’ve been at the forefront. And even when you read about the way gender and sexuality are talked about, it’s not just one way. Every different community has a different way to understand gender and sexuality.” When Owunna was unwillingly outed to his family at 15, the solution to what some family members perceived as a problem was to send him from his hometown of Pittsburgh to his parents’ native Nigeria to reconnect with his roots. ”Because the idea was if I get   to my culture, there’s no way that I would be this way,” Owunna said. ”This is an American thing. This is because I grew up in America.” For several years, Owunna traveled to his family’s hometown in Nigeria twice a year. But when he was eighteen, he said through laughter, ”They found out that I was still gay.” The winter after he started college, Owunna was sent to Nigeria again. This time, he was put through what he described as a series of exorcisms to try and change his sexuality. A healer poured hot oil all over his body in an attempt to drive out whatever was making Owunna gay. ”In that context, I felt like I couldn’t be Nigerian and queer, because I was put through so much trauma and abuse,” Owunna said. ”I ran away from everything Nigerian, everything African for years.” But eventually, Owunna started to question the idea that he couldn’t be both queer and African. His current project, Limit( less) pushes back against the belief that being queer is at odds with being African by interviewing and photographing people who embody both identities. Most of his subjects so far live in the United States and Canada, with origins from Somalia to Morocco to Cameroon. Owunna said that working on this project has been a way to link his experience to a larger community. Almost everyone he has interviewed processed similar messages growing up. ”They’d heard that [being queer] is  . That it is not of our culture. It’s a Western thing, it’s a disease from white people. All of these kind of really crazy things that have been taught to us through colonization over centuries.” The perception that queerness is   has been reinforced legally in some countries. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA)   sexual acts are illegal in 33 African countries, and punishable by death in Sudan and parts of Nigeria. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has been quoted as saying that homosexuality could potentially ”disturb the African moral fabric.”   discrimination against LGBTQ individuals became widespread with British colonialism. A Washington Post investigation revealed: ”The idea that the   tolerance towards homosexuality somehow sprang from a western source doesn’t hold. ..Looking at a variety of data on 185 countries, we found that former British colonies are much more likely to have laws that criminalize homosexual conduct than former colonies of other European powers, or than other states in general. For example, 57 percent of states with such a law have a British colonial origin. Almost 70 percent of states with a British colonial origin continue to criminalize homosexual conduct.” Working in the United States and Canada, Owunna and the people he photographs have had the ability to be fairly open about their sexuality and identities. In several of their    the same wouldn’t be true. Nigeria, for example, is one of seven African countries with a law on the books that ”target[s] freedom of expression related to sexual orientation.” Owunna said during interviews with his subjects many described experiencing trauma, hurt or alienation. The lives of the people he works with are complicated, he said. But he has a different vision when he photographs them. ”Despite all of these circumstances, we still are whole individuals and can live full and free lives,” he said. ”What I really specifically try to do with my work is envision what a free world for black, queer, and trans people can look like. So with every click of my camera, I’m trying to capture this sort of emancipatory vision.” His subjects style themselves, and he likes to shoot them in or near their homes. Some of the people Owunna shoots are comfortable in front of the camera. Others are shy. To help get a sense of who they are and what they want to convey, he often spends a full day with each person before taking a single shot. After one memorable shoot, Owunna passed his camera to a woman he was profiling so she could take a look. She was silent for a long time, and then explained to Owunna what she saw in his work. ”She’d been telling herself that her goal was to be a certain type of person in five or seven years,” he said. ”But looking at the photos, she could see that she was already that person that she was envisioning and dreaming to be. She was that person today. That’s when I realized I was capturing something special and magical.” In June, Owunna will bring Limit( less) to Europe, where there are about four times as many African immigrants as in the United States. He wants to explore issues that LGBT African refugees are facing. And he wants to continue to push the boundaries of what it means, and what it looks like to be queer and African today. ”Because Africa has like a billion people,” Owunna said. ”It’s ridiculous that we try to homogenize it. But it comes from colonialism, where the West, Europeans, saw the black body as this mass, this homogenous mass. .. And so we’ve internalized that to be like, ’Oh this is not African. This is not us.’ Whereas being African has always been about abundance and about richness. It’s been about possibility.”",-0.5
"How to play market volatility-—commentary. The unusually turbulent start to trading in 2016 has set the tone for what is likely to be another volatile year. A halt to trading in onshore Chinese shares, rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and the slowest U.S. manufacturing data since 2009 have overshadowed more positive data from the euro zone. Investors will need to remain vigilant for signs of deterioration in the prospects for global markets, with credit spreads, global economic indicators, the Chinese renminbi and the Middle East in particular focus. But for now, the fundamental situation has not altered enough to warrant a change in investment positioning. In China, the 7-percent slump in onshore equities appears to have been led by technical factors, as government efforts to prop up the market in the summer of 2015 lapse. In particular, a rule preventing investors who hold more than 5 percent of a company's free-float stock from selling is scheduled to expire on Friday, having been in place since mid-2015. This may have driven some retail investors to sell stock now, ahead of possible larger institutional sell orders later in the week. Mixed economic data may have also contributed to the poor sentiment. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell below expectations, signaling the 10th consecutive month of contraction. Still, the data did not mark a significant deterioration, and the services PMI pointed to the highest level of activity since April 2014. Other measures, such as retail sales, remain robust. The soft tone was reinforced by U.S. economic data that showed the manufacturing sector slowing to its weakest pace since 2009. That said, the details of the report were more favorable, with production and new orders components both edging up. In the euro zone, Markit's manufacturing PMI hit its highest level since April 2014, with every country in the zone registering rising output and job creation in December. At a global level, service sectors continue to perform well, while manufacturing remains troubled. China's growth is slowing, but it is transitioning toward a consumer-led economy. Growth in the developed markets is uninspiring but positive. The sharp decline in oil prices is creating dislocations in some credit markets, but ultimately should benefit consumers. Emerging markets remain beset by political concerns and issues with their cost of financing, but the malaise is not translating into crisis. However, we clearly acknowledge that the market's assessment of potential downside risks, most particularly with respect to China, has changed. Consequently, the price the market is willing to pay for future earnings has, for now, fallen. A key transmission mechanism between market uncertainty and fundamental economic factors is the change in credit market pricing. Weakness in oil markets is leading to higher credit spreads for energy-linked companies. There are signs — in the U.S. in particular — that this could spread beyond the energy sector. And disappointments in growth or policy accommodation in China could lead to a higher pace of debt defaults and restructuring across global emerging markets. In our base case, we expect an only modest rise in U.S. high yield defaults, and we believe that markets provide sufficient compensation for downside risks, while in the euro zone, accommodative European Central Bank policy should keep credit conditions favorable. We remain overweight in European high yield credit on a six-month view. However, we will watch for signs that higher corporate borrowing costs, in both developed and emerging markets, are having a lasting negative impact on growth. Another key concern is the Chinese renminbi. In our base case, we expect it to weaken, but only modestly, toward 6.80 against the U.S. dollar in 12 months. In this scenario, we do not believe that the yuan would act as a major driver for financial markets. However, a key risk to this view is the possibility that a disorderly depreciation of the Chinese renminbi, or uncertainty over its management, drives greater regional currency volatility and global deflationary pressure. With respect to the Middle East, we do not believe this latest rise in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran is sufficiently severe to alter the outlook for global oil markets in 2016. That said, investors will need to continue to monitor the situation in case of a more serious deterioration in relations. Overall, we are keeping our positioning unchanged and believe that global growth will ultimately support current valuations, and even an additional appreciation of riskier assets. However, further deterioration in credit spreads, currency moves in China, and developments in the Middle East are areas where we see a heightened need to monitor for risks.

"Hillary Clinton Warns Of Trump’s ’Para-Military’ Deportation Force - Breitbart. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is trying to raise fears of deportation. During a campaign event today, Clinton described what she calls Donald Trump’s proposed “deportation force. ”[“I want you to think about that deportation force for a minute, where we would have police,    —   whatever his deportation force consists of  —   raiding homes and workplaces across America,” she said.  Clinton told the story of a young girl named “Carla” who had a heart condition. Clinton said it was the result of living in “constant fear” that her parents would get deported. She said the fear was “making her heart beat dangerously fast,” according to doctors. “So when Donald Trump talks about deporting 11 million immigrants, he’s talking about ripping apart families like Carla’s,” she said. Clinton made her remarks during a speech to union workers today at The United Food and Commercial Workers Union in Las Vegas. She reminded the audience about Trump calling illegal immigrants “rapists,” asserting that his was a “wrong and dangerous vision” for the United States. “We have to stand up for hard working American families and that includes hard working immigrant families,” she said as the crowd cheered. During her speech, Clinton declared that “we’re coming to the end of the Democratic primaries” and thanked Sen. Bernie Sanders for raising issues about unaccountable money in politics and income inequality. But she urged the Democratic party to come together to stop Trump. “We are going up against a candidate who will say anything, do anything to take us backwards on every issue and value we care about,” she said. Clinton argued for equal pay for woman and paid time off asserting that shortchange women in the work place was bad for America’s families. She repeated that if fighting for those issues meant she was playing the woman card: “Deal. Me. In. ” “I happen to believe that’s a winning hand my friends!” she concluded.",1.0

"U.S. retaliates for Putin’s move to cut U.S. embassy staff. The U.S. will force Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and reduce its presence in Washington, D.C. in retaliation for Vladimir Putin's decision to compel the U.S. to cut its embassy staff in Russia by 755, the AP reports. The State Department said the move came ""in the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians."" The tit-for-tat began when Barack Obama expelled 30 suspected Russian spies and closed to Russian diplomatic compounds in December over Russia's election meddling. Putin's move came in July, after Congress passed sanctions against Russia. Asked about the forced cuts on August 10, President Trump praised Putin's decision: ""I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down on payroll, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll. There's no real reason for them to go back.""",0.0
"For Alabama Christians, Governor Bentley’s Downfall Is a Bitter Blow - The New York Times. MONTGOMERY, Ala.  —   As governor, Robert Bentley would quote the Bible before the Alabama Legislature and say that God had elevated him to the State Capitol. In his dermatology practice, in the city where he was a Baptist deacon, he sometimes witnessed to patients. And when he was a   candidate for statewide office, his campaign headquarters were often filled with volunteers from local churches. This is a state that knows well how mixing faith and politics can lead to disappointment. When Mr. Bentley on Monday resigned from office and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in the wake of the sex scandal that ended his   marriage, his downfall reflected both enduring and contemporary challenges for evangelical voters. To many of the conservative Christians who unexpectedly propelled Mr. Bentley, a Republican, into power, his demise was a dispiriting setback in an age when they feel their values are under siege. “We’re sorry for him and his family, but at the same time, he made his choices and did what he did,” said the Rev. Joe Godfrey, the executive director of the Alabama Citizens Action Program, a   group that holds substantial influence in the Legislature. “I don’t know that people feel had I think they feel disappointed. Here was a man who had a chance to accomplish great things, and he failed. ” But others said it had become clear that for conservative Christians, the cultural and political issues that define modern conservative politics mattered at least as much as moral piety. That was why, they suggested, Mr. Bentley was able to cling to his job for nearly 13 months after his reputation as a paragon of probity came under fire. “The idea that moral hypocrisy hurts you among evangelical voters is not true, if you’re sound on all of the fundamentals,” said Wayne Flynt, an ordained Baptist minister and one of Alabama’s   historians. “Being sound on the fundamentals depends on what the evangelical community has decided the fundamentals have become. At this time, what is fundamental is hating liberals, hating Obama, hating abortion and hating   marriage. ” When Mr. Bentley ran for governor in 2010, Christian voters saw extraordinary promise in the obscure lawmaker from Tuscaloosa who liked to tell people about how Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach, had been one of his patients. He seemed oddly ordinary, the politician who was thought to be   for a state increasingly frustrated by decades of corruption in Montgomery. “People were looking for something that was more grandfatherly, something that was more wise and trustworthy and less politically slick,” said Angi Stalnaker, who was Mr. Bentley’s campaign manager. “They wanted someone that they could see themselves having Sunday dinner with, and, of the candidates in 2010, Robert Bentley was the one you could see inviting over for fried chicken and cornbread. ” He won that election, and then another in 2014. But Dianne Bentley filed for divorce the next year. Months later, an ousted state official accused Mr. Bentley of having an affair with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, a top aide and former beauty pageant contestant whom he had taught in Sunday school in Tuscaloosa. Lurid audio recordings became public, and on Friday, a special counsel concluded that the governor had committed an array of misdeeds to try to cover up the “inappropriate relationship” that had led to Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason leaving their congregation. Ms. Mason declined to comment, and the governor quit hours after impeachment hearings began. His abrupt exit  —   he failed to mention to reporters that his resignation was a condition of his plea agreement  —   spurred a new round of pain for Christians who had spent years supporting him. “I think he’s just like all of us: He’s made of flesh and bone, and he’s temptable,” said the Rev. John Killian, a former president of the Alabama Baptist State Convention. “I believe it was the devil, and I believe the devil knew he was bagging big game. ” Mr. Bentley’s public demise, Mr. Killian said, held lessons. “There is nothing Governor Bentley’s done that any of us couldn’t do if we’re not on guard,” he said. “People always saw him as a godly man. They’re disappointed, yes, but honest people need to realize we’re all susceptible. ” Some evangelical voters, who are part of one of Alabama’s most powerful voting blocs, have already begun considering whether they should change how they scrutinize candidates after a governor they regard as a bitter letdown. “I would hope they’d be more cautious,” said Roy S. Moore, who was suspended as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for his resistance to   marriage. “Sometimes, politicians take advantages of that attention to morality and they will profess things they don’t actually stand for. ” Mr. Moore, who was one of Mr. Bentley’s rivals in 2010 and is considering another run for governor, said that voters were willing to look beyond indiscretions that happened before politicians took office. Once in power, though, the standards shifted, he said. “Once you get into office, they’ll judge you,” said Mr. Moore, who draws much of his popularity from evangelical Christians. In Decatur, Bob Allen, a doctor, said he would be looking for candidates to take actions effectively proving their religious convictions. “Those issues are important to me, but their record and character and integrity over time are more important than what they say,” said Dr. Allen, who twice voted for Mr. Bentley and said he hoped the former governor would repent. “Things like this are going to happen because people are imperfect,” he said. Even before Mr. Bentley’s resignation, there was a budding movement among religious conservatives here to combat malfeasance in state government that has extended well beyond the governor’s office. Mr. Bentley’s departure could strengthen that effort, Mr. Flynt said, even as he noted that he was startled by the   response of evangelicals to the governor’s troubles. “Secular culture is eroding evangelicalism to the point where it takes us one full year to get rid of the governor because of all of these conflicting pressures,” he said. “He would have been out the door in an hour in the 1940s. ”",-1.0
"Trump to Focus on Supreme Court Nominee, Other Judicial Vacancies After Inauguration - Breitbart.   Donald Trump may use his list of 21 judges for potential Supreme Court nominee picks as a guide for appellate judges as well, according to Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer. [Asked by a reporter about who will be nominated to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat on the Supreme Court, Spicer pointed to the list of judges produced by the Trump campaign during the election. Trump has vowed to take his Supreme Court nominee from the list.  “I would look to that list first for individuals, not just for the Supreme Court, but I think we’re going to have a lot of vacancies at the appellate level as well,” Spicer responded, noting, “That would be a good starting point. ” The   and his team have had people reach out to share additional names, Spicer added.

"David Sweat: I grew frustrated with breakout partner.  (CNN) After convicted murderers David Sweat and Richard Matt pulled off their brazen escape from an upstate New York prison, their relationship quickly began to sour, according to a law enforcement official briefed on Sweat’s interviews with investigators.   Sweat has told investigators that Matt, who was fatally shot last week, was out of shape and unable to keep up with him, the law enforcement official told CNN on Wednesday. In particular, Sweat told investigators, he was irked that the older man began getting drunk after they broke into a cabin, the official said. The discord prompted the fugitives to split up.  After a border patrol agent caught up with and killed Matt on Friday, authorities said officers could smell alcohol on his body from a few feet away, according to a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation. From his hospital bed in Albany, Sweat has been revealing details about the prison break and their time on the run that seem to baffle almost everyone    except himself.  Sweat and Matt pulled off the sensational escape not once, but twice, the inmate told investigators.  Through it all, Sweat was the mastermind, or at least that’s what he’s telling authorities, a local district attorney said. And while authorities initially spoke of the possible use of power tools in the escape, Sweat has said that he and Matt actually found a sledgehammer in an underground passageway. It was probably left behind inadvertently by a construction worker, according to the law enforcement official briefed on his interviews. The men supposedly used the sledgehammer to break down a brick wall on their way out of the maximum security prison, the official said.   During their time on the lam, the fugitives had several close calls as authorities closed in, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie told CNN. While hiding in the hunting cabin, they heard voices of people nearby at one point. And after the pair split up, Wylie said, Sweat saw a law enforcement officer walk right by him as he hid in a tree stand used by hunters. An escape before the escape, Sweat said the plot to break out of Clinton Correctional Facility actually started in January, Wylie said.  After five months of hashing out strategies, Sweat and Matt made a practice run.  One night before prison tailor Joyce Mitchell was supposed to meet them at a manhole, Sweat and Matt escaped from their cells, a New York state official said.  They navigated a maze of tunnels and pipes before popping out of a manhole. But Sweat said they saw too many houses near that manhole and decided to try for a different one the next night, Wylie said. So why didn’t the guards notice? It’s not clear, but the state inspector general’s office has been looking into whether guards had fallen asleep, officials told CNN. Just hacksaws, Speculation has raged over what power tools the pair used, but Sweat told investigators that he and Matt used only hacksaws to cut through their cell walls and a steam pipe inside the prison, the district attorney told CNN. After interviewing Sweat for several hours over the past two days, state police investigators had no plans for now to speak with him further, spokesman Beau Duffy said.   Duffy did not have information on where Sweat will go once he’s released but said he will be turned over to the corrections department. Sweat is listed in fair condition and is expected to remain at Albany Medical Center for at least a few more days, according to the hospital.  Mitchell, the prison tailor, has admitted to smuggling hacksaw blades by hiding them in frozen hamburger meat and then having the meat delivered to Matt, a law enforcement official said last week.  She has been arrested and charged with promoting prison contraband and criminal facilitation. Another employee, Gene Palmer, is accused of taking the meat to the inmates. He’s charged with promoting dangerous prison contraband, two counts of destroying evidence and one count of official misconduct.  Was prison security really maximum? A dozen prison employees put on leave, But the investigation extends beyond Mitchell and Palmer    and well beyond the escape. Three members of  the prison’s executive team, along with nine security staff employees, have been placed on paid administrative leave as part of the review of the escape, said the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Superintendent Steven Racette and Deputy Superintendent Stephen Brown are among the executives on leave, a state official told CNN on Tuesday. The other is First Deputy Superintendent Donald Quinn, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Michael Kirkpatrick, a former first deputy superintendent of the Elmira Correctional Facility and head of the Corrections Emergency Response Team, on Wednesday was named the new superintendent of the Clinton Correctional Facility.  Since the escape, other measures have been taken:    Every cell at Clinton is being inspected once a week, with supervision from a senior security staff member.     The number of cells searched daily and randomly for contraband has tripled, with each cell being searched at least once every two months.      All tunnels are being inspected monthly instead of biannually.    The   ”honor block,” where the escaped prisoners had been housed, has been eliminated pending further review, according to the department.     First on CNN: FBI investigating possible corruption at New York prison, The FBI is investigating possible broader corruption at the prison, law enforcement officials briefed on the case said. Agents are looking into whether drug trafficking or other criminal behavior among employees and inmates took place, officials said.  Some employees who have been questioned told investigators that there was heroin use among prisoners and an alleged drug trade involving employees. How the plan derailed, According to Sweat, officials said, this is how the plan was supposed to play out: Sweat and Matt would come out of a manhole and meet Mitchell, who would drive them away. The convicted murderers would then kill Mitchell’s husband, Lyle, before fleeing to Mexico. Sweat has told investigators that it was Mitchell’s idea for them to kill her husband, according to the law enforcement official briefed on his interviews. But her attorney denied that accusation Wednesday. And Mitchell has also told authorities that Matt and Sweat hatched the plan to kill her husband.  In his interview, Sweat also denied any sexual contact with Joyce Mitchell and said it was Matt who had a sexual relationship with her, officials said.  Authorities have said that Matt had a sexual relationship with Mitchell, and that she had been investigated in the past for an inappropriate relationship with Sweat that led corrections officials to move him out of the tailor shop where she worked.  The night of the escape, Mitchell did not show up, forcing the fugitives to improvise on the run for more than three weeks.  Police caught up with and killed Matt on Friday. Two days later, an officer shot and wounded Sweat less than two miles from the Canadian border.  Sweat told investigators that he was upset when he learned that Matt had been killed and decided to try to make it to Canada, the official said.  Matt’s family members at first had said they wouldn’t claim his body, but they changed their minds, Franklin County Coroner Brian Langdon told CNN. Langdon believes the body will be turned over to Matt’s son. The Heald Funeral Home in Plattsburgh will handle the body’s transfer, Langdon said. Matt’s body is at Alice Hyde Medical Center’s morgue in Malone. How prison guards go bad, A timeline of the New York prison break",-1.0
"FCC votes to block internet privacy rule | TheHill. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday voted 2-1 along party lines to block a new internet privacy rule from taking effect. The rule would have required internet service providers to take more stringent steps to protect consumers' personal data. The provision was part of a larger set of broadband privacy rules passed by the FCC in October under the Obama administration and set to go into effect on Thursday.  The measure called for broadband providers to take ""reasonable"" measures to ensure the security of customer data. But critics said that it would have set up different requirements than privacy rules issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and acting FTC Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen issued a joint statement arguing that privacy should be returned to the FTC's jurisdiction.  “We still believe that jurisdiction over broadband providers’ privacy and data security practices should be returned to the FTC, the nation’s expert agency with respect to these important subjects,"" they said. ""All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, enforced by the same agency.""  The temporary stay will be in place until the FCC votes on a reconsideration of the rules. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat on the commission, blasted the vote on Wednesday, issuing a dissent. ""If a provider simply decides not to adequately protect a customer’s information and does not notify them when a breach inevitably occurs, there will be no recompense as a matter of course,"" she wrote. Clyburn also cited a court decision last year that hamstrung the FTC's ability to enforce privacy protections, and she argued that there is now no agency to ensure consumers' data is secure. When the FCC passed its landmark net neutrality rules two years ago this week, it reclassified internet service providers as common carriers. In August 2016, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the FTC could not regulate service providers like AT&T when it came to privacy issues. Updated: 6:20 p.m. View the discussion thread.

"Hasselblad’s X1D puts other medium format cameras on notice – TechCrunch. Back in June of last year, I previewed the Hasselblad X1D. Then, it was a pre-production model, which I had hoped would launch and become the powerful mirrorless medium format camera that it is now. Back in June of last year, I previewed the Hasselblad X1D. Then, it was a pre-production model, which I had hoped would launch and become the powerful mirrorless medium format camera that it is now. First and foremost, the costs associated with a 50 megapixel medium format camera is something only a professional hardware (or a studio) could actually consider. But if you are in the market for a mirrorless 50MP camera, this could be the perfect fit. However, if you’re not and are just curious as to what you can do with a 50MP camera, then keep reading. It only took a few photos for me to realize: you can’t use the X1D like you would other mirrorless cameras. At least, not for all the same scenarios. When in use, the X1D is processing  8272 × 6200 pixel images, at an average of 1.7 to 2.3 frames per second. Actually, now is a good time to list off specs, for clarity. [gallery ids=""1486791,1486792,1486788,1486787,1486789,1486790,1486796""] It’s a lot of work, but also highlights what scenarios you’ll be able to shoot with the X1D: landscape, urban settings, subject photography, etc. Action stills, sports and just about anything that moves quickly will usually be out of your range, simply because you won’t be able to shoot consecutive stills fast enough. When you figure that out, it’s easier to make adjustments and have a better idea of what scenes you’ll best be able to tackle. Shooting with the X1D is very much like “taking screenshots” in real-life. 					


One of my favorite features of the X1D is its colors: they’re 16 bit, with dynamic range up to 14 stops. This really matters most in editing, where a 50MP RAW image and the manner in which it reacts to changes in Lightroom is entirely different from most other cameras. As Veanne, our East Coast producer, put it: “There’s so much more information and details to work with.” All the shots seen here are unedited, with the exception of resizing down so you don’t have to wait for a 120MB file to load. [gallery ids=""1488769,1488761,1488764,1488762,1488765,1488760,1488773,1488763,1488766,1488767,1488768,1488759,1488770,1488771,1488772,1488774""] With the lens hood on and the Spring sunshine, most of my outdoor photos came out exactly how I envisioned them. For most of my time with the X1D, I exclusively shot in Manual mode, occasionally trying out the Shutter and Aperture priority modes. The f/3.5 30mm lens that my demo unit came which was useful for most of the situations the X1D is suited for (nothing moving fast, all stationary and at short to medium distance). As of publication, the X1D has only four XCD class lenses available — and they’re all prime lenses — but zoom, wide angle and one more prime lens is coming out later this year. With the lens hood on and the Spring sunshine, most of my outdoor photos came out exactly how I envisioned them. I’d say that the X1D is very rewarding to the kind of photographer who plans a shot beforehand; shooting with the X1D is very much like taking screenshots in real-life. But like anyone who takes too many screenshots and deletes them due to lack of storage, the X1D fills up SD cards like it’s nothing. On average, a 16GB card holds 140 images. However, due to my shooting in both JPG and RAW file formats, I’d often get less than that. Hence the dual SD card slots being useful for shooting just JPGS or RAWs, or both formats on the same card(s). Regarding video, the 1080p HD capture is decent and eclipses most other mirrorless full-frame cameras, but isn’t its strong suit. The built-in stereo microphone is prone to wind disruption (like most other built-in mics) and doesn’t really pick up voices in an intimate manner. Don’t buy this camera if you’re only looking to use its video mode; that would be silly. My two-week X1D test did not go without gripes. The battery, a 3,200mAh one to be exact, usually lasted only as long as the SD card did, before it was full. If you use the live view function, kiss your extra shots goodbye; the same juice-guzzling energy consumption applies to video. The battery takes an hour or so to fully charge, so it’s best you buy an extra. Thankfully, it’s easy to swap out: slide the latch, press down on the battery and it’ll slide out. The battery takes an hour or so to fully charge, so it’s best you buy an extra. Now a few words on heat: considering the sheer amount of processing going on, I expected the side of the X1D with the SD card to get slightly warm. This was always the case if I took more than 20 photos. What I didn’t expect was for the heat to spread to other areas, like near the dials, grip and the lens. This is only something I noticed and isn’t a deal breaker by any means, at least I don’t think so. All in all, I’m impressed and satisfied with the X1D. This isn’t the camera you’d go out and use for your next vacation, but if you do, send me some pictures. The X1D will be best suited for those specialist, professional photographers who find everyday use for 50 megapixels and never went that route because of the sheer size and weight of most medium format cameras. If mirrorless cameras like the Sony Alphas solved the problem of unwieldy full-frame DSLRs for pros, then the X1D does the same for medium format photographers.

"Boston doctors, engaged to each other, slain in luxury apartment.  (CNN) Two Boston doctors, engaged to each other, were found dead in their penthouse apartment, according to law enforcement. Richard Field, 49 and Lina Bolanos, 38, were anesthesiologists at   practices, according to the couples’ respective employers. Their bodies were found Friday. Police arrested Bampumim Teixeira, 30, after receiving 911 calls reporting a person with a gun on Dorchester Avenue in South Boston. Officers who confronted Teixeira in a dark hallway in the building believed he either pointed or fired a weapon at them and as a result discharged their own firearms, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley.  After a ”violent struggle,” according to police, he was arrested and taken to the hospital.  Teixeira was charged with two counts of murder and his attorney pleaded not guilty to both charges during an arraignment. He will be held without bail.   A backpack full of jewelry, During Teixeira’s arraignment in his room at Tufts Medical Center, Suffolk Chief Trial Counsel John Pappas provided new details about the alleged slaying. Pappas said that Boston police received two 911 phone calls    one from the front desk at the luxurious Macallen Building in South Boston where the couple lived to report that it had received a concerned call from a friend of Field, and the other call from the friend himself. The friend allegedly received a text message from Field saying that he was in trouble and that there was a gunman in his apartment. When police arrived, they entered the penthouse apartment and performed a sweep. They encountered Teixeira and a gunfight ensued, wounding Teixeira in his left hand, abdomen, and leg.  After Teixeira was detained, police entered the apartment and found Field and Bolanos dead. They also found a critical piece of evidence    a black backpack in a ”conspicuous” location full of jewelry, according to Pappas.  In a press briefing Monday, Conley said the black bag was not in Teixeira’s hand when he was shot. He added that at least one knife was found at the scene. During the   arraignment, Teixiera’s eyes were closed for most of the hearing, though he was able to respond with   answers.  An ”enormous loss” Field and Bolanos were   anesthesiologists. Field was instrumental in founding North Shore Pain Management, according to a statement from the staff there. ”He was a valued member of the medical community and a tremendous advocate for his patients,” North Shore Pain Management said in a statement on its website. ”His tragic and sudden passing leaves an inescapable void in all of us.” Bolanos was a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, according to the clinic’s CEO, John Fernandez. ”Dr. Bolanos was an outstanding pediatric anesthesiologist and a wonderful colleague in the prime of both her career and life,” he said in a statement. ”We will do all we can to support their families and our staff members who are processing this senseless tragedy and grieving an enormous loss.” Josh Golden, the owner of Luxury Residential Group, says that his company regularly works with the Macallen building to sell units and recently sold the penthouse across the hall from the couple’s unit. He said the two were ”very sweet and accommodating” during that process. ”We’re shocked by the incident,” Golden told CNN. The building has high security, including security cameras in the lobby and a   concierge, Golden said. Additionally, access to the elevator for its penthouse level is regulated by a key fob, Golden said.  Motive still unclear, There is currently no evidence to point at any connection or relationship between Teixeira and the doctors, Conley said. He added that they are looking in to any kind of employment Teixeira may have had in the area and how he was able to access the doctors’ home. Teixeira has two previous larceny convictions, according according to Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office spokesman Jake Wark. In the summer of 2016, Teixeira passed a note demanding money at a bank.   The second, virtually identical incident, which remained unsolved until Teixeira volunteered the information to law enforcement after his 2016 arrest, took place in August 2014 at the same location. Teixeira pleaded guilty to both crimes and was sentenced to a term of 364 days, with nine months to serve and the balance suspended for a   probationary term, according to Wark. No weapon possession or injuries were reported as a part of either incident. A motive is still under investigation, he said. Teixeira will appear in court on June 8 for a probable cause hearing.",-1.0
"Trump Honors Fallen Warriors At Arlington National Cemetery. Donald Trump made his first Memorial Day remarks as president, paying tribute Monday to fallen U. S. service members, and thanking their families for their sacrifice. ”Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love, or the totality of their courage. We only hope that every day we can prove worthy, not only of their sacrifice and service, but of the sacrifice made by the families and loved ones they left behind,” Trump said. ”Special, special people,” he added. The sun broke through the clouds as the president’s motorcade crossed Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River on the way to the cemetery. A   salute greeted him on his arrival. A somber Trump, clad in a dark blue suit buttoned over a light blue striped tie, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, and paused for several seconds with his eyes closed, and his hands still on the wreath, before stepping back and standing at attention while a U. S. Army bugler played taps just a few feet away. The president then climbed the steps above the tomb to the cemetery’s marble amphitheater, where he delivered his address. ”Here at this hallowed shrine, we honor the noblest among us, the men and women who paid the ultimate price for victory and for freedom. We pay tribute to those brave souls who raced into gunfire, roared into battle, and ran into hell to face down evil,” Trump said. He paid special tribute to two soldiers who died in Afghanistan, Army Capt. Andrew D. Byers of Colorado Springs and Christopher D. Horton of the Oklahoma National Guard. Their family members wept as the audience gave them a standing ovation. Trump recognized former Sen. Bob Dole, who was severely wounded in action during World War II. Dole, 93, rose from his wheelchair to acknowledge the applause. The president also thanked Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, whose son Robert was killed in Afghanistan in November 2010. After his speech, Trump visited Robert Kelly’s grave in Section 60 of the cemetery. During that visit, the president greeted other families who had lost loved ones. He accepted a yellow rose from Alison Malachowski, whose son, Marine Staff Sgt. James Michael Malachowski, is buried in Section 60. Trump also paused to talk to a young boy dressed in a crisp Marine uniform.    Christian Jacobs’ father, Marine Sgt. Christopher Jacobs, died during military training exercises in Twentynine Palms, Calif. in 2011. The boy was visiting his father’s grave with his mother, Brittany Jacobs.",-0.5
"America Can’t Be Rebuilt on the National Level. Nationalism and socialism are in full gallop in America today while conservatives are without a horse. Donald Trump almost never uses the language of traditional American conservatism, with its emphasis on classically liberal notions of limited government, constitutionalism, individualism, and free trade. He prefers to talk about “strength” and “winning” while vowing to restore the “greatness” of yesteryear through his indomitable will. Indeed, this is what unites Clintonism, Sandersism, and Trumpism: the idea that the government in Washington is too weak. Get the right person in the White House and they’ll fix all our problems by bringing the malefactors to heel. They also all believe, as Trump says about health care, that the federal government has to “take care of everybody. ” All of these ideas and impulses have popular support. Millennials, recent polls show, are remarkably cool to capitalism and dismayingly receptive to socialism. The demographic base of the GOP  —   older white voters  —   agrees with Trump that entitlements should be left alone. Given the hollowing out of civil society  —   caused by family breakdown, economic dislocation, declining volunteerism and church attendance, and the growth of the welfare state  —   documented by social scientists like my American Enterprise Institute colleague Charles Murray and Harvard’s Robert Putnam, it shouldn’t be surprising that millions of Americans are looking to Washington for the sense of community traditionally found closer to home. Still, these visions leave millions of traditional conservatives and committed libertarians without a natural home in either major political party. Leaving aside the question of tactical voting to keep Clinton from wrecking the Supreme Court, the challenge facing conservatives and libertarians is larger than Trumpism. Yuval Levin points to a solution: denationalize our politics. Levin, the editor of National Affairs, argues in his brilliant new book The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism, that both parties are besotted with nostalgia for the   century. Conservatives tend to stress the social cohesion of 1950s America (or its seeming renaissance under Ronald Reagan) while liberals yearn for the economic security of the 1960s. Although they have different goals, leading Republicans and Democrats alike want to go back to the way things were  —   and they think they can take us there from Washington. Trump says he’ll cut deals in the Oval Office that will make America great again Clinton promises “universal” everything (education, retirement, health care) to restore the American Dream. Levin argues that this is folly. The institutions that work best in   America are those that give us choices. No one simply lives in the United States of America. We live in Peoria, Harlem, and Seattle. The virtues built close to home, Levin argues, are those that make us good citizens and ultimately draw us together. What would be so terrible about letting diverse communities decide how they want to live and spend their tax dollars? The culture wars would still rage, but at least the winners would have to look the losers in the eye. As it stands now, the federal government, mostly through unelected judges and bureaucrats, thinks it can best determine how more than 300 million people should live. The cure for powerlessness is power, not ceding even more of it to Washington. This is the only way to cut the Gordian knot choking our politics, and the best path forward for opponents of statism  —   in all parties.,",1.0
"Woman Who Streamed Boyfriend’s Death by Police Faces Unrelated Assault Charge - The New York Times. By narrating the raw aftermath of a police shooting in a widely shared Facebook Live video last year, Diamond Reynolds turned the death of her boyfriend, Philando Castile, into a nationwide call for racial justice. Now Ms. Reynolds, who was widely praised for her poise during the video, is facing legal troubles. Ms. Reynolds, of West St. Paul, Minn. was charged with felony assault last week, stemming from accusations that she attacked a woman with a hammer. The police said Ms. Reynolds, 27, was among a group of women who “jumped” a woman at 10:30 a. m. in St. Paul. She was freed on bail after a court appearance on Monday. Her lawyer, Michael Padden, said she intended to plead not guilty at her next court appearance on April 3. The woman, who is 24 but whose name was not included in the criminal complaint, told the police that while waiting at a stop sign, she saw a white S. U. V. make a   to follow her. She said she drove to a parking lot and got out of her car, at which point Ms. Reynolds ran up and punched her in the head while another woman, Chnika Blair, 18, grabbed her by the hair, the police said. At one point, Ms. Reynolds struck the woman in the head with a hammer, knocking her to the ground, the police said. Ms. Reynolds then struck the car’s windshield with the hammer, smashing the window, the police said. A third woman, Dyamond Richardson, 25, got out of the car, chased the woman down and sprayed her with mace, the police said. Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson were also arrested. The woman identified Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Blair and Ms. Richardson out of three separate photo lineups, the police said. The woman showed officers a Facebook post by Ms. Reynolds in which she threatened to “come after” her, the police said. Ms. Richardson told investigators there was an ongoing conflict between her and a friend of the unnamed woman, according to the complaint. The death of Mr. Castile, a    school cafeteria worker, was one of several shootings last year that focused the nation’s attention on police treatment of  . He was shot by an officer while inside a car at 9 p. m. in Falcon Heights, a small city northwest of St. Paul. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office said he died about 20 minutes after he was shot. The encounter was made even more chilling by Ms. Reynolds’s anguished but calm commentary during her   Facebook video, which began soon after Mr. Castile was shot. As her    daughter watched in the back seat, she walked viewers through her account of what happened, saying she informed officers that he had a gun and that he was reaching for his driver’s license and registration when the officer opened fire. Her account was laced with emotion  —   “Stay with me,” she pleaded to Mr. Castile  —   but she also had the wherewithal to repeatedly call the officer “sir. ” The video was viewed millions of times, serving as a window into the personal effects of violence not often seen. The officer who shot Mr. Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, was charged with   manslaughter in November. He pleaded not guilty in February and his trial is scheduled to begin on May 30. Activists began calling for black men and women to stream their encounters with the police live so others could watch for mistreatment. Since the shooting, Ms. Reynolds has been rattled by insomnia and panic attacks, she told The Washington Post in November.",-1.0
"Amazon isn’t the only tech company getting tax breaks – TechCrunch. Amazon has a big target on its back these days, and because of its size, scope and impact on local business, critics are right to look closely at tax breaks and other subsidies they receive. There is nothing wrong with digging into these breaks to see if they reach the goals governments set in terms of net new jobs. But Amazon isn’t alone here by any means. Many states have a big tech subsidy story to tell, and it isn’t always a tale that ends well for the subsidizing government. In fact, a recent study by the watchdog group, Good Jobs First, found states are willing to throw millions at high tech companies to lure them into building in their communities. They cited three examples in the report including Tesla’s $1.25 billion 20-year deal to build a battery factory in Nevada, Foxconn’s $3 billion break to build a display factory in Wisconsin and the Apple data center deal in Iowa, which resulted in a $214 million tax break. Good Jobs First executive director Greg LeRoy doesn’t think these subsidies are justifiable and they take away business development dollars from smaller businesses that tend to build more sustainable jobs in a community. “The “lots of eggs in one basket” strategy is especially ill-suited. But many public leaders haven’t switched gears yet, often putting taxpayers at great risk, especially because some tech companies have become very aggressive about demanding big tax breaks. Companies with famous names are even more irresistible to politicians who want to look active on jobs,” LeRoy and his colleague Maryann Feldman wrote in a Guardian commentary last month. While these deals are designed to attract the company to an area and generate jobs, that doesn’t always happen. The Apple-Iowa deal, for example, involved 550 construction jobs to build the $1.3 billion state-of-the-art facility, but will ultimately generate only 50 full-time jobs. It’s worth noting that in this case, Apple further sweetened the pot by contributing “up to $100 million” to a local public improvement fund, according to information supplied by the company. One thing many lay people don’t realize, however, is that in spite of the size, cost and amount of real estate of these mega data centers, they are highly automated and don’t require a whole lot of people to run. While Apple is giving back to the community around the data center, in the end, if the goal of the subsidy is permanent high-paying jobs, there aren’t very many involved in running a data center. It’s not hard to find projects that didn’t work out. A $2 million tax subsidy deal between Massachusetts and Nortel Networks in 2008 to keep 2200 jobs in place and add 800 more failed miserably. By 2010 there were just 145 jobs left at the facility and the tax incentive lasted another 4 years, according to a Boston.com report. More recent deals come at a much higher price. The $3 billion Foxconn deal in Wisconsin was expected to generate 3000 direct jobs (and another 22,000 related ones). That comes out to an estimated cost of between $15,000 and $19,000 per job annually, much higher than the typical cost of $2457 per job, according to data in the New York Times. Meanwhile states are falling all over themselves with billions in subsidies to give Amazon whatever its little heart desires to build HQ2, which could generate up to 50,000 jobs over a decade if all goes according to plan. The question, as with the Foxconn deal, is whether the states can truly justify the cost per job and the impact on infrastructure and housing to make it worth it? What’s more, how do you ensure that you get a least a modest return on that investment? In the case of the Nortel example in Massachusetts, shouldn’t the Commonwealth have protected itself against a catastrophic failure instead of continuing to give the tax break for years after it was clear Nortel wasn’t able to live up to its side of the agreement? Not every deal needs to be a home run, but you want to at least ensure you get a decent number of net new jobs out of it, and that there is some fairness in the end, regardless of the outcome. States also need to figure out the impact of any subsidy on other economic development plans, and not simply fall for name recognition over common sense. These are questions every state needs to be considering as they pour money into these companies. It’s understandable in post-industrial America, where many factory jobs have been automated away that states want to lure high-paying high tech jobs to their communities, but it’s still incumbent upon officials to make sure they are doing due diligence on the total impact of the deal to be certain the cost is justified in the end.",0.0

"Why Christo Cancelled an Epic Public Artwork. “I use my own money and my own work and my own plans because I like to be totally free,” Christo told the Times. “And here now, the federal government is our landlord. They own the land. I can’t do a project that benefits this landlord. ” Rags Over the Arkansas River sounded a prompt triumphant note. The organization, which exists exclusively to oppose the artwork planned by Christo and his     declared their   mission accomplished. The end of Over the River means the end of the road for Christo and   at least in the U. S.: It was the couple’s last work planned here, their final collaboration in a career of public, socially engaged artworks stretching back 50 years. Christo’s decision to renege on this final work is the most dramatic example yet of an artist action against President Trump. Earlier this month, the mercurial photographer Richard Prince disavowed a portrait he made of Ivanka Trump (based on a selfie from the First Daughter’s own Instagram account) claiming that he had returned the $36, 000 he received from Trump for the piece. Dozens of artists, curators, and cultural workers joined a strike on January 20, the day of President Trump’s inauguration. Christo’s strike may stand alone, however, as an example of an action that truly redacts an artwork from the world, not just notionally. Over the River was a work in progress: One federal lawsuit remained in the way of the artist’s plan to suspend 1, 000 silvery fabric panels in stretches over a   span of the Arkansas River. The work had overcome several obstacles, most recently in January 2015, when a federal district court upheld a U. S. Bureau of Land Management decision to allow the project to proceed. In the divisive world of Christo and   the civic debates were always the locus of their art. Running Fence, a 1978 film by Albert and David Maysles —  documentarians who chronicled the artists’ works —  showcases the many community hearings that served as the pair’s secret medium. The film showed the absurd lengths to which the artists went to persuade skeptical (and sometimes hostile) California ranchers to let them hang 24. 5 miles of white nylon fabric in an undulating line drawn inland from the Pacific Ocean. Christo and   spent 4 years convincing the ranchers why they should bother the final consummation of the project, Running Fence, ran its course for just two weeks in 1976. Over the River was grander in its ambition. The piece, conceived in 1992, required significant   from the U. S. Department of the Interior. As part of the approvals process, Christo and   produced in 2011 a   Environmental Impact Statement, a preparatory document usually reserved for   infrastructural projects. The Sierra Club condemned the artists’ plans the Phillips Collection, a museum in Washington, D. C.  exhibited the draft federal document. By withdrawing from Over the River, Christo has done more than cancel an ongoing project. He has walked away from the fight that made the artists’ work so compelling. For nearly half a century, he and   generated hundreds if not thousands of hours of community hearings,   arguments, and public harangues over the meaning of art. The pair identified public debate as vital to art —  much more so than the installations themselves, which were always rendered in industrial materials and never lasted much longer than a fortnight. The purpose of The Gates was not to festoon Central Park with thousands of orange curtains, but to force the government of New York City to talk about art for more than 25 years. The permitting debate over The Gates, which were raised to great fanfare for a few weeks in February 2005, started way back in 1979, under Ed Koch’s administration. Christo’s Over the River protest, then, comes as a decisive statement. After spending most of his life arguing with people, trying to convince ordinary citizens of the virtue of submitting their consent and their property to the absurd, the artist is saying that the other side cannot be reached. Christo and   often fought in vain against NIMBYism, but sometimes, they broke through in epic fashion, reaching across the aisle, in a sense, and finding common ground. Christo is far from the first artist to say that common ground no longer exists, but with   he spent a lifetime proving otherwise.",-0.5
"U.S. Blocks Syrian Rescue Worker From Attending the Oscars - The New York Times. Khaled Khatib, a Syrian rescue worker who served as a cinematographer on the   documentary short “The White Helmets,” has been barred by American officials from traveling to Los Angeles for Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering “derogatory information” about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied. Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was also to attend the Oscars there was no indication that his plans were upended. Mr. Khatib had planned to attend the ceremony after the Trump administration’s travel ban was lifted.

"The patriotism of fighting Trump.  (CNN) On the day that Donald Trump made news by openly inviting Russia to intervene in the presidential election, the Democrats in Philadelphia reminded America what true patriotism is. For months, Trump’s ”Make America Great Again” slogan has been not just the heart of his campaign, but also the reflection of the wounded pride of his followers: in the Rust Belt, in Appalachia, among uneducated white men who feel ”ripped off” by the world. Trump’s brand of patriotism is strikingly, even shockingly, about decline and loss. It does not strike any of the mystic chords of memory that Lincoln touched and Reagan struck again. It does not evoke our nation’s founding ideals. It is just a vision of    a promise that if an unashamed swindler can become a wealthy celebrity then America must still have a chance. Wednesday night’s speakers offered a different story about patriotism. It started with Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, who have served their country in office and in uniform, and who as citizens now are fighting to reduce the gun violence that almost took her life. It continued with Vice President Joe Biden, who rekindled a spirit of   pride in America based not on fear or resentment or a sense of decline, but on resilience and toughness. Biden did something no other speaker had done to that point: He spoke in anger. He was not just offended or indignant about Trump’s words and deeds. He was angry that this fraud and possibly even traitor would dare lay claim to   loyalties. The narrative about true patriotism rolled on with former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, once a Democrat and then a Republican and now an independent, who delivered the line of the night: ”I’m a New Yorker. I know a con when I see one.” Bloomberg’s pitch, devastatingly effective, was explicitly about putting country above party.  It continued with vice presidential pick Tim Kaine’s spirit of humility and message of service before self. His pride in his son, a Marine who’s just deployed to Europe, was palpable. As was his   corniness, which played as earnest, uncynical belief in the country. But ultimately, the spirit of true patriotism was best expressed and embodied, as it was 12 years ago at this convention, by Barack Obama. ”Filled with faith” in America is how he described himself. He contrasted that belief in American ingenuity and decency with the pessimism and   fearfulness that Trump feeds on. He contrasted the ”We” of ”We the People” with Trump’s ”I alone.” He quoted Teddy Roosevelt. And he painted Hillary Clinton in these colors of patriotism properly understood. Join us on Facebook. . Over a century ago, a U. S. senator from Missouri came to national prominence in a time of nativism and fear. His name was Carl Schurz. He was a German immigrant. He had been a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. When demagogues chanted ”My country, right or wrong,” Schurz replied with a profound twist. True patriotism, he said, means, ”My country: when right, to be kept right when wrong, to be set right.” The United States thrives when citizens of both parties think and act this way. On Wednesday night, Americans who happen to be Democrats reminded us again how to do it. ",-1.0
"'Women's March' feminists want entitlements, not equality | TheHill. March 8 is the latest installment of the trendy new thing among liberals — organized protests against the Trump administration. Sure, America has a history of valiant (and not so valiant) protests and we even have an enumerated right to “peaceably assemble.” But ever since the inception of Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s campaign and especially since his November 2016 election victory and January 2017 inauguration, liberals have organized protests so frequently that there is now an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to documenting them. So what’s happening this time? The short answer is nothing new and certainly nothing important. But if you ask the group of women that organized the inauguration weekend Women’s March, they will tell you they are calling for women to skip work today, March 8, 2017, and strike in protest of the Trump administration “and his aggressively misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, and racist policies.”   It’s the new wave of militant feminism. Like the January march, this latest demonstration is seeking to capitalize on the trendy protests that garner media attention and assert the liberal narrative that Trump’s administration does not value “women’s rights.” This is absurd. Nothing about the Trump administration or its policies to date have remotely suggested that women are valued less or do not have the same rights or legal protections as men. In fact, Trump’s own campaign manager was the first woman to manage a winning presidential campaign and his cabinet and group of advisors include multiple successful women. So why the outrage over women’s rights? ""No success story ever began with someone taking a day off of work."" #WomenAtWork #IWorkFor #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/kpL7PIrD6z As a woman myself and someone very concerned about preserving and protecting fundamental rights, I have to ask, what exactly defines “women’s rights?” Historically, this meant that women should have the same legal, social, and governmental privileges as men. This is what women traditionally meant by equality — literally, having equal status. But in the past few decades, this idea of women’s rights has evolved to mean some sort of additional, special rights or privileges that position us above men, categorically. Though feminists won’t admit it, this isn’t actually equality. It’s playing governmental favoritism and demanding to in fact not be equal. Feminism has gone from demanding equality to demanding entitlements. Moreover, why should women be entitled to take a day off of life in all its grand responsibilities to prove we’re equal to everyone else who isn’t entitled to take the day off? That’s an internally inconsistent assertion. But liberal women often assert the inconsistent role of being an “empowered victim.” We first resign ourselves to victim status — that is, claiming we’re being treated unfairly and inequitably by society (i.e. “the patriarchy”) and demand entitlements and reparations — and then simultaneously assert we are empowered and actually better than men because of our awareness. If these women placed truly equal value on both ourselves and also the males in our society, we would not want entitlements or preferential treatment on the basis of gender. We would simply work (maybe not take a day off men don’t get to?) and work hard at being the best at what we do. Imagine the outrage if men organized a similar protest — A Day Without Men. They would be snubbing women and our rights and be labeled misogynistic chauvinists. Or worse. Perhaps the ultra-feminist would simply laugh and say, “We don’t need men!” Militant feminism also suggests that fathers should not have any say in abortion decisions, which again is not actually equality, but giving preferred legal status to women. It’s the exact opposite of the patriarchy and everything women originally protested about the patriarchy. Liberation of women has come at the expense of men’s equality. Women’s rights as a movement began to seek equal treatment, which is fundamental fairness and equitable standing under the law, but we have gone from being equal to demanding preferred status. “Vogue” even suggested ways that men can support this latest women’s strike. But the feminists don’t really care about any of this. They want their entitlements and they want them now. They’re even willing to oust women who disagree with their extreme positions and definitions of “women’s rights.” We can’t buy into the hypocrisy and inequality. The best way women and men can support genuine rights for women is to truly be equitable and treat women with as much value as men. Not more, not less. And we certainly don’t need another march over it. Dr. Jenna Eilis is an assistant professor of Legal Studies and Leadership at Colorado Christian University.

S. women. “The political class in Washington D. C. works itself up into a feigned indignation about things that don’t actually affect the lives of the American people,” said Stephen Miller. He went on: I think it says a lot about the conscience of Washington D. C. how many hours we’ve spent discussing a retweet. And it would be nice if   the outrage that has been spent in feigned indignation over this retweet had instead been spent this summer when Kate Steinle was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco. Congress did nothing when an American citizen was murdered and died in her father’s arms in cold blood. Miller explained that the political class in Washington D. C. gets mad about the wrong things. Miller then proceeded to list issues that should actually be a source of righteous indignation: “We don’t get mad when Americans are murdered by illegal immigrants, we don’t get mad when people have their jobs taken by cheaper foreign workers here on visa programs, we don’t get mad when entire cities are crushed by our trade policies that send jobs overseas  …     So I think a big part of the Trump campaign is that people want to get mad about the right things. ” Miller continued: It’s a choice that the political class makes in D. C. in terms of what they want to focus on  …     It is a trivial issue to be debating retweets when it is a fact that you have Americans dying every single day as a result of our immigration policies. You want to talk about women’s issues? Here’s something we should be talking about. This is a fact: as a result of uncontrolled migration into this country —   you can look this up, this is a statistic from Equality Now  —   half a million U. S. girls in this country are at risk of female genital mutilation. The fact that half a million U. S. girls are   of female genital mutilation as a result of   Muslim migration has been widely documented by publications ranging from NPR, to ABC, to Reuters, to Newsweek, to the Daily Beast, to the Huffington Post, to the Atlantic, to the New York Times.  As the New York Times wrote in February of 2015, “Genital Cutting Cases Seen More as Immigration Rise. ” As Newsweek reported in February of 2015, immigration is “the sole factor for the rise in numbers”: More than half a million women and girls in the U. S. are at risk of undergoing FGM in the U. S. or abroad, or have already undergone the procedure, including 166, 173 under the age of 18, according to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB). Immigration to the U. S. from African and Middle Eastern countries —  where the practice of FGM is a deeply entrenched cultural tradition —  is the sole factor for the rise in numbers, says Mark Mather, a demographer at PRB who led the data analysis. There has not been an increase in the practice happening in the U. S. itself, he says  …     African immigration to the U. S. has doubled every decade since 1970, with more than 1. 8 million   people now living in the U. S. according to Census data. Immigrants from Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt, all countries that perform FGM( also known as female circumcision) accounted for 41 percent of total African immigrants. According to the latest numbers, nearly one in five girls at risk for FGM in the U. S. are from Egypt, which tops Somalia as the most   country  …     Immigration to Western countries where FGM is not traditionally practiced means health care providers have had to adapt to the harmful medical consequences of FGM. While this statistic has been widely reported, it is almost never mentioned on major television news programming on corporate media. Indeed, not only was the CNN panel unaware of the fact that half a million U. S. girls are   of suffering the barbaric practice of having their external genital organs removed, but one panelist —   a   feminist —   bizarrely sought to deny the veracity of the report and cover up the gruesome reality facing hundreds of thousands of U. S. girls. “This is exactly what happens with Donald Trump,” said Neera Tanden, a   feminist and president of the Center for American Progress. “He says something outrageous. ” Miller pushed back: “You don’t think that statistic is correct?” Tanden said that she did not believe the statistic was accurate: “No, I don’t think half a million girls. ” On her twitter page, Tanden describes herself as, “progressive, Indian American, feminist, mom, wife. Not in that order. ” While Tanden was quick to attack Miller’s   statement, it is unclear from the exchange how her decision to enable the violent practice against women  —   by casually dismissing its prevalence  —   comports with her values as a “progressive  …     feminist. ” The Atlantic has described how the procedure is carried out: It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form —  infibulation —  almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl’s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used. In 2012, Al Jazeera recounted the experience of one London woman: Aissa describes how her sister was taken away by a woman to “wait for her turn” while Aissa’s stepmother instructed her to lay down on a bed. Aissa did as she was told, as four women stood over her pinning her to the bed as another woman began to cut her. No anaesthetic was used to remove Aissa’s clitoris with a razor blade. Aissa explains that it doesn’t matter how tightly you are held down, your body instinctively convulses, which results in deeper and longer incisions. ‘The pain is, well, it’s so difficult to describe to you what it is like. Imagine when you cut your finger, it’s a million times worse than that. But that doesn’t even begin to describe the type of pain that takes over when the part of your body that has the most nerve endings in it is cut away. Only girls who have been cut will ever know what that level of pain is like. I honestly thought I was going to die, and then everything went black.’ However, on Sunday’s panel, Tanden pushed back against Miller’s claim by suggesting that Donald Trump’s tone remains a more pressing women’s issue than the physical assaults and murders carried out by migrants against U. S. women: The fact is that if we actually want to fight sexism in America I agree with Doug that the wrong way to go is Donald Trump, who judges women on their looks, who says terrible things about women in every way he could possibly do, and the reality is that the reason why he’s losing women in the general electorate, the reason why independent women, young conservative women say they will never support Donald Trump is because of what he does every day. The CNN panel also included Nina Turner, a former state Senator in Ohio. On her Twitter page, Turner describes herself as a “wife, mother, sister” and “fighter for the people. ” According to the Population Reference Bureau, over 24, 000 girls in Ohio are at risk of Female Genital Mutilation. Despite the rise of the misogynistic practice in her home state  —   which has emerged solely as a result of unchecked Muslim migration  —   Turner did not express support for Trump’s proposal to temporarily pause Muslim migration during the panel. Nor did Turner praise Trump for his decision during a recent GOP debate to highlight the hostile attitude towards women promoted by Islam. The CNN panel also included political class operative Doug Heye, the former deputy    for communications to failed House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Cantor was defeated in a crushing primary election due to his support for mass migration. During the CNN panel, Heye  —  whose former boss pushed immigration policies that would have resulted in greater violence against American women  —   made clear that what really offended him morally was the idea of supporting Donald Trump for President: “I’ll never be a Donald Trump supporter,” Heye said. During the panel discussion, Miller further addressed the economic effects of immigration and highlighted how Trump’s position on immigration and trade differs from that of Sen. Ted Cruz: In 2013, Sen. Cruz pushed an amendment to the Gang of Eight bill which would have actually doubled immigration including Muslim migration. And if you look at polling, by a    margin, Americans —  Democrats, Independent, Republican, black, white, Hispanics —   by a    margin agree that we should raise wages for people already living here instead of importing more foreign workers. So that’s a very mainstream issue. So if you look at really two issues that Cruz has been very aggressive on —  pushing more foreign workers, and pushing offshoring and more   free trade deals —  he is far outside the mainstream of the GOP and the American electorate. So we think we’re going to do very well in Wisconsin by focusing on trade and immigration issues that appeal to the broadest swath of the electorate.   OO. ready( function()  ) })",1.0
"Colorado Judge Rules Against ’Faithless’ Electors Seeking to Block Trump Presidency - Breitbart. Denver, Colorado District Judge Elizabeth Starrs has ruled against the state’s “faithless” electors who sought to defy the voters’ will by using Electoral Votes for Hillary Clinton to prevent   Donald Trump from ascending to the White House. [The judge reportedly warned they could face criminal charges if they defy her court order.  “If [presidential electors] take the oath and then they violate the statute, there will be repercussions,” Starrs said in an order from the bench, according to the Denver Post. The phrase “faithless” electors refers to individuals who break away from the party’s pledged candidate and who refuse to vote for their state’s choice candidate. In this case, Hillary Clinton won Colorado and gained nine Electoral College votes. Judge Starr’s order means those nine electors must vote for Clinton and could face replacement, and possibly jail time, if they fail to do so. The electors in each state will meet and cast their votes for the president and vice president on separate ballots on Monday, December 19. Judge Starr’s ruling was in response to two Democrats among the state’s nine electors who had sued in an attempt to be freed from laws binding them to vote for the candidate who won their state’s popular vote, so they could join other Republican electors who are allegedly attempting to block Trump. Judge Starr’s court order reportedly also granted authority to Colorado’s Republican Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace electors  —   collectively referring to themselves as the “Hamilton Electors” movement  —   who violate the law. (The phrase “Hamilton” Electors is a reference to Alexander Hamilton’s argument in Federalist No. 68 that the Electoral College would be a special, elite deliberative body: “A small number of persons, selected by their   from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. ”) Some of the “faithless” electors are taking cues from Harvard University constitutional law professor and former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Larry Lessig, who is offering   legal counsel to Republican electors who are considering blocking Trump, through his     known as the “Elector’s Trust. ” On Tuesday, Lessig claimed that he has up to 20 Republican electoral college voters who plan on voting against Trump in order to block his confirmation as America’s 45th president, saying, “We now believe there are more than half the number needed to change the result seriously considering making that vote. ” However, only one “faithless” Republican Electoral College member, Chris Suprun of Texas, has publicly declared that he would vote for someone other than Trump. Texas state law does not mandate that the electors vote for the winner of the state.  To block a Trump presidency, 37 electors would have to vote against him. A person needs to achieve 270 votes to win in the Electoral College. Trump has won 306 Electoral College votes. Clinton won 232. Lessig’s claims contradict the assertions of sources within the Republican National Committee who reportedly say they are calling and monitoring the social media accounts of electors who are in question. Although a few Republican electors have been critical of Trump, they still intend to vote for him. Oklahoma GOP elector Charlie Potts, for example, told Politico, “I would prefer that another person had been nominated by the Republican Party and had won the election, but am I going to go against 14 million [primary voters] who voted for Trump? And am I going to vote against all the people in Oklahoma who voted    for Trump? No, that’s just stupid. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz",1.0
"Facebook Deletes Page of Swedish Immigration Critic, Reactivates It After Backlash - Breitbart. Facebook has made clear yet again that it will not allow certain ideas on its platform after it deleted the page of a Swedish expert for the Gatestone Institute who wrote an article criticising European migration policy. [Ingrid Carlqvist, Gatestone’s Swedish expert, posted a video on the site called ‘Sweden’s Migrant Rape Epidemic,’ which laid out the facts and statistics following the influx of millions of migrants throughout the continent.  The video was in fact a summary of a research paper published by Gatestone last year, and has attracted over 80, 000 views in other two days. However in light of a ferocious backlash in the Swedish media, the site reactivated Ingrid’s account but failed to explain why it had taken the decision in the first place. The controversy comes after Facebook announced that it would work alongside the European Union and other social media giants, would seek to ‘ban illegal hate speech across Europe.’ The incident will also do little to restore Facebook’s damaged reputation for censorship, having been found to have been suppressing conservative voices and amplifying   movements such as Black Lives Matter. It also comes after Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told German Chancellor Angela Merkel, (the woman responsible for the mass wave of migration into Europe,) that it would crack down on   sentiments being expressed on the platform.

"Democrats Are Asking Hillary Clinton to Step out of the Spotlight - Breitbart. Democrats are reportedly fed up with Hillary Clinton’s litany of excuses for losing the 2016 election and are asking her to step out of the limelight. [The consensus among former Clinton aides, former Obama aides, and Democratic strategists is that Clinton’s remarks blaming the Democratic National Committee and others for her election loss are hurting her image and the image of the Democratic Party, the Hill reported.  “She’s apparently still really, really angry. I mean, we all are. The election was stolen from her, and that’s how she feels,” one longtime Clinton aide said. “But to go out there publicly again and again and talk about it? And then blame the DNC? It’s not helpful to Democrats. It’s not helpful to the country, and I don’t think it’s helpful to her,” the aide added. Former DNC Data Director Andrew Therriault was a lot less restrained in his criticism of Clinton, calling her accusations against the DNC “fucking bullshit. ” Clinton has also gone    blaming former FBI Director James Comey, the Russians, the press, her primary and general election opponents, and even sexism for her election loss. Some aides and strategists think Clinton needs to step out of the spotlight entirely and let new leaders in the party take up that role. “If she is trying to come across as the leader of the angry movement of what happened in 2016, then she’s achieving it,” said one former senior aide to Obama. “But part of the problem she had was she didn’t have a vision for the Democratic Party, and she needs to now take a break and let others come to the forefront. ” Despite those in the party calling on Clinton to leave the public eye, her aides and advisers say she will probably remain in the public spotlight to discuss the 2016 election to promote her book that will be released this fall. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons says that she should talk more about where she went wrong in the election as opposed to blaming others for her elections. “It would be nice to hear a little more about the things she did wrong, which I believe mattered more than what she has discussed,” Simmons said.",1.0
"Martha Stewart, Queen of All Internet.            For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Last year, as part of a holiday special for her   daytime talk show, Martha Stewart —  bedecked, cheekily, in an ugly Christmas sweater —  hosted Snoop Dogg in the show’s studio kitchen. The segment was pretty amazing. The two baked holiday treats together —  brownies, obviously (topped, to drive the    point home, with visually metaphorical green sprinkles). Martha teased Snoop about his stirring technique. She asked him to rap while they mixed ingredients. He complied. She joined in. She described the velvet suit he had worn to the taping (he had politely declined to wear the ugly sweater Martha’s staff had selected for him) as “très elegante. ” The audience —  in the studio, and online —  loved it. Martha and Snoop! Laughing! Rapping! Making weed jokes! It was too much. Martha Stewart and the Cannibal Polar Bears: A True Story, But if there’s one thing mass media can teach the world, it is that the appropriate response to “too much” is “here’s more. ” Martha and Snoop, accordingly, would also hang out together (or à deux, as Martha might say) at Comedy Central’s roast of Justin Bieber. They would appear together on $100, 000 Pyramid. And now, it was announced this week, the Odd Couple of the Age of Irony is reuniting for a regular stint: VH1 will soon be airing a cooking show —  working title: Martha  Snoop’s Dinner Party —  hosted by the duo. Both members of the unlikely celebrity partnership (Snartha? Moop? Stewp Dogg?) have, to be sure, differing commercial goals to be achieved in the  . Snoop has his burgeoning weed business Martha, her vaguely   company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. For Martha, though (we can call her Martha, at this point: We’ve been through a lot with her) the move makes a particular kind of sense. The “domestic diva,” in the wake of both her stint in jail in 2004 (for lying to federal investigators about her stock holdings) and her company’s financial troubles, has been building her brand, in part, by compromising it. She has been expanding that brand according to the logic of the digital world. She has been, basically —  as a celebrity and a personality and a sensibility —  conquering the internet. A VH1 show is not, in strictest terms, the web. But in a broader sense, the media convergence sense, a show like Martha  Snoop’s Dinner Party —  the “domestic diva” hanging with her good friend Snoop, the two of them chatting with celebrity guests and making sly allusions to weed —  is entirely of the internet. And by it, and for it. The web, as a platform, has given rise to a particular cultural style: one that rewards unexpected meetings (Michelle Obama and Missy Elliott!)   experiments (Emoji Dick!) and the overall embrace of irony. Martha seems to intuit this, or at least to give the illusion of intuition. Here are some of the   things Martha has done, in her public life, over the past several years: She discussed sexting on   TV. She alluded to having a threesome. She made, during Bieber’s Comedy Central roast, a very dirty joke about Ludacris and the absorptive capabilities of Martha Stewart Collection bedsheets. She published, on TheMarthaBlog. com, a photo essay about her cats, Princess Peony, Empress Tang, and Blackie. She captioned one of the essay’s pictures, the one featuring Empress Tang curled up in a molcajete, “I call this ‘  . ’” She published several pictures of her Chow Chow, Ghenghis Khan, sitting down to tea at the Plaza. She wrote an opinion piece for Time titled “Why I Love My Drone. ” She made a habit of tweeting pictures of food that, in this age of   perfection, are notable for their   sloppiness. She publicly beefed with Gwyneth Paltrow. She publicly beefed with Taylor Schilling. She publicly beefed with Blake Lively. She publicized her Match. com profile, and then met two of her potential suitors for the first time, live, on the Today show. Martha once tweeted out a single letter —  “K” —  to her many followers on Twitter. Everyone (Was it a  ? A subtweet? An errant DM? The coded key to some     Dan Brown novel?) lost their minds. You could say, as The Daily Dot did a couple of years ago, that “Martha Stewart is trolling the internet into oblivion. ” Except Martha’s trolling is a very friendly kind of trolling, a very inviting kind of trolling. She is, as any good hostess will, simply providing good conversation fodder for the internet’s great dinner party. And she is repaid for that effort with free media —  very positive free media. In 2012, The New York Times declared that Martha “has emerged as something of a patron saint for entrepreneurial hipster. ” AOL reported on the “15 times lifestyle queen Martha Stewart totally owned the internet. ” Last week, Mental Floss shared “Good Things: 20 Perfect Quotes About Life From Martha Stewart. ” With all this, Martha seems to be —  in a way that was never fully the point in the prim, perfectly lit world of Martha Stewart —  having fun. She is provoking, casually. She is trolling, winkily. She is chipping away, with systematic nonchalance, at everything it used to stand for: steely aspiration thirsty perfectionism homemaking as an art and a craft and a Darwinian struggle gilt guilt. Martha, in her homemaking heyday, anticipated the “fantasy of mastery” that would find its apotheosis with the advent of Pinterest and Houzz and Instagram she is now though, it seems, banking on another ethic, and another kind of fantasy —  one that finds empowerment through human folly, one that embraces silliness and messiness and the fact that a Persian cat looks really, really funny while curled up in a guacamole bowl. One that recognizes the communal —  and commercial —  power of memes and snaps and viral whimsy. In a 1996 essay for The New Republic, Margaret Talbot described Martha’s classic approach according to Christopher Lasch’s term: “the invasion of play by the rhetoric of achievement. ” Martha, Talbot explained, “imagines projects of which we would never have thought —  gathering dewy grass for our Easter ham, say —  and makes us feel the pressing need for training in them. And she exploits, brilliantly, a certain estrangement from home that many working women feel these days. ” Two decades later, though, Martha is exploiting the opposite approach: She is allowing the rhetoric of play to seep into the rhetoric of achievement. She is loosening up. She is being   …      . Two decades later, the home estrangement Talbot described has worsened what Martha figured out, though, is that many people are facing that simply by expanding their notions of what “home” might be. One’s living space, one’s workspace, one’s computer, one’s phone —  all of them can be homey. And Martha can, always the homemaker, conquer them all. There she is, with us at work and in the world and on our screens, on YouTube and Instagram and Twitter and US Weekly and, soon enough, VH1. There she’ll be, selling that most sellable of things: a particular vision of a life  .   In March of 2014, Martha did an Ask Me Anything with Reddit. “What’s it like being friends with Snoop Dogg?” one redditor, tall_and_thin, asked her. Martha responded, in typically frank fashion: “I wish I were closer friends with Snoop Dogg. ” Now, through a broadcast dinner party that has all the trappings of reality TV, she’ll get her wish. And that will likely be, for Martha and for Snoop and for a culture that revels in the strategic serendipity that paired them up in the first place, a good thing.",-0.5
"Harry Reid says Sanders has no path to the nomination.  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday he does not think Bernie Sanders has a path to winning the Democratic presidential nomination. Responding to questions at his weekly news conference Reid declined to suggest Sanders should drop out or cede the ground to Hillary Clinton, who’s expected to post a strong showing in primaries Tuesday in Maryland, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The Nevada Democrat said Sanders is a good person who ”has run a campaign that I think we’ve all recognized has been unique and powerful, and I think Bernie should do what he wants to do.” But asked whether Sanders has a path to the nomination Reid did not equivocate. ”No, I do not,” he said. ”Bernie is going to do what he feels is appropriate and I have every confidence that Bernie, his No. 1 issue is not him, it’s the country,” Reid added.

"Breitbart’s Klein: Iran ‘On the March’ Obama ‘Nowhere’ To Be Found - Breitbart. Iran is “on the march” while President Obama’s foreign policy is “nowhere” to be found, opined Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein in a radio interview. [Klein was speaking during his weekly segment on John Batchelor’s popular national radio show.  Click below to listen to the full interview.  “Iran is on the march and there are many moving parts here,” explained Klein.  “The tectonic plates have shifted here in the Middle East  …    and the question is where is the United States?” Klein continued, speaking to Batchelor: “So because the United States is nowhere, because the president of the United State did almost nothing when Iran   a ballistic missile in October, total violation of a Security Council resolution. Multiple   exercises in the Strait of Hormuz a few weeks ago. The U. S. did nothing. So the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, backed up by Ayatollah Khomeini, of course, they understand that they can stage this provocation. ” In a Breitbart Jerusalem analysis piece on Wednesday, Klein viewed Iran’s capture and subsequent release of ten American sailors as a “deliberately generated crisis” by the country’s Islamic hardliners “for pure domestic consumption with the aim of ensuring the ayatollahs’s continued grip on power. ” “Of course, the latest events must also be seen through the lens of the wider   divide,” added Klein, “and the need for the Iranians to regain the narrative and upstage the Saudi axis after the Kingdom’s provocative killing earlier this month of the prominent Shiite cleric Nimr Baqir  . ” “It is stunning that the Iranians believe they can get away with these provocations while they use the Obama administration as willing dupes for their internal   propaganda efforts. ”",1.0
"Melania and Barron Trump will move to the White House this summer. Melania Trump will move into the White House this summer after having remained in Trump Tower in New York since her husband took over the presidency in January. The couple’s    son, Barron, will attend St Andrew’s Episcopal school, a private preparatory school in Potomac, Maryland, after finishing fifth grade at Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in Manhattan, a White House spokeswoman said, and the two will join Donald Trump in Washington. In a statement, Melania Trump said she chose St Andrew’s Episcopal school because “it is known for its diverse community and commitment to academic excellence”. “The mission of St Andrew’s is ‘to know and inspire each child in an inclusive community dedicated to exceptional teaching, learning, and service’ all of which appealed to our family. We look forward to the coming school years at St Andrew’s,” she said in a statement. The school declined to confirm the announcement, citing privacy concerns.  The school, founded in 1978, describes itself as an “independent, coeducational college preparatory school” that educates 580 students from preschool through 12th grade and boasts a college enrollment rate of 100%. Annual tuition for students in grades six through eight is $38, 590, according to the school’s website. Rumors had swirled for months about whether Melania and Barron would remain in New York permanently after it was confirmed that they would continue to live in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue for at least the remainder of the school year. The move should relieve law enforcement agencies saddled with the task of protecting a first family divided between major US cities and satisfy New York City officials and Democrats who have raised concerns about the significant cost of protecting the family. The New York police department has estimated that it costs the city between $127, 000 to $146, 000 a day to protect Melania and Barron while they reside in Trump Tower, according to a memo by the department’s commissioner. The NYPD did not return a request for comment on how their relocation would affect the daily costs.  There has been some media criticism claiming Melania Trump has been unable to fully play the role of first lady from New York.  Trump’s daughter Tiffany announced recently that she would be joining the family in Washington soon. Trump’s youngest daughter and his only child with his second wife, Marla Maples, will attend law school at Georgetown in the fall.  It is believed Barron will be the first presidential child to attend the school, which is located roughly 20 miles from the White House in suburban Maryland. The Obamas, like the Clintons, the Nixons and the Roosevelts before them, sent their children to Sidwell Friends school, the private   academy that has long educated Washington’s elite.  Despite St Andrew’s religious affiliation, its website states that the school does not want to “‘make Episcopalians’ out of our students”. Instead, the website says the school teaches “respect for other religious traditions and even for those periods of life when a person is not identified with a particular tradition”.  Not since John F Kennedy’s presidency has a first son called the White House home. The White House has not confirmed a moving day yet but the school year begins on 5 September. ",-0.5
"'Love Actually' director uses Pokémon Go to put focus on global poverty | TheHill. Screenwriter Richard Curtis is trying to direct world leader’s attention to global poverty by creating Pokéstops in Davos on the popular Pokémon Go mobile app.  The writer of movies such as “Love Actually” is creating 17 Pokéstops — virtual stops that users can physically go to and interact with in the game — that correspond with United Nations-backed Project Everyone’s “Global Goals,” reports Business Insider. Curtis helped found Project Everyone. The stops, which are accessible in Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum is being held, share titles with the goals, like “Zero Hunger” and “Good Health.” The World Economic Forum hosts annually the world’s most prominent leaders and thinkers, who convene in Davos to address issues plaguing the global community. In their goals, Project Everyone aims to create a “fairer world by 2030, where extreme poverty has been eradicated, climate change is properly addressed and injustice and inequality are unacceptable,” according to Project Everyone’s website. Pokémon Go briefly became a cultural phenomenon when it was released last summer. Since then it has been downloaded over 500 million times. Niantic Labs, the game development company that created Pokémon Go for Nintendo, told Business Insider that the game had been optimized to be played at the forum in Davos.  “Whether they go to the Davos Congress, which has been turned into a 'Pokémon Gym,' or whether they go to the train station, each of these big locations and social gatherings corresponds to one of the stops,"" said Matthieu de Fayet, the vice president of Niantic. Niantic plans to roll out the “Global Goals” later in the year to all Pokémon Go users.  ""The sustainable development goals are something that the next generation will fight for, and something we're trying to make as popular as we can with young people — as well as making them important and meaningful to business and politicians,"" Curtis said. ""Based on the number of Pokémon Go downloads, 10% of the planet are familiar with the game, and will be engaged around not only the game but also with these important goals,"" De Fayet added.

"** SPONSORED CONTENT** Restoring Faith in Health Care. The 2016 presidential campaign was characterized by discussions of the last administration’s healthcare policy failures and, depending on who you listened to, promises to either change the existing law or do away with it entirely. Things have gotten so bad, even many sympathetic to the previous administration have admitted the government’s   solution for American healthcare wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. [Until last month, what no one knew for certain was whether all that talk would result in action, or if the new administration would maintain the status quo. Oddly enough, both ended up happening. House Republicans’ early attempt at healthcare reform was commendable, but the lack of support it received means that, for now at least, nothing is going to change. It turns out this isn’t going to be nearly as straightforward as lawmakers projected. And unfortunately for many Americans struggling under penalties or devastatingly high premiums, there’s no end in sight.  So other than wait for Washington to come up with a plan that will pass muster with legislators, the president, and most importantly the American people, what can we do? For starters, we can remember that we the people still have the freedom to determine our own destiny and to act out of our sincerely held beliefs in every area, including where our healthcare is concerned. That might be a new concept to some: how exactly can you let your faith guide your healthcare decisions? Long before insurance was regarded as the primary way to manage healthcare costs, as far back as in the early days of the Church, faith communities joined together to share in one another’s burdens. As a Christian healthcare sharing ministry, Liberty HealthShare is based on the belief that this tradition has always been, and continues to be, the most morally and financially sound way to approach medical costs. Liberty members have dared to leave the insurance model behind and instead act on their sincerely held beliefs where their healthcare is concerned. If you have always functioned within the insurance model, medical cost sharing probably feels foreign to you. But if the government healthcare overhaul has placed you in a position of having to take something you never wanted, consider that you can put yourself back in the driver’s seat where your health is concerned. You can begin by educating yourself about healthcare sharing and Liberty HealthShare. Healthcare sharing   and precedes anything the government has or can come up with. Liberty HealthShare was here before the ACA was rolled out their members are exempt from the mandates and fines associated with it, and they are able to operate without fear of government interference. For those who read and agree to their Statement of Shared Beliefs, and who will honestly and ethically engage with the member community, true healthcare freedom is possible. Liberty HealthShare values what you value: freedom, personal responsibility, and community. Whereas government solutions can almost be guaranteed to TAKE freedom from you, membership in a healthcare sharing ministry GIVES you freedom to make your own decisions, to steward your own health, and to help and be helped when you or your neighbors face unforeseen medical costs. Finally, Liberty HealthShare rejects     solutions. They know each family has preferences concerning how they want to manage their own health, and they respect that. Rather than a government interpretation of what’s best for all Americans, Liberty HealthShare encourages members to maintain a close relationship with their doctors so they can have open conversations and, when necessary, develop care plans that are best for their members’ health and finances. What makes this possible on a large scale is that Liberty members steward their health and finances in community, considering the effects of their decisions not only on themselves but on other members. If there’s one thing that characterizes Americans, it’s the   innovative spirit that says we are capable of coming up with good answers to the problems we face each day. Our healthcare is no exception to this rule. Liberty HealthShare is happy to offer its members a way to join with others to live out the belief that our rights come from God, and we are responsible to him and one another for the way we treat our bodies. While Washington tries to hammer out their next big fix for our healthcare needs, we don’t need to wait. We can exercise our freedom right now. Visit Libertyhealthshare.  for more information.",1.0
"Samsung Elec warns of difficult 2016 as smartphone troubles spread.  Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( ) warned on Thursday of possible weaker earnings this year due to softer sales of gadgets such as smartphones, a trend that is also hurting rival Apple Inc ( ) and major chipmakers. The South Korean firm’s warning came a day after Apple shares fell more than 6. 5 percent, the biggest percentage drop in two years, as the iPhone maker forecast its first quarterly sales drop in 13 years. Slowing economic growth in China and weaker emerging market currencies are undercutting sales of electronics ranging from televisions to personal computers, spelling trouble not only for Samsung and Apple but also for their suppliers and the broader industry. ”Broadly weaker IT demand will make it difficult to maintain 2016 profits at the level of the previous year’s,” Samsung said in a statement accompanying its   results, adding that ”challenging business conditions” would remain for the current quarter and last throughout the first half of this year. The world’s No. 1 maker of smartphones and memory chips said its   operating profit was 6. 1 trillion won ($5. 05 billion) matching its earlier guidance. Revenue rose 1. 1 percent to 53. 3 trillion won, slightly better than the 53 trillion won it had guided for.  The maker of Galaxy smartphones and tablets reported a   2015 operating profit of 26. 4 trillion won, compared with 25 trillion won the previous year.  Samsung shares ended down 2. 6 percent on Thursday, underperforming a 0. 5 percent rise for the broader market  . Some investors and analysts believe Samsung will see its profit fall for the second time in three years in 2016, as slack demand for gadgets undercuts prices of memory chips and displays that helped to offset declining mobile profits last year. The semiconductor division was the top earner for the sixth straight quarter in the   period, lifting its operating profit to 2. 80 trillion won from 2. 70 trillion won a year earlier. Mobile division profit slipped 7. 3 percent from the third quarter to 2. 23 trillion won, its weakest result in four quarters. Samsung said   mobile profits would improve slightly, boosted by the launch of new smartphones, although overall smartphone shipments were expected to decline slightly.   Samsung also said it will buy back and cancel 2. 99 trillion won worth of common and preferred shares, marking the second round of share purchases as part of a 11. 3 trillion buyback plan announced late last year. It also declared a   dividend of 20, 000 won per share.   Later on Thursday, the firm said it will sell a 37. 5 percent stake in Samsung Card Co Ltd ( ) to Samsung Life Insurance Co Ltd ( ) for 1. 54 trillion won ($1. 3 billion) the proceeds from which will be used to fund new businesses.  The transaction will give Samsung Life a 71. 9 percent stake in Samsung Card, a step that analysts say furthers Samsung Group’s restructuring efforts to streamline its ownership structure and solidify the founding Lee family’s control over the    conglomerate.      (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates and Muralikumar Anantharaman) OSLO Alphabet Inc’s  Google unit expects to receive its first wind power from Norway by early September, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.

"Is The Walking Dead’s Villain Killing the Show?. For years, any argument over The Walking Dead’s quality has been rendered almost moot by its enormous viewership. AMC had no real impetus to demand tweaks from a show that delivered such   ratings (and yielded hit   Talking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead). But in its return on Sunday night, there was a palpable sense of panic to the episode —  a promise to get things back on the right track after a year of sadistic misery. The problem is that new storytelling approach may well end up feeling just as dull and predictable. The Walking Dead Might Be Its Own Villain, After all, the sixth season of The Walking Dead unfolded with something concrete to look forward to: the appearance of Negan, a tyrant who rules over many of Virginia’s   communities with his group The Saviors. The casting of Morgan was announced long before his first appearance, the   hype series Talking Dead stoked fan excitement for his arrival, and readers of the Walking Dead comic books knew how crucial he’d be to future plotlines. But while in   form Negan is a classic supervillain —  much discussed, rarely seen, and brutally memorable every time he shows up —  on TV, he was an almighty dud. It’s not so much that he didn’t wreak havoc (he did). But suddenly The Walking Dead became The Negan Show, a seemingly endless exploration of a man who uses terror to achieve all his goals. The entire first half of the seventh season was about the extent to which he dominated Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and his band of zombie fighters, through murder, torment, and ongoing threats of death and destruction. It was gruesome and hard to watch, but more importantly, it was incredibly boring —  an exercise in repetitive punishment designed to remind the viewer just how difficult it would be for Rick and company to resist. Sunday’s midseason premiere, “Rock in the Road,” marked the beginning of said resistance. Sick of Negan’s ongoing campaign of death, Rick is finally assuming a leadership role again and starting to communicate with the surrounding communities that exist under Negan’s thumb to plot an organized insurgency. There are eight episodes in every   of The Walking Dead (starting in season three) and one imagines this rebellion will take about seven episodes to get going, building to a grand showdown for the spring finale. “Rock in the Road” mostly concerned itself with Rick asking King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) the bombastic leader of a town called The Kingdom, and Gregory (Xander Berkeley) the twitchy head of the farming Hilltop Colony, for help. The   to Negan’s downfall will likely be easier to watch than the   to his arrival there’s at least some nuance to the web of alliances he has to knit, and the different types of leaders he has to negotiate with. But it still has a dull air of inevitability, and the expected payoff may not be enough to turn ratings around. It’s very rare for a hit show to rebound after its viewership begins to slide —  at a certain point, you’ve been on too long to attract enough new viewers to replace anyone who’s jumping ship, and there aren’t as many daring story tricks to pull. The promise of Negan was, in many ways, more exciting than the reveal —  once he arrived and proved himself to be good at one thing (hitting people with a    baseball bat) his appeal quickly deflated. The Walking Dead’s ratings are still sensational by the general yardstick of basic cable, so the show’s cancelation isn’t on the horizon yet. Attempts to find a proper successor for it have been mixed —  the   adaptation Preacher drew solid reviews but lackluster ratings, and the spinoffs Fear the Walking Dead and Better Call Saul (an attempt to draw out the Breaking Bad legacy) are not as popular as their forbears. AMC will continue to squeeze whatever they can out of their last genuine smash hit —  and the comic book it’s based on continues to run, so it’s not like it lacks for material. What The Walking Dead does lack for is excitement —  not just from critics, but also from fans —  and this   will be its chance to gain it back. The show can still execute a bizarre     better than any, but its primary villains are always going to be regular people. As long as Negan is in place, The Walking Dead will feel like it’s keeping time, just to make his downfall seem all the more significant. In the show’s best season (the fifth) a new villain was introduced every three or four episodes and dispatched just as quickly, giving the show an appropriately apocalyptic sense of urgency. Under Negan’s yoke, that’s vanished by the time it returns, it might be too late.",-0.5
"Scientists closer to growing human organs in animals. Biologists have announced that, for the first time, they had succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. It's a huge advance, one that opens the possibility of developing human organs in animals that can later be withdrawn and implanted in humans. Why this matters: If pigs from such embryos could survive with human organs growing inside them it would open up the possibility of harvesting human organs for transplant that could end the backlog of waiting lists for such organs. The developments were announced in two separate science journals, by two different sets of research teams experimenting with different aspects of the race to grow human organs in animals such as pigs. It's the first proof of a concept that genomes from species that separated 90 million years ago can be combined. The genetic term is ""chimera."" One team of scientists from the Salk Institute proved that human stem cells can be combined in such a way that they actually help form the tissues of a pig. A second team from the University of Tokyo and Stanford, showed how diabetes could be reversed in mice by introducing pancreas glands into them that had been grown in rats. Both studies were published in Cell and Nature. The two studies, together, clearly show that it is feasible and possible to grow human organs in host animals like pigs, though it will be some time before the research leads to a process for human organs to be grown and harvested for human transplant. When it is finally developed, it will look something like this for a patient waiting for a transplant: you would take stem cells from the patient's skin, implant it in a pig as it grows and then harvest it once the organ has developed. Because the organ has developed from the patient's own cells, there is less risk of an immune response and rejection. Our thought bubble: While tens of thousands of people in the United States alone are desperately in need of human organs for transplant, the process is still likely to be controversial when the concept moves from the lab to production. The ability to essentially ""humanize"" a pig or other large animals is why, in 2015, the National Institutes of Health banned the use of public funds for research that would insert human cells into animal embryos. They tried to lift the ban last August, but got so many responses that it slowed the process down again. It's hard to imagine that the Trump administration will lift the ban on chimera research now, given the potential controversy.",0.0

"Designed for iPhone 8, Weather Atlas is a great replacement for your stock weather app – TechCrunch. There’s no shortage of weather apps on the market, but you may have noticed that few of them are actually all that good. That’s where a new entry called Weather Atlas, from the developer behind the popular productivity app Launch Center Pro, comes in. This newly launched weather application aims to be a better alternative to the stock weather app, offering a more modern take on weather apps, as well as a design that’s ready for the new, taller screen expected in the upcoming iPhone 8. According to Weather Atlas creator, David Barnard, the app includes bottom-focused navigation modeled after Apple’s Maps app, as well as a stacked maps and forecast that will take advantage of the extra space provided by the iPhone 8’s extra vertical space. “Weather Atlas started as an update to my old weather app, Perfect Weather,” he explains. “I built Perfect Weather in 2013 because there were no apps at the time that showed a glanceable view of both the forecasts and weather maps,” Barnard continues. “Living in Texas where storms can pop up randomly or blow through from the north or south, I like to take a quick look at the radar even if there’s no rain forecasted in my immediate area.” “In 2017 there are now a few weather apps that do show both the forecast and weather maps in the same view, but none of them do it well,” he adds. Plus, he notes that even though the weather app market is crowded, these apps see high usage, which makes the idea to enter the space still compelling. I have to agree that many of today’s top weather apps are starting a feel a bit dated. Yahoo’s entry in the space years ago was then heralded as a surprisingly attractive creation with its heavy focus on visuals, but its big in-app advertisements have since limited its appeal. Meanwhile, other highly ranked apps like those from The Weather Channel, Weather Underground, AccuWeather, WeatherBug and others perform their utilitarian tasks as promised, but their designs feel a little less-than-current. Then there’s that small matter of how AccuWeather was sending users’ location data to a third party, which recently led many users to dump the app from their iPhone. (If that’s a concern for you, Weather Atlas is a good replacement because it doesn’t require your location to work. There are ways to use it without providing access to your personal data. And if you do share location data, it’s not sold or shared with ad networks.) [gallery ids=""1535211,1535212,1535210,1535209,1535208""] At launch, the new app includes a 10-day forecast; but unlike some weather apps, this forecast also includes hourly breakdowns for all ten days – just keeping scrolling on the hourly forecast screen to see the later days. The mapping component in the app will display radar and cloud layers, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation accumulation – layers that aren’t that aren’t as standard elsewhere. The app also supports warning layers for things like thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tropical tracks – the latter being especially timely given how Hurricane Irma is now getting cooked up out in the Atlantic. Plus, Weather Atlas takes advantage of another newer iOS feature, as well – it lets you choose your preferred app icon for your homescreen from a broad selection. Though support for customizable icons were launched earlier this year with iOS 10.3, it’s  still not too common these days to see apps offering this feature. Outside of MLB at Bat and NHL’s apps, we haven’t seen broad adoption from the developer community. You can even change the weather icons within the app to match your preferred style. A Notification Center widget is included, too, if that’s where you prefer to check the forecast. [gallery ids=""1535220,1535219""] On iPad, the app leverages Apple’s latest technologies like Split View. The app, at launch, provides most of the basics you’d need, but will be updated with support for other features in future releases like push notifications. However, the plan is not to overwhelm users’ with too much data like “some of the nerdier weather apps” do, as Barnard puts it. The app is a free download and is ad-supported, but you can remove ads by paying a $4.99 annual subscription, or $0.49 per month. This “Pro” subscription allows you to support the app’s maker, and gain access to other features including some of those mentioned above, like the customizable icons; warning layers on the maps; additional weather layers like Temperature, Humidity, and Precipitation Accumulation; and Hourly and Daily widgets. (The Current Conditions widget is free though.) Subscriptions for weather apps is now a fairly common practice – The Weather Channel, for example, lets you block ads by subscription. Not everyone wants to pay, of course, which is why Weather Atlas still works well without the upgrade. (But I have to say the ads are pretty distracting…it’s worth paying to remove them.) However, since its launch yesterday, around 7 percent of those who downloaded the app subscribed. That’s closer to 10 percent, if you only count those who launched the app and checked it out, notes Barnard. Weather Atlas is available for the U.S. only in the App Store. Other countries may be supported in the future.",0.0
"New York village votes to keep logo criticized as racist.  Folks in a central New York village want to keep the community’s official logo, which appears to show a white man choking a Native American, even though critics call it racist. In a   vote Monday night, residents of Whitesboro    a village of about 3, 700 in Oneida County    voted   to not change their current seal.    The Whitesboro website says the emblem dates to the early 1900s and depicts a friendly wrestling match between village founder Hugh White and an Oneida Indian. It says White won the match and the lasting goodwill of the Oneidas.  ”In 1963, the Seal was   by local artist, Gerald E. Pugh, to commemorate the Village’s Sesquicentennial,” the town says on its website. ”In an article of the Observer Dispatch, written by Joe Kelly in 1977, a notice of claim was filed with the Village Board saying the seal depicts a ’white man choking an Indian’ and said the seal demeans, disgraces and creates prejudice and distrust of Indian people,” a statement on the ”history” section of the town’s website says. Kelly asked the village to stop displaying the seal, and, as a result of this, the seal was   with Hugh White’s hands being placed on the Indian’s shoulders and ”not so close to his neck,” according to the statement. ”The wrestling match was an important event in the history of the settling of the Village of Whitesboro and helped foster good relations between White and the Indians,” the town says. The seal appears on village police cars, signs and stationery. Controversy has waxed and waned over the years and came to a head last summer, when an online petition was posted by someone who saw the logo and took offense. Ben Miller, of Manhasset, N. Y. started a petition on Change. org last summer to redesign the sign. ”Recently, I noticed a disturbing image emblazoned on the city seal of a town in my home state,” Miller writes on the petition, which now has nearly 10, 000 signatures. ”The city of Whitesboro, NY proudly displays what looks like a European settler choking, or violently handling, a Native American man. According to legend, the seal represents a famous wrestling match between the city’s founder, Hugh White, and a Native American man,” Miller writes. ”White won the match, thereby gaining the local Indians’ respect. But to me, this seal is anything but respectful to my people and my heritage,” said Miller, who also wrote that he is a Lenape Indian and a citizen of both the Delaware Tribe of Indians and Cherokee Nation. Miller’s sentiments have been echoed by residents from around the state. ”I’m signing because I am a Mohawk Native American from New York State and I am deeply offended by the seal depicting the slaughter of my people,” wrote one supporter.  Miller’s petition, however, was launched after the mass shooting by a white gunman inside a historically black church in Charleston, S. C. in June. Images and news stories about the sign flooded Twitter, with hashtags like #TakeItDown, #ChangeTheSeal, #NotTheOnion and #RedesigntheSign. The town mayor was not immediately available for comment when contacted Tuesday. The logo has been the subject of debate for more than 55 years. According to a 2009 article in the Utica   Whitesboro was sued over the seal by a Native American group in the 1970s. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",1.0

"The media's Russia probe meltdown: 3 screw-ups in one week. The media is having a rough week when it comes to reporting on the federal government's multiple ongoing Russia investigations. Three stories in the past seven days have crumbled under greater scrutiny. Why it matters: In today's hyperpolarized world, ""fake news"" has become a refrain to describe stories that observers on both sides of the spectrum decide that they don't like. These reporting issues by esteemed media organizations give credence to that ignorance, which further damages the value of insightful, impactful reporting — especially when it comes to one of the biggest, most polarizing stories of our political age: the Russia probe. Flynn's testimony: Last Friday, ABC News reported that former national security advisor Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that President Trump, while still a candidate, directed him to contact Russian officials. But later in the day, the network issued a ""clarification"" that the direction came when Trump was president-elect. That changed the impact of the story entirely as it's a common occurrence for presidential transition teams to reach out to foreign governments. Deutsche Bank subpoena: Reuters and Bloomberg both reported on Tuesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation had subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for information on accounts relating to President Trump and his family members — seemingly confirming that Mueller had expanded his probe to investigate the president's financial dealings. The WSJ defused that bombshell in a follow-up report stating that the subpoenas actually dealt with ""people or entities close to Mr. Trump."" WikiLeaks emails: CNN reported this morning that senior Trump campaign officials, including Trump himself, received an email from an unknown sender on September 4, 2016 that linked them to what could have been unreleased WikiLeaks documents. WaPo issued their own report later in the afternoon that the email was actually sent on September 14 — and linked to a trove of documents that WikiLeaks had publicly released a day earlier.

"Donald Trump Mocks ’Resist’ Democrats at Obamacare Meeting with Senate Republicans. President Donald Trump met with Republican senators for lunch at the White House to discuss progress on the bill to replace Obamacare, using the occasion to highlight the failures of former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare plan and the obstruction of Democrats. [“Obamacare has been broken, and it’s been a broken promise,” Trump said to the press, pointing to the “lies” by Democrats that Americans could keep their doctor and their plan and would experience lower premiums.

Trump did not go into detail about what the Senate Republican bill would include, but he said it would be “phenomenal” and “generous, kind, with heart. ” The Democrats, Trump said, were “obstructionists,” whom he said would never support Republican efforts to fix health care. “Even their new motto  —   ‘Resist’  —   I guess it’s a pretty accurate motto. Every time I see it, I say, ‘That’s right. That does represent the Democrats,’” he said.

"Super Typhoon Meranti targets Taiwan, mainland China. Hong Kong (CNN) Hundreds of people have been evacuated in southern Taiwan and China has issued a red alert as the region braces for the impact of the strongest storm of the year.  Super Typhoon Meranti is barreling down on Taiwan, bringing wind speeds of up to 230 miles per hour (370 kph) faster than a Formula One race car, and torrential rains.  Schools and offices across the south of the island have closed and dozens of flights have been canceled, according to the official China News Agency.  Two people have been injured, and more than 260, 000 households have lost power in counties across southern Taiwan, according to Taiwan authorities.  More than 370 domestic and international flights have been canceled and train services have also been suspended.  As of 7 a. m. local time Wednesday morning, around 1, 500 people had been evacuated from the affected areas, Li   of the Taiwan Central Emergency Operating Center, told CNN.  Almost 4, 000 military and police personnel have been deployed to the region to prepare for potential future evacuations, but he said authorities are not expecting major damage or destruction.  China braces for impact, While the 23 million people in Taiwan are likely to be buffeted and soaked by Meranti, the main brunt of the storm will fall on mainland China. The storm is expected to make landfall in Guangdong or Fujian provinces during the day on Thursday.  Authorities in six   provinces as well as Shanghai have initiated emergency response measures as the storm approaches, according to state run news agency Xinhua.  If the storm makes landfall in eastern Guangdong, it could be the strongest to hit the province in 47 years, Xinhua reported.  ”It only took nine hours for Meranti to grow into a super typhoon from a typhoon,” Guangdong meteorologist Zhang Dong told the news agency.  ”Packing winds between 202 to 220 kilometers per hour, it is interacting with another storm, Malakas, 1, 000 kilometers away, and the route could be hard to predict.” China’s National Meteorological Center issued a red typhoon warning at 6 a. m. local time Wednesday, while authorities warned that waves eight to 13 meters (26 to 42 feet) high could be expected in the northeastern part of the South China Sea.  Super typhoon, After a period of rapid intensification Monday and Tuesday, which saw Meranti grow from a Category 1 equivalent storm to that of a   Category 5 in only 24 hours, the super typhoon has maintained winds of 190 mph (305 kph) for nearly 24 hours. With current gusts of up to 230 mph (370 kph) Meranti is the strongest typhoon since Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in 2013 and is the strongest storm to come this close to Taiwan since 1959. The storm is nearing the southern tip of Taiwan, and though its eye may pass a few miles south of the island, dangerous   winds greater than 74 mph (120 kph) extend nearly 80 miles (125 km) and will cover much of Southern Taiwan. From there the storm will track through toward the northwest and move into mainland China. Storm veterans  Taiwan, despite being a frequent target for powerful Pacific typhoons, has a very good track record of limiting the storms’ deadly impacts. But as storms move into the mainland, they often turn deadlier.  The flatter terrain    prone to storm surges and inland flooding    and higher population density often result in higher numbers of people killed or misplaced by the storm. This was the case with a similar storm, Super Typhoon Nepartak, which hit in almost the same location as where Meranti is forecast to travel. Nepartak, which made landfall on July 8, caused at least three deaths in Taiwan and cut power to over half a million, but became much deadlier as it moved into mainland China. Despite weakening to a tropical storm as it hit mainland China, Nepartak and its associated heavy rainfall of up to 10 inches (254 mm) killed more than 80 people. Meranti is expected to be much stronger than Nepartak when it hits mainland China, with winds around 130 mph (210 kph) which would make it equivalent to a major Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico.",-1.0
"Argentina reaches settlement in U.S. debt class action: mediator.  Argentina has reached a deal with lawyers pursuing a U. S. class action lawsuit over defaulted debt to resolve the case, as part of the country’s efforts to settle   litigation over its 2002 default, a   mediator said Tuesday. Daniel Pollack, a New York lawyer overseeing the settlement talks, said the agreement in principle ”fit within the numerics” of Argentina’s proposed offer earlier this month to resolve various lawsuits by holders of defaulted bonds. Exactly how many bondholders are covered by the class action settlement would be known in several weeks, Pollack said. Those who do participate would receive 100 percent of the principal owed and 50 percent of the interest on that principal, he said. Pollack said the deal was conditioned on the approval of the Argentine Congress and the lifting of injunctions issued by U. S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in the litigation. He added that he was ”hopeful that there will be more settlements to come.” Jason Zweig, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he was pleased Argentina had ”decided to put this matter behind them.” ”This shows that the proposal is good and that we are continuing to advance positively. We hope that there will be more agreements in the coming days,” said a source in the Argentine finance ministry. The deal came after Argentina, headed by President Mauricio Macri, on Feb. 5 proposed paying $6. 5 billion to settle litigation stemming from its record $100 billion default in 2002. Two out of six leading bondholders pursuing have already accepted the offer, Pollack has said. The offer represents a 27. 5 percent to 30 percent discount for creditors who filed claims of about $9 billion. But Elliott Management’s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management LP, among the leading creditors pursuing individual lawsuits in the dispute, have not accepted the offer. Those creditors spurned Argentina’s 2005 and 2010 debt restructurings, which resulted in 92 percent of its defaulted debt being swapped and investors being paid less than 30 cents on the dollar. The class action lawsuit in Tuesday’s accord was one of several by boldholders who sought to pursue claims as a group. Plaintiffs led by Henry Brecher, one of the bondholders, until recently sought $68 million. But a U. S. appeals court in September dealt the plaintiffs a setback by throwing out a ruling that had expanded the class action. As a result, the plaintiffs were expected at a hearing in April to present a revised model in which the damages that could be sought would have been limited to only investors who held the bonds for a continuous defined period.

"Maxine Waters is having a moment. Washington (CNN) It lasted all of 30 seconds. Rep. Maxine Waters was at the podium to explain just what she thought of FBI Director James Comey after a briefing on the Russia investigation. Waters: Can I help you? What do you want? Reporter: Can you tell us anything about the discussion? Waters: No, it’s classified. And we can’t tell you anything. All I can tell you is the FBI director has no credibility. It was that barely there January news conference that introduced Maxine Waters to millennials. She is now ”Auntie Maxine,” a   highly quotable and   worthy progressive darling. An article on Elle. com declared: ”Congresswoman Maxine Waters Will Read You Now.” A Salon writer listed five reasons Maxine Waters should be our next president. (She has no plans to run.) Yahoo Style: Maxine Waters Wears Trendiest Denim Jacket of the Season While Protesting Donald Trump. And BET hailed: ”Maxine Waters is Crowned the Queen of Shade.” It’s not hard to see why she got that title    even though she had to ask her grandkids what ”throwing shade” means. (See  : ”Shade is a subtle, sneering expression of contempt for or disgust with someone    sometimes verbal, and sometimes not. ”) Waters’ shade is sometimes verbal, and sometimes not. ”She makes the best faces, the perfect black women faces, faces that say 1, 000 words without (her) saying anything,” said Brittany Packnett, who donned a ”Maxine the Maverick”   as she posed for selfies with Waters at a Friday night event. ”Social media is perfect to display that.” For Waters, elected in 1990, the   attention is puzzling and energizing. She has ramped up her social media presence, headlined rallies and open mic nights.  ”Did you come to be with Auntie Maxine?” she asked a cheering crowd Friday at Busboys and Poets.  Recalling the press briefing, Waters expressed    in much more colorful language    what she was up to, and seemed puzzled by the response.  ”When I came out of that classified briefing, I wanted to let people know that bulls*** had just taken place,” Waters said. ”It went viral. I was just being me.” Waters, the   black woman in Congress, has attracted the kind of Internet buzz not seen since Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose rumpled look and talk of revolution endeared him to mostly white millennials, particularly young men. Waters is a favorite of the black twitterati and a fairly broad swath of progressives, who find her blunt talk of resistance and impeachment refreshing.   ”It’s important for us to have her back and for us to follow her lead and to encourage people with similar platform,” Packnett said. ”Now is the time when we need people to publicly, actively practice courage.” Yet in some ways, Waters’ turn in the spotlight points to the Democratic party’s thin    and cautious    bench and leadership ranks. While most Democrats attended Trump’s inauguration, Waters refused to go, memorably saying she didn’t want to have anything to do with Trump. She has also frequently talked about leading Trump to impeachment, again, with the kind of colorful language that progressives and the internet loves. ”We have to stop his ass,” she said to the packed house at Busboys and Poets. ”Auntie, Auntie, Auntie, Auntie!” the crowd roared back. So what to do with her   platform?   Waters said she has approached Tom Perez, the newly elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee, about putting some resources into engaging millennials. Though Hillary Clinton was a majority younger voters’ choice for president    55% % of voters aged   per exit polls    she underperformed President Barack Obama’s 2012 showing against Mitt Romney, who won the same group 60% %. ”I’m not a leader of millennials. I can be a catalyst, I can be an enabler,” she said in an interview with CNN. ”I want to open up doors with my party . .. I know there is a lack of trust a lack of real relationships between these young people and my party.” ”I want to get them in at least to see what it is they would like to change and how they can do that. We can ensure that they really are involved with what the party does,” she added.",-1.0
"Most iOS devices now run iOS 11 – TechCrunch. Apple has updated its App Store support page with new metrics. As of November 6, 2017, iOS 11 is now installed on 52 percent of iPhones and iPads currently in use. 38 percent of devices still run iOS 10, and only 10 percent of people are using an earlier version of iOS. Apple usually updates this page quite quickly after the release of a major iOS update. This year, the company waited a bit as the iPhone X was released just last week, creating a new influx of iOS 11 users. And it looks like adoption rate is a bit slower this year. Last year, Apple reported roughly the same numbers on October 11 with 54 percent of users running iOS 10. The iPhone X could be part of the reason why it took longer to reach the same number. But my theory is that emojis are the main driving force when it comes to iOS updates. Last year, iOS 10.0 shipped with dozens of new emojis. This year, Apple added new emojis as part of iOS 11.1, which was released last week. Many users don’t want to be left behind on the emoji front. It has become such an important part of pop culture that many users want to be able to see all emojis and not just question marks for missing characters. Still, 52 percent of market share in just a couple of months is quite impressive. Most Android users are still using Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Google released this version more than two years ago. Apple is currently working on iOS 11.2. This release should be available in just a few weeks and come with a major new features for U.S. customers — Apple Pay Cash. This could be enough to push people to update.",0.0
"US oil ends 3.3 pct higher, at $47.85, amid post-Brexit bargain hunting. Oil prices closed higher Tuesday as investors bought back into the market after a two-day rout triggered by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Potential oil supply outages and crude inventory drawdowns also returned investors' attention to market fundamentals. A looming strike at several Norwegian oil and gas fields that threatened output in western Europe's biggest producer helped put a floor beneath crude futures after an 8 percent price slump over two days. Investors were also counting on a sizable and a sixth weekly drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, with oil market analysts polled by Reuters forecasting a 2.4 million-barrel drawdown. Trade group The American Petroleum Institute will issue a preliminary report on crude inventories at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), ahead of official stockpiles data from the U.S. government on Wednesday. A report by industry monitor Genscape that showed a 1.3 million barrel fall in crude inventories at the benchmark's pricing hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, added further support, brokerage PVM said. ""Oil is recovering on some bargain hunting after the drop below $47 a barrel proved unsustainable and (on) news of a possible strike in Norwegian oil and gas industry,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. Brent crude futures traded $1.44, or 3 percent, higher at $48.61 per barrel. The contract earlier peaked at $48.58. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures settled $1.52 higher, or 3.3 percent, at $47.85. It hit a session high of $47.81 earlier in the session. The benchmarks fell nearly $4 a barrel in the past two sessions, with Brent hitting seven-week lows under $47 and U.S. crude a one-month trough below $46. Tuesday's recovery came as the dollar retreated from three-month highs, making greenback-denominated crude more attractive to holders of the euro and other currencies. Risk appetite also rebounded across financial markets on reduced fears of contagion from last week's so-called Brexit. Sterling and London's FTSE 100 stock market index also recovered sharply on hopes of a coordinated central bank response to financial market losses. Some analysts were wary, saying more evidence of fundamental strength was needed to assure the market was on the path to a sustainable rally. Data showed oil production out of Nigeria, the focus on much supply outages over the past few months due to rebel attacks on oil infrastructure there, was back up at around 1.9 million barrels per day from an early June low of 1.6 million bpd. ""So far, I would categorize today's current move higher as a corrective move after the strong push lower since last Thursday,"" Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York, said, pinning a neutral to slightly bearish view on crude prices. ""More time is needed to safely say the down move in oil is officially over.""",0.0
"Cognigo raises $8.5M for its AI-driven data protection platform – TechCrunch. Cognigo, a startup that aims to use AI and machine learning to help enterprises protect their data and stay in compliance with regulations like GDPR, today announced that it has raised an $8.5 million Series A round. The round was led by Israel-based crowdfunding platform OurCrowd, with participation from privacy company Prosegur and State of Mind Ventures. The company promises that it can help businesses protect their critical data assets and prevent personally identifiable information from leaking outside of the company’s network. And it says it can do so without the kind of hands-on management that’s often required in setting up these kinds of systems and managing them over time. Indeed, Cognigo says that it can help businesses achieve GDPR compliance in days instead of months. To do this, the company tells me, it’s using pre-trained language models for data classification. That model has been trained to detect common categories like payslips, patents, NDAs and contracts. Organizations can also provide their own data samples to further train the model and customize it for their own needs. “The only human intervention required is during the systems configuration process, which would take no longer than a single day’s work,” a company spokesperson told me. “Apart from that, the system is completely human-free.” The company tells me that it plans to use the new funding to expand its R&D, marketing and sales teams, all with the goal of expanding its market presence and enhancing awareness of its product. “Our vision is to ensure our customers can use their data to make smart business decisions while making sure that the data is continuously protected and in compliance,” the company tells me.",0.0
"Gun Violence And Mental Health Laws, 50 Years After Texas Tower Sniper. For some people, the attack on police officers by a gunman in Dallas this summer brought to mind another attack by a sniper in Austin 50 years ago  —   on Aug. 1, 1966. That’s when student Charles Whitman stuck his rifle over the edge of the clock tower at the University of Texas and started shooting. Ultimately, he killed 16 people  —   and wounded more than 30 others. For decades, people have struggled to figure out why. There have been theories about abuse, a brain tumor and, of course, mental illness. Six months before Whitman took aim from that tower, he visited a school psychiatrist and admitted while there that he had a violent fantasy of going to the top of the tower with a deer rifle and shooting people. Gary Lavergne, who wrote A Sniper in the Tower, says the school psychiatrist, Dr. Maurice D. Heatly, claimed he’d had many students who recounted violent fantasies during therapy sessions. ”Today we take it a whole lot more seriously because of our history,” Lavergne says. ”But back then, that kind of thing didn’t happen.” Soon after the 1966 shooting, Heatly spoke in a news conference. ”It’s a common experience for students who come to the mental hygiene clinic to refer to the tower as the site of some desperate action,” Heatly told reporters. ”They say ’I feel like jumping off of the old tower.’ [Charles Whitman had] no psychosis symptoms at all!” Whitman never went back to the clinic but did return to his violent fantasy. Lavergne says the    Marine veteran and Eagle Scout was incredibly methodical as he went about killing his mother the night before the tower shootings, placing her body in bed as if she were sleeping. Then he went back home and stabbed his wife. ”By 3 o’clock in the morning, his wife and his mother are both murdered,” says Lavergne. ”After that, until he goes to the campus, he spent the rest of his time polishing, getting weapons ready, buying more ammunition. All for the specific goal of going to the top of the UT tower and shooting people.” Nearly two hours later, 16 people were dead   and 32 more were wounded. Police finally killed Whitman. Speaking to the media, John Connally, who was then governor of Texas, could barely find words. ”Of course I am concerned, disturbed, and yet somewhat at a loss to know how you prevent a maniacal act of a man who obviously goes berserk,” Connally said. Fifty years later, when news about shootings in Dallas, in Orlando or San Bernardino hits, our reactions are much the same. We use different words, but we often assume the shooter is mentally ill, and that crimes like this could be avoided if those with serious mental illness didn’t have guns. Which raises two questions: First, was Charles Whitman mentally ill? And second, could policies focusing on mental health prevent mass shootings? As to the first question, Lavergne doesn’t think Whitman had serious mental illness. Whitman, he says, did have mental health challenges that are common  —   depression and anxiety. But more than anything, he was manipulative. ”He was always who he was expected to be,” Lavergne says. ”In front of his    he at times appeared to be a dutiful husband, when  —   in fact  —   he assaulted his wife, just like his daddy assaulted his mother. And he gave people the impression he was an honor student, when  —   in fact  —   when he died he had a 1. 9 grade point average.” Charles Whitman did seem to think something was wrong with him. This is an excerpt from a note he left on his wife’s body: ”I don’t really understand myself these days,” he wrote. ”I’m supposed to be an average, reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately, I can’t recall when it started, I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur.” Whitman didn’t mention he’d also been abusing amphetamines. The potential impact of those chemicals fizzled out of the public conversation as soon as a pathologist made a striking discovery in his autopsy: a brain tumor. One doctor said the ”grayish yellow mass” wasn’t a factor in explaining what Whitman had done. But a medical panel later diagnosed the mass as a glioblastoma and said it could have contributed to Whitman’s inability to control his emotions and his actions. Dr. Elizabeth Burton, a Dallas pathologist, agrees it’s possible. ”You can have headaches, you can have seizures, and you can have changes in cognition, and you can actually have personality changes,” she says. But plenty of people have tumors and are not violent. And plenty of people have depression, anxiety and paranoia and aren’t violent. Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a psychiatrist and director of the division of law, ethics, and psychiatry at Columbia University, points out that only a tiny percent of violence  —   about 4 percent in the U. S.  —   is attributable to mental illness. ”We know that people with serious mental disorders are at somewhat elevated risk of committing violence,” Appelbaum says. ”Even so, the vast majority of them never commit a violent act. And we know that people with serious mental illnesses are much more likely to end up as victims of violence rather than as perpetrators.” But Democrats and Republicans both tout mental health care legislation as a way of preventing mass shootings. After a shooter killed 20 children in Newtown, President Obama called for a gun crackdown. That didn’t happen. But, Obama’s 2017 budget does include $500 million for mental health services. Appelbaum says this is a misguided approach. ”We need more funding for treatment of people with mental illness in this country,” Appelbaum says. ”But to argue for that funding on false grounds  —   namely to try and persuade the public that it will protect them [to] have more mental health clinics  —   in the long run can only backfire.” Applebaum believes there are alternatives. He says at least temporarily limiting access to guns for some people make sense. In general, people who have been convicted of violent misdemeanors, or who are a under temporary restraining order, or who have multiple DUI convictions over a   period are more likely to commit acts of violence than people with mental illness are.

"Parishioner charged in Mississippi church fire.  (CNN) A parishioner was arrested Wednesday and charged with intentionally setting fire last month to a Mississippi church, which was also vandalized with the words ”Vote Trump.” Andrew McClinton has been charged with one count of   arson of a place of worship in connection with the November 1 blaze at Hopewell Baptist Church, a predominantly black church in Greenville, the Greenville Police Department said. Authorities did not release a motive.  Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze after a 911 call reporting the fire at the     church came in around 9:15 p. m. No one was injured. The fire mostly damaged the sanctuary, pastor Carilyn Hudson said then.  Authorities had immediately concluded that the blaze had been intentionally set.  Vandals had also spray painted ”Vote Trump” on the exterior wall of the church in west Mississippi, near the Arkansas border.  Authorities are still trying to determine if McClinton is responsible for the vandalism, CNN affiliate WJTV in Jackson, Mississippi, reported Wednesday.  Greenville, a city of about 33, 000, is 78% black, according to the most recent census figures. Surrounding Washington County is 71% black.  Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons called the burning of the church ”a direct assault on the Hopewell congregation’s right to freely worship.” ”There is no place for this heinous and divisive behavior in our city,” he said in a statement. McClinton, who is from the Greenville area,  is a parishioner of the church of about 200 congregants, said Simmons’ chief of staff, Kenya Collins. He was arrested Wednesday afternoon, Collins said.  McClinton was awaiting his initial appearance in Greenville Municipal Court.  Several agencies, including the Greenville police, Greenville Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating. ",-1.0
" Democrats In Congress Are Pleading With Trump To Count LGBT Population In The Census.  More than   Democrats in Congress urged the Trump administration in a letter on Friday to figure out how many LGBT people live in the United States when conducting the next Census, a proposal that had been considered and then scrapped earlier this week. Lawmakers cited what they saw as hypocrisy on the part of John Thompson, director of the Census Bureau, who has said he wants a “complete and accurate census. ”“If this is indeed the goal, then the availability of data on the size, location, and circumstances of the LGBT population should be taken into account,” said the letter led by Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin along with Reps. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona and Adam Schiff of California. “Additionally, we are deeply troubled that in   statements, Director Thompson claims that the rationale for excluding LGBT identities is that there is no federal need for such information,” they add, noting, “We write to express our strong disapproval of the Census Bureau’s decision. ”The letter, which also asks about the American Community Survey, was also sent to Mick Mulvaney, who leads the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Congressional Democrats and several federal agencies during the Obama era  —  including the Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Justice Departments  —   asked that questions about sexual orientation and gender identity be included along with dozens of other questions. A preliminary draft of questions released this week for the 2020 Census included them however, a final draft sent to Congress on Tuesday did not. The Census Bureau issued a statement the next day saying there was an “error” in the early draft, and that to count populations, officials needed “a clear statutory or regulatory need for data collection. ” Censuses over the past decades have not asked about sexual orientation and gender identity. The next one will inquire about the marital status of   couples, per a 2013 decision under   Obama, but the lawmakers on Friday said that is not enough. “The fact remains that we know little else about the social and economic circumstances of the LGBT population at large,” their letter notes, adding that LGBT people disproportionately experience discrimination in housing and employment. “There is also compelling evidence that many, particularly transgender people, are at greater risk of being victimized by violence and experience significant health disparities and vulnerability to poverty,” the lawmakers continue. “Expanded data collection on LGBT people is needed to help policymakers and community stakeholders understand the full extent of these disparities, as well as identifying the needs of these communities so they can be better served. ”The members of Congress ask the administration to explain their decision, “including justification for stating there being no federal need for data on the LGBT population. ” Outside Your Bubble is a BuzzFeed News effort to bring you a diversity of thought and opinion from around the internet.

"Medicare and Social Security Trustees Warn of Shortfalls - The New York Times. WASHINGTON  —   The Obama administration said Wednesday that the financial outlook for Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund had deteriorated slightly in the last year and that Social Security still faced serious   financial problems. The report, from the trustees of the two programs, could inject a note of fiscal reality into a presidential campaign that has given scant attention to the government’s fiscal challenges as the population ages. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has proposed increasing Social Security benefits and allowing people age 55 to 64 to “buy into” Medicare, while Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has repeatedly said he would not cut either program. Under existing law, the trustees said Wednesday, Medicare’s hospital trust fund would be depleted in 2028, two years earlier than projected in last year’s report. In addition, they said, the Social Security trust funds for   benefits and disability insurance, taken together, could be depleted in 2034, the same year projected in last year’s report. Tax collections would then be sufficient to pay about   of promised benefits through 2090, they said. Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of all federal spending. Obama administration officials often say the Affordable Care Act has slowed the growth of health spending, compared with estimates made just before the law was adopted in 2010. But the trustees said Wednesday that the   financial outlook for Medicare had worsened in the last year because of changes in their assumptions and expectations. Medicare actuaries now expect higher use of inpatient hospital services, as well as lower projected improvements in workers’ productivity and lower payroll tax revenue, as a result of slower growth in wages in the next few years. In their report, the trustees  —   four administration officials  —   said that the costs of Medicare and Social Security would grow faster than the economy through the   because of the aging of the baby boom generation. As for Medicare, they said, “growth in expenditures per beneficiary exceeds growth in per capita gross domestic product over this time period. ” The projected growth in Medicare spending will not immediately set off automatic cuts in the program under a controversial provision of the Affordable Care Act that generally requires such cuts when spending is expected to exceed certain benchmarks. However, such cuts could be required in a few years under the trustees’ forecast. Under current projections, they said, the automatic cuts could take effect for the first time in 2019. Medicare now spends an average of nearly $13, 000 per beneficiary, and this figure is expected to exceed $16, 000 in five years, the report said. “  drugs are a major driver of Medicare spending growth,” said Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Such projections in years past have prompted leaders in both parties to at least broach the idea of benefit cuts or tax increases for entitlement programs. By contrast, President Obama said in Elkhart, Ind. this month that Social Security should be made “more generous,” and that “we could start paying for it by asking the wealthiest Americans to contribute a little bit more. ” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday that he saw no contradiction there. The two objectives  —   ensuring the solvency of Social Security and increasing benefits  —   are “not at all inconsistent” if they are discussed in the context of “a broader conversation” about taxes and benefits, he said. The report predicts that Social Security will provide a modest    adjustment, increasing benefits by   of 1 percent next year. But, it warned of a “substantial increase” in Medicare premiums in 2017 for about 30 percent of beneficiaries. Under assumptions in the report, the standard premium, now $121. 80 a month, would rise to $149, and the change could be announced just weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8. Congress took action last year to shore up Social Security’s disability insurance trust fund, but the report says the legislation was a   fix. The law postponed the projected depletion of the disability trust fund by seven years, to 2023, Mr. Lew said. Like other Democrats, Mr. Lew said the report showed the “positive impact” of the Affordable Care Act. Since the health law was signed, he said, “increases in health care costs have slowed substantially. ” Carolyn W. Colvin, the acting commissioner of Social Security, said Americans should begin a serious discussion of how to close the “future financing gap” in Social Security. Sixty million people now receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion each month. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is expected to reach 76 million by 2025.",-1.0
"A Dying Coal Town Falls Into ’Fracking Frenzy’ In ’Heat And Light’. ”More than most places, Pennsylvania is what lies beneath.” That’s a line Jennifer Haigh places at the beginning and the end of her latest novel, Heat and Light. Haigh knows a lot about ”what lies beneath” in Pennsylvania. She was born in the coal country of Western Pennsylvania and her 2005   novel, Baker Towers, traced the rise and fall of the fictional coal town, Bakerton, in the years following World War II. Haigh returned to Bakerton a few years ago in her short story collection, News From Heaven now, in Heat and Light she’s paying a more extended visit. For Haigh, Bakerton is becoming something akin to Faulkner’s apocryphal Yoknapatawpha County. It’s a place she’s brought to life so scrupulously that she can delve deep, both into the minds and family histories of her mostly   characters, as well as into the land itself and the stories it contains. Heat and Light is her most ambitious  —   and compelling  —   novel yet. What Tom Wolfe did for the New York City of the   ”  ’80s” in The Bonfire of the Vanities, Haigh does here for Bakerton  —   and the obscure   locales it’s based on  —   in this, our own era of ”fracking frenzy.” Heat and Light is an exquisitely designed,   social novel featuring a cast of at least 15 main characters. The central story revolves around fracking  —   the method by which natural gas trapped underground in shale rock is released through drilling and the injection of a   mixture of water, chemicals and sand. The novel opens in 2010, when a salesman comes to town representing a Texas company called Dark Elephant Energy. In simple   pitches, the salesman offers farmers around Bakerton a sweet deal, whereby Dark Elephant leases their land, drills into what he calls ”Nature’s   box” and releases the treasure of natural gas. He claims the drill will run so far beneath the land that farming can go on as usual. In return, the farmers get a leasing bonus up front and a percentage of future profits. Who would say no to such easy money, right? But the regrets skyrocket a couple of years later, after the tap water gets funky and residents begin suffering from rashes and boils, memory loss and miscarriages. After the natural gas boom goes bust and Dark Elephant drill workers (some of whom we’ve gotten to know) are laid off and stiffed on their last paycheck after the old hardwood forests are cut down and muddy clearings ”the size of . .. shopping mall[s] are carved out”  —   that’s when most folks in Bakerton realize they’ve been royally fracked. The challenge with such a political, and heavily populated novel like Heat and Light is to make us readers care to topple us from our Olympian condescension and get us to identify with these characters and the mistakes they make out of greed and need. As spectacular as Haigh’s panoramic social focus is in this novel  —   whisking us from Dark Elephant’s shareholders’ meeting in Houston into Bakerton’s taverns, the   the local   hangouts and storefront churches  —   she’s also superb at getting us into the nitty gritty of her character’s worldview, as well as their speech. Most Bakerton natives begin their sentences with the resigned preface, ”Anyways.” Chief among them is Rich Devlin, who has inherited his family’s property, but works as a prison guard because he can’t afford to farm. Rich’s father always told him that ”there are two kinds of work: the kind where you shower before and the kind where you shower after.” Rich can’t wait to scrub the prison smells off him every night. With the money from Dark Elephant, Rich thought he could finally quit the prison job and begin farming. But, now his water and land are polluted. He can’t even afford to sue. ”Anyways,” there are so many contractors and subcontractors involved, he wouldn’t know where to begin. In another one of her signature poetic pronouncements on her home territory, Haigh says: ”Rural Pennsylvania doesn’t fascinate the world, not generally. But cyclically, periodically, its innards are of interest. Bore it, strip it, set it on fire, a burnt offering to the collective need.” In Heat and Light, Haigh succeeds in making rural Pennsylvania  —   its land and people  —   plenty fascinating. Through the intimacy of her sweeping portrayal of Bakerton and the world beyond, she also compels readers to think about what we value and what possessions and dreams we sell off way too cheap.",-0.5
"Israel’s Parliament Draws a Line on Short Hemlines - The New York Times. JERUSALEM  —   How short is a short skirt and who gets to decide? These were the questions vexing members of the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, on Wednesday as dozens of female employees arrived in    attire to protest what they said was the Knesset guards’ sudden eagerness to enforce a longstanding dress code. Many aides also wore thick tights or black leggings, though it was unclear if that was a nod to modesty or the bad weather. The   code, which a Knesset spokesman said was recently “refreshed,” calls for dignified dress that becomes the place and bans items like shorts, ripped trousers, skimpy tops,   with political slogans, short skirts and dresses, and  . While many Knesset members and their aides said they supported the need for a dress code, they questioned the guards’ role as the arbiters of appropriate skirt length, comparing them to the modesty police in conservative religious societies. One employee cheekily said in a radio interview that she was considering looking into jobs in Iran’s Parliament. The dispute was amplified by the deeper cultural and religious wars roiling Israeli society, with women often on the front line. An    girl set off a national debate about religious extremism in 2011 after   men spit on her and cursed her because her modest dress did not conform to their rigorous rules. More recently, at the height of this summer’s debate in Europe over the    swimwear known as the burkini, an Israeli singer ran into trouble for wearing a bikini top at a beachside concert. And some rabbis and retired generals have objected to the proposed integration of the army’s tank crews, with one critic worrying that after nine months in a coed tank, “a little tank soldier would be born. ” The   skirmish burst into public conversation after the   Haaretz reported on the plight of Shaked Hasson, who was pictured in a slightly crumpled,    blue dress and was held up by Knesset guards for nearly an hour on Sunday until her boss, Merav Michaeli of the   Zionist Union, intervened. “Yes, yes, no less than five guards stood and visually measured up Shaked’s legs and decided that her attire did not allow her to enter the Knesset to do her job,” Ms. Michaeli, a feminist lawmaker, wrote in a Facebook post. Describing Ms. Hasson’s experience as “humiliating,” Ms. Michaeli added, “Respectful attire yes, but no to modesty patrols. ” Other female workers subsequently reported having been sent home to change clothes, saying they had frequently been allowed into work in the same garments before. Manuel Trajtenberg, another legislator from the Zionist Union, registered his objection on Wednesday after his parliamentary assistant was asked to remove her jacket for inspection. Mr. Trajtenberg took off his own shirt, revealing an underwear vest, and shouted, “You should all come in burqas, covered up completely,” referring to the   full Islamic veil and robe. The guards were prepared for Wednesday’s protest. Some women seeking entry in shortish skirts reported being examined scrupulously, with some female guards tugging at their hemlines. Tamar Ish Shalom, an anchorwoman on Israel’s Channel 10 news, posted pictures on Twitter of the British prime minister, Theresa May, in clothing that revealed her knees and some thigh. She wrote that she hoped Ms. May was not planning a visit to the Knesset, or “It could cause a diplomatic incident. ” The Knesset spokesman, Yotam Yakir, described Wednesday’s protest as a “provocation. ” “I am sure other parliaments in the world have a much stricter code,” Mr. Yakir said by telephone. “Here, jackets are not obligatory. We just don’t allow real minis, torn clothes, things like that. It is very elementary. It is not about gender. ” Israel is a casually dressed country, where shorts,   and sandals are common at weddings and funerals. But in September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kicked a minister, Haim Katz, out of a cabinet meeting for showing up in a striped polo shirt. The Knesset banned jeans in 2007, but later reversed course. Ms. Hasson, the aide whose case led to the protest, told the news site Ynet that she had been told hemlines could be no more than 5 centimeters above the knee, something Mr. Yakir said was incorrect. “There are no numbers or centimeters specified in the code,” he said. “It just says no short skirts. ”",-1.0
"Trump transition approval lower than Bush, Obama | TheHill. President-elect Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s transition approval rating is lower than those of past presidents, according to a Gallup poll released early Wednesday. Americans are split, with 48 percent approving Trump's transition and 48 percent disapproving. In December of 2008, 75 percent approved of President Obama’s transition, while a poll from early January of 2001 found that 65 percent of Americans approved of President George W. Bush’s transition.  The poll notes that one reason for Trump’s lower approval rating is Democratic opposition. Only 17 percent of Democrats approve of Trump’s transition, compared to 46 percent who approved of Bush’s transition in 2001. Trump has made multiple Cabinet announcements over the last several weeks, officially naming former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as his choice for Energy secretary early Wednesday. The president-elect is also in the midst of conducting a ""thank you"" tour in cities throughout the country.

"Father John Misty: Pure Comedy review – wonderfully uneasy listening. Towards the end of Pure Comedy’s   centrepiece track, Josh Tillman offers a glum assessment of the album’s commercial chances. His career’s current status, he claims, is under threat. “I’m beginning to begin to see the end of how it all goes down between them and me   Some     diatribe plays as they all jump ship,” he sings, eight verses into the     diatribe of Leaving LA. “‘I used to really like this guy   This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die. ’” Even if it seems unlikely that Pure Comedy is actually going to end Tillman’s career  —   numerous excitable reviews certainly suggest the opposite  —   you can see still why he might have had some trepidation about releasing it. On the surface, it doesn’t sound that different from his 2015 breakthrough album, I Love You, Honeybear. A little starker and more subtle, perhaps  —   the wilfully cluttered Phil   of its predecessor are largely confined to one track, Things It Would Have Been Helpful to Know Before the Revolution  —   but the main musical influence audibly remains the records Elton John made in his first flush of superstardom. As before, Captain Fantastic haunts the vocal melodies and their delivery throughout had lyricist Bernie Taupin had some kind of existential crisis during the making of Madman Across the Water, the results might have sounded like this. And it’s in the lyrics that the really dramatic, potentially alienating shift has taken place. I Love You, Honeybear and Father John Misty’s 2012 debut, Fear Fun, offered a very   spin on a   musical trope. He certainly sounded like an   confessional    —   his music frequently seemed like a product of   Los Angeles, where baring one’s soul became very big business indeed  —   but Tillman seemed to have changed the very notion of the confessional   to suit the   era. He wasn’t baring his soul, but singing in character a character he claimed had come to him in a   vision, no less, and who occasionally referred to Josh Tillman as another person. Or, at least, he was some of the time. On I Love You, Honeybear’s collection of love songs, scabrous   and     addresses, it was virtually impossible to grasp what was heartfelt and what was arch: reviewers trying to evaluate its lead track, Bored in the USA, couldn’t seem to work out whether it was searing satire or painful honesty. Pure Comedy still has odd moments you might usefully describe using the prefix “meta” not least The Memo, on which the lyrics unexpectedly dissolve into the kind of needy questionnaire manufacturers email you after you buy something online. “Do you usually listen to music like this?” “Can we recommend some similar artists?” it asks, while a robotic voice mouths platitudes: “This is my song of the summer   …     This guy really gets me. ” But mainly, the sense of ironic distance  —   the feeling that it might all be a big joke on Tillman’s part  —   is noticeable by its absence. Instead, there’s an unpalatable assessment of modern life, devoid of the canned laughter that muddied the similarly themed Bored in the USA. You could argue that what he has to say isn’t exactly new. He’s certainly not the first person to inform us that the planet is doomed, that the population is becoming increasingly disconnected and immune to horror, that we’re   with vapid entertainment and   with a sense of our own importance (“the homophobes, hipsters and 1%   The false feminists he’s managed to detect   Oh, who will critique them once he’s left?” ponders the social   titular character in Thoughts of a Dying Man) that politicians are venal and   that religion is a waste of time but humanism doesn’t look too appealing either, given how stupidly humans behave. But it’s hard to think of anyone who’s done it this potently. The lyrics teem with flashes of black humour (in the   world conjured in Things It Would Have Been Helpful to Know Before the Revolution, where humans are hunted down as they scavenge for food, “we’re all still pretty good at eating on the run”) while the kind of pomposity that usually accompanies grand statements such as these, replete with references to Sophocles and Dante and The Book of Revelations, is ameliorated by Tillman’s scourging  : “Oh great, that’s just what we all need  —   another white guy in 2017 who takes himself so goddam seriously. ” It’s also hard to think of anyone who has done it with better tunes: a great deal of the album’s power comes from the way the bleakness of the lyrics is offset by the lusciousness of the melodies and the comforting familiarity of the sound, with its acoustic guitars and beautifully subtle orchestrations. There’s something hugely impressive about coming up with an album that somehow manages to be both incredibly discomfiting and easy to listen to. For all the debt to Elton, the 70s work Pure Comedy most recalls in mood is Neil Young’s mournful On the Beach, another LA album thick with apocalyptic visions, dire premonitions about America’s future, savage wit and glum assessments of commercial success. Certainly, its overall message doesn’t seem that different from Young’s mournful    parting shot: “You’re all just pissing in the wind. ” That album functioned as a catharsis: Young’s work was never as bleak again. Whether Pure Comedy serves the same purpose for Tillman remains to be seen. “Hate to say it, but each other’s all we’ve got,” sings Tillman on Pure Comedy’s title track: it’s hard to work out whether that represents a sliver of hope amid the darkness, or if it’s the most damning line of all.",-0.5
"Welsh town opts for ’Brexit’ despite flow of EU funds.  (CNN) Why would a Welsh town that receives a huge investment from the European Union vote to leave it? That’s the question that journalists, pundits and Remain voters have been trying to answer since Ebbw Vale, a town in southern Wales, came out against staying in the EU last month. Wales, a net beneficiary when it comes to EU funding, voted to leave in the June 23 referendum. In the Ebbw Vale area, the unemployment level is twice as high as the national average (5%) immigration is relatively low and the fruits of EU investment is visible for all to see. But 62% of voters there backed the Leave campaign. Head to the site of the town’s old steelworks    now a    art ”learning zone” with a huge sports center    and it becomes apparent where much of the funding has gone. According to the local council, the area received $9. 68 million (£7. 3 million) from the EU between 2007 and 2013 to invest in education, not just for schools but also for additional education facilities and training. ’Stupid thing’ The EU has pumped in $192 million (£145 million) since the steelworks closed in 2002 and brought an end to the local area’s main source of income.  The town center boasts a brand new silver statue of a dragon    the Welsh national symbol    and shiny silver balls that line the main street.  Both were built with $5. 9 million (£4. 5 million) in EU funds for physical improvements to the town’s center.  Then there is the $105 million (£79 million) in EU funds that supported development of a new divided highway between Tredegar and Brynmawr, which has opened up employment and business opportunities across the South Wales Valleys. Add that to a new railway line and $16. 2 million (£12. 2 million) for upgrades and improvements in the town center. And EU funds have helped create 1, 100 jobs in the local area, according to the Welsh government.  Still, when asked why they voted for ”Brexit,” many locals pointed to sovereignty and border control.   Deb Phillips, who voted to leave, told CNN she was ”sick of being told where the money’s got to be spent,” with the dragon in the town center the focus of her ire. Alan Jones, who voted to remain, said the EU investment won’t be replaced equally by the British government. ”It’s a stupid thing to do because once you go, this money is gone,” Jones said of the decision to leave the EU.",-1.0
"It’s right to end the ban on trans people in the military – but wrong to set conditions. Open trans service in the military is a necessary step toward protecting and recognizing the humanity of trans people, but the military’s proposal falls far short of what is needed. When I first heard about Thursday’s announcement I was grinding and sanding metal to a polish at my prison job. The news was both a relief and reminder of how little we can count on the principles of equality and institutions like the military to bring justice to our community. Even within the military inclusion framework, many issues remain unresolved and concerning. Right away, something didn’t sit right with me. We don’t need the military to be the gatekeeper of our gender expression and identity. We should be able to define ourselves. The policy outlined by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter would require new recruits to be “stable in their identified gender for 18 months, as certified by their doctor, before they can enter the military”. How many young trans people like myself fit this criteria? The idea of having a gender certification process is a misuse of the medically accepted standards of care. What is the stability of gender? Isn’t gender an inherently unstable concept  —   always being constrained by the various context and rules under which we live? I worry that this type of requirement will further entrench the gender binary and further legitimize the control that administrators and medical providers have over our bodies and our identities. And what about those of us who are incarcerated? Will these rules apply to us? I am deeply concerned that like so many policies, the impact of this change won’t penetrate the prison walls. What does it mean that the military will recognize our gender, unless and until we are arrested, and then what? This core identity is then stripped away and our birth assigned sex is imposed on us? But defining ourselves for who we are is one of the most powerful and important rights that we have as human beings. No one knows my gender more than I do. You do not know my gender better than I do. A doctor doesn’t know it better than I do. My parents don’t know it better than I do. No one experiences my gender in the way that I experience it. Presenting myself and my gender is about my right to exist. With this policy, the military is essentially saying “you can exist, but only on our terms”. What they are doing is taking away the control of our identity. Gender presentation should reflect the person that you are. When you lose control of your gender presentation you lose an important aspect of your identity and existence. By setting so many caveats, time lines, standards, and training, the military is making this far, far, more complicated and bureaucratic than it needs to be. The simple reality is that we are who we say we are. When it comes to trans inclusion in the military, at this point, there are still too many questions. We don’t yet know whether this policy of “inclusion” will be in name only and whether medical providers and commanders will find ways to push us out, dehumanize us and cast us as freaks. Of course, this is not the first time the military has confronted its own entrenched prejudice. But if history is any guide  —   for instance the racial and gender integrations of the 20th century  —   the US armed forces are more than capable of overcoming such obstacles. No matter how this shift in policy rolls out, I hope that we remember that if our most powerful institutions cannot take us on our own terms, then perhaps we should fight to change those institutions.

"How Le Wagon is quietly becoming a major coding bootcamp in Europe – TechCrunch. Slowly but surely, French startup Le Wagon is becoming a leading coding bootcamp in Europe. Not only the company is executing quickly and expanding to a bunch of new cities, but Le Wagon is also refining its approach to coding bootcamps by using technology as much as possible. Le Wagon started in Paris more than two years ago. Only 15 students took part in the first class. I covered the startup back in 2014. It has been a slow and steady growth story since then. But things seem to be accelerating in 2016. 500 students have learned to code thanks to Le Wagon. Attending Le Wagon costs around €5,000 depending on the city — it turns out coding bootcamps can be a lucrative business. And right now, dozens of students are learning to code in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Lille, Bordeaux, Marseille and Beirut. The company will soon open shop in London, Lisbon, Copenhagen, Nantes, Lyon and three cities in Brazil. All of this without having raised any money. Attending Le Wagon takes two months and you learn back-end and front-end coding, database stuff as well as a bit of project management. After two months, you should be ready to dive deeper, learn other languages and tackle projects on your own. In Paris, between two different batches of students, the team works on improving its tech platform. Little by little, Le Wagon is building an all-in-one teaching solution for coding skills. Then any developer can become a teacher just by following the syllabus and making students work on the exercise platform. And this is key to understanding Le Wagon’s success. With this approach, the company can create a uniformized coding school in many different cities with a hands-off approach. This looks like a good way to scale. And it seems to be working as student feedback has been really positive. And the fact that the company hasn’t raised any money also means that the company doesn’t feel the pressure to grow too quickly. But based on my interactions with Le Wagon, they’re an ambitious team and don’t want to be known as “that little coding school in France.” London could be a major stepping stone as it’s a more competitive market.",0.0
"Is it time to switch from iOS to Android?. Apple is about to unveil its latest smartphone, likely to be called the iPhone 7. Plenty of owners of older iPhones will be eager to upgrade, but what if you’re losing faith in Apple’s flagship device? According to research firm Gartner, Android accounts for 86. 2% of new smartphone sales, with impressive handsets from Samsung, Motorola and Google tempting people away from iOS. Considering making the switch? Here are answers to some of the questions you might have. You will have to learn a few different conventions on Android, but the basic vocabulary of tapping and swiping is the same, as is the structure of apps and folders on your home screen. The major difference in Android is a few extra onscreen buttons. The universal “back” button takes you to the previous page or app, while the “overview” button pops up previews of all your running apps, so you can switch between them. No you can keep them by copying them from iCloud into your Google account. Apple has a guide for exporting your address book as a vCard file via the iCloud website. Safari bookmarks can be synced with Google’s Chrome browser: search the Chrome web store for “iCloud Bookmarks” to find the necessary  . Syncing your iOS calendar with Google Calendar is even easier on your iPhone, go to Settings, Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then select or set up your Google account and turn on the switch next to Calendars. If you use WhatsApp or other popular messaging apps, these are all available on Android too: your friends won’t even know you’ve switched. There is one potential gotcha, however. iMessage is an   feature that automatically routes text messages over the internet where possible. After you’ve switched to Android, it’s possible that incoming text messages to your phone number will continue being diverted to the iMessage network, meaning you won’t receive them. To ensure your settings update, visit Apple’s help page and remove yourself from iMessage manually. There are few   apps that don’t support Android, from games and social apps to productivity tools, even if new releases sometimes still come earlier to iOS. Certain genres still suffer on Android in comparison to iOS. For example,   should be warned there is still no real alternative to Apple’s GarageBand on Android or the many   audio tools that exist on iOS. There is also no direct equivalent to Apple’s iMovie, although there are a growing number of   tools on Android that handle parts of that app’s features. Not at all. In the early days of iTunes, its downloads could only be played on Apple hardware. Anything you’ve bought since 2009 will be in the unrestricted M4A format though, which can easily be converted into MP3s that will play on any Android phone. Streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer are available on Android, as is Apple Music, so you can sign in on your new phone and access all your old playlists. Apple might think so, but there are Android phones with cameras as good as the iPhone’s  —   or better. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 has a wider lens aperture than the iPhone 6 and 6S, for example, plus optical image stabilisation for steadier shots. If you’re worried about losing the photos from your iPhone camera roll, you can export them on to your computer or install the Google Photos app on iOS to upload them to your Google account. Android gives app developers a lot of freedom, which means you can apply cool customisations that aren’t possible on iOS, such as   widgets on the home screen. But yes, this means Android phones are more vulnerable to malware attacks. In theory, a malicious app could snoop on your banking details, lock up your data or run up huge bills by silently calling   numbers when you’re not looking. Don’t panic, though  —   such outbreaks are rare and a little common sense goes a long way. Don’t install apps from unfamiliar sites  —   stick to the official Google Play store and, ideally, stick to established apps with plenty of positive user reviews. If you prefer to use iTunes on your desktop, then switching will demand a certain adjustment of your habits  —   there’s no comparable “central control panel” for Android. Your settings and content are managed from within the relevant apps and websites. However, if you want to drag and drop files manually from your desktop on to a connected Android phone, you can do it using Google’s standalone Android File Transfer tool for the Mac. It works the other way too, so you can keep copies of your   photos and music or take your pick from the many backup apps on Google Play, both free and  . Apple’s Touch ID sensor is a great piece of technology, but there are plenty of Android phones with similar thumbprint scanners, the Nexus 5X and 6P for example, which can be used in the same way to unlock the phone and authorise purchases from Google Play. As for Night Shift, the feature in iOS 9. 3 that tints the screen at night to help your brain wind down and sleep better, Google is working on something similar but it hasn’t yet been officially baked into the operating system. Google Play offers a selection of apps that can do the same thing. Twilight is one highly rated option that’s free to download  —   so you don’t need to lose sleep over switching. Bluetooth accessories such as headphones and speakers should work perfectly well on Android, while health and fitness trackers tend to support both Android and iOS with their apps. Anything with a Lightning connector, however, is sadly a  : the plugs and sockets are patented, so you can’t hook them up to a   device. It’s a similar situation if you’ve splashed out on an Apple Watch. Despite speculation that Apple might open the watch up to work with Android smartphones, it remains   for now. The good news is that if you can’t live without a smartwatch, there’s a good range of Android Wear devices out there for less than £100. Many of the reassurances above apply just as well the other way, from apps to music. Apple has also launched an Android app called Move to iOS that migrates your photos, messages, contacts and bookmarks to an iPhone.",-0.5
"Wells Fargo launches 3% down payment mortgage. First-time buyers and low- to moderate-income buyers have largely been sidelined by today's housing recovery. The common cry is too-tight credit. Lenders have kept the credit box restrictive because they are gun-shy from the billions of dollars in buy backs and judicial settlements stemming from the mortgage crisis that they still face today. Now, the nation's largest lender, Wells Fargo, says it is opening that box with a new low down payment loan — a loan it claims is low-risk to the bank. ""We are fully underwriting the borrowers, we are partnering with Fannie Mae to originate and sell these loans, we are ensuring the borrowers have an ability to repay and that they're qualified for home ownership, but we're simplifying things for the homebuyer,"" said Brad Blackwell, executive vice president and portfolio business manager at Wells Fargo. Branded ""yourFirstMortgage,"" Wells Fargo's new product has a minimum down payment of 3 percent for a fixed-rate conventional mortgage of up to $417,000. Down payment help can come from gifts and community-assistance programs. Customers are not required to complete a homebuyer education course, but if they do, they may earn a 1/8 percent interest rate reduction. The minimum FICO score for these loans, which are underwritten according to Fannie Mae standards, is 620. Mortgage insurance can either be rolled in to the cost of the loan or purchased separately by the borrower. Blackwell said either way, the monthly payment is less than a government-insured FHA loan. More importantly, it's simpler than other 3 percent down payment products already in the market, some of which have specific income and counseling requirements. ""We've taken all the complexity of the home mortgage lending process, removed it from the front-line consumer, so that it's easy for them to understand and Wells Fargo is taking care of all the capital markets and other types of complexities behind the scenes,"" added Blackwell. Other 3 percent down payment products from Bank of America with Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae's HomeReady program have not been popular because lenders find them bureaucratic and hard to use. ""To the extent that Wells is using this product as liberally as they can, that's a positive for most borrowers,"" said Guy Cecala, CEO of Inside Mortgage Finance. Cecala, however, questions whether any borrower with a 620 FICO score would really qualify for Wells' program. Other programs have that minimum, but the average borrower score on loans actually made is closer to 750. ""I don't know what offsetting factors you have for a 620 credit score with such a low down payment. Unless you require them to have a million dollars in the bank, I'm not sure what else you can do,"" said Cecala, who notes that a 620 credit score usually denotes someone who has an inability to manage credit. ""I think it's problematic to make a loan to borrowers in a subprime credit range with a very low down payment like 3 percent down."" Wells Fargo will service the loans, but Fannie Mae will buy them, and that means the loans must be underwritten to Fannie Mae's standards, which are high. Jonathan Lawless, vice president of product development at Fannie Mae, admits that a borrower with a 620 score would be unlikely to qualify. ""It is true that it's a rare event that we see borrowers at that low a FICO score,"" he said. ""There needs to be compensating factors — one is to have a lot of money in the bank or a very good debt to income ratio."" In other words, the borrower would have to have a very high income to negate the credit risk. Lawless does think the Wells Fargo loan will be far more popular than others on the market because of the financial incentive for homeowner education, the lack of restrictions on funding the down payment and the sheer simplicity of the product. Liking the loan is easy enough, but for first-time, low- to moderate-income borrowers, qualifying for the loan may be harder. ""Loans today are remarkably safe because the underwriting has improved so much. That will be the test with this,"" said Cecala.",0.0
"Alive Since The 1600s, An Oak Tree Is Taken Down In Washington, D.C.. Generations have come and gone under its branches. Its leaves soaked up rays from the sun that shone on the American Colonies. But after an estimated 325 years of life, an oak tree in a residential neighborhood in Washington, D. C. has now fallen victim to time. Dana Ju, whose young family had been the latest to play under the tree’s broad canopy on Washington’s Floral Street, says they’re ”very sad about the tree but feel very fortunate we were not inside our home when it fell.” The red oak had grown to a height of 75 feet, and it seems that its size might have been its undoing. After a crack formed in its massive trunk, arborists determined there was no way to save the tree  —   and even before crews could begin dismantling it, part of the tree broke off. By then, Ju and her family had moved out temporarily, and neighbors had moved their cars as a precaution. The tree was removed from its spot between two houses in northwest D. C. this week, as member station WAMU’s Martin Austermuhle reports. ”Removing the damaged tree took eight hours and a crew of half a dozen, and involved a crane removing two upper sections that combined weighed over 30, 000 pounds,” Austermuhle says. Arborist John Anna, president of Adirondack Tree Experts, tells WAMU, ”This guy is an anomaly.” The tree’s age was estimated by counting the rings in its trunk and by comparing its   diameter to the average growth rates for red oaks. Here’s a sense of the span of time covered by the oak from when it first grew in what is now the Shepherd Park neighborhood: For centuries, the tree withstood weather and man. As Austermuhle notes, the oak on Floral Street kept on growing, despite Britain’s fiery attack on the White House in 1814 and the Confederate Army’s attack on Fort Stevens, only a mile south, in 1864.",-0.5
"Developer DICE Moving on from ’Star Wars Battlefront’ to Sequel - Breitbart. It seems DICE is done with their inaugural entry in the Star Wars Battlefront series, and is now putting all of its focus on the 2017 sequel. [“DICE isn’t done with Star Wars,” the developer posted on EA’s official Battlefront blog, but the team behind 2015’s reboot of the cult classic multiplayer games has “shifted its focus” toward “the next great Star Wars game. ” This is, of course, the inevitable Battlefront 2.  DICE isn’t hogging all the credit  —   or blame, depending on your opinion of 2015’s Battlefront. They’ve called their next release a “collaborative effort” between themselves and the teams at developers Criterion and Motive. According to Motive’s Jade Raymond: A new installment of Star Wars Battlefront is currently in development at DICE, in collaboration with Motive Studios in Montreal. Our team at Motive team is growing quickly, and making great progress in building out a significant new addition to the game. While we’re not ready to get into specifics right now, we have started development of this game by listening to all of the feedback we received, while also innovating in new areas I think you’re all going to be excited about. While DICE’s announcement means that we won’t see any further content added to the offline Skirmish mode introduced to Battlefront last year, 2017’s   will feature a full single player campaign that spans “multiple Star Wars eras,” according to EA CEO Andrew Wilson himself during an earnings call on January 31: Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new   campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. Star Wars Battlefront was a hopeful first attempt, a   to the sights and sounds of the iconic series. Unfortunately, even CFO Blake Jorgensen was forced to admit that it didn’t have enough depth to hold on to many of its most hardcore players. It was a game as praised as it was maligned, prioritizing atmosphere and accessibility over longevity. Despite its many criticisms, fans devoured it. It sold upwards of 14 million copies. The next game is doubling down on scope and depth alike, and EA is devoting those three studios to make sure it succeeds. Wilson said that they “have every reason to believe” that they’ll be able to deliver “exactly what fans are asking for. ” Star Wars Battlefront 2 will release some time in late 2017, probably in the vicinity of Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi’s theatrical premier in December.

"US Q4 revised GDP up 1.0% vs 0.4% growth expected. U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as initially thought, with businesses less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory, which could hurt output in the first three months of 2016. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.0 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its second GDP estimate. Economists polled by Reuters had expected that fourth-quarter GDP growth would be revised down to a 0.4 percent pace. The economy grew at a rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter. Businesses accumulated $81.7 billion worth of inventory rather than the $68.6 billion reported last month. That reflected an upward revision to inventory valuation adjustment.percent rate. The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining, utilities and construction. As a result, inventories subtracted only 0.14 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.45 percentage point. The bigger inventory build is bad news for first-quarter GDP growth as it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders, which will continue to hold down production. First-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as a 2.5 percent rate, but the risks are tilted to the downside amid slowing world economies, a strong dollar and a recent global stock market sell-off that has tightened financial market conditions. Cheap oil has also been a drag on the profits of oil field companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton, prompting them to slash capital expenditure budgets. The upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP growth also reflected a smaller trade deficit than initially thought as imports contracted. The trade deficit subtracted 0.25 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the 0.47 percentage point reported last month. Business spending on equipment contracted at a less steep 1.8 percent rate last quarter, compared to the previously reported 2.5 percent rate. There were minor downward revisions to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 2.0 percent pace rather than the 2.2 percent rate reported last month. Unusually mild weather hurt sales of winter apparel in December and undermined demand for heating through the quarter. But there are signs consumption picked up in January with the return to more normal winter temperatures. With gasoline prices around $2 per gallon, a tightening labor market gradually lifting wages and house prices boosting household wealth, the fundamentals for consumer spending remain very strong. Business spending on nonresidential structures contracted at a 6.6 percent rate rather than the 5.3 percent pace the government reported last month. Government spending contracted at a 0.1 percent rate instead of rising at a 0.7 percent rate.",0.0
"Did Latinos tip Trump over the edge? Experts dispute what happened. Polls and punditry predicted a Latino surge would clinch Hillary Clinton’s election but now the question is whether Latinos helped put Donald Trump in the White House. Exit polls suggest 29% voted for the Republican  —   a higher margin than Mitt Romney won in 2012 and perhaps enough to have tipped the scales in battleground states. That possibility sent analysts scrambling on Wednesday to plumb the numbers and ponder the psyche of an ethnic minority which Trump was deemed to have insulted and provoked. CNN’s exit poll found that 65% of Latinos voted for Clinton while 29% cast their votes for Trump. In 2012 Barack Obama won 71% of the Latino vote and Romney won 27%. The number crunching site FiveThirtyEight said this may have tilted Florida’s 29 electoral college votes into the column of a candidate who called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and vowed to deport millions of undocumented people. “Trump’s margin among Latino voters in Florida, though thinner than it has been for Republican candidates in past races, likely helped him win that critical state. ” However Latino Decisions, a leader in Latino political opinion research, disputes CNN’s exit poll and thinks a Latino surge did in fact happen. The firm’s analysis of actual voting results in 12 states suggested Latinos voted in record numbers and gave Clinton a thumping majority.  “We think it was 79% for Clinton and 18% for Trump,” Matt Barreto, the firm’s   told the Guardian. “We think there’s a 0% chance that Trump did better than Romney in 2012. His negative numbers were through the roof. It was very strong for Clinton and turnout was higher. ”  These results, if confirmed, would broadly match   polls by Latino Decisions, NBC, Univision, Telemundo and the Washington Post. Critics of Latino Decisions say the firm’s methodology lacks transparency and on occasion may favour clients’ wishes. Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center, had frustrating news for those demanding instant answers: voting results do not convey ethnic data so a full analysis must await next year’s census survey. However exit polls did suggest there was increase in the Latino vote and that Clinton did about as well as Obama in 2008, said Lopez.  Trump may have outperformed Romney, he added. “It’s possible he did as well or possibly better. ” If so that would underline the fact Latinos are not monolithic, said Lopez. “The Latino vote is a diverse vote with many different points of view. Many are military veterans. Many are born in the US and far from Latino roots. Many are evangelicals. So the diversity of the Hispanic electorate can explain some of these results. ”  Latinos who prefer English to Spanish may have proved more receptive to Trump. One example was Noemi Martinez, 58, and her mother Noemi Garza, 76, who voted in Phoenix, Arizona. “I voted for Donald Trump because he’s a businessman and knows how to get things done,” said Martinez. “Hillary has been there so many years and what has she done? She lies. All of my sons and sisters are voting for Trump. He has a few issues but people change. Hopefully he’ll do the right thing once he gets into the White House. I figure it’s take a liar or take a chance and I figure take a chance. ” Garza, in contrast, voted for Clinton. Latino activists, who had expected to bask in the glory of clinching a Clinton victory, were grappling with Trump’s stunning win on Wednesday. They had promised a wall of Latino votes to demolish Trump and his promise of walling off the southern border. “We’ll still need to see the results as they come in but I doubt the exit polls were correct,” said Lizet Ocampo, director of the People For the American Way’s Latino vote programme. She predicted that final results would show a record Latino turnout voted overwhelmingly for Clinton.  That would explain why Arizona, where activists registered 150, 000 new voters, turfed out Sheriff Joe Arpaio and edged the red state closer to purple, she said. “We made inroads. ” In 2012 only about half of the US’s eligible Latino voters voted  —   far below white and African Americans  —   partly because of poverty, political disengagement and lack of confidence in English. “We need more resources and more work because the gap is so large,” said Ocampo. She offered one source of consolation: after Californians approved a crackdown on illegal immigration in 1994 Latinos organised and turned demographic heft into political power, gradually transforming the state of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into a Democratic stronghold. The prospect of a grinding, generational battle of mobilisation and attrition to turn the tide offered little comfort to activists across the US who found their election parties turning to wakes. The mood in the offices of Somos Orlando, a Florida activist group, started high with song, dance, food and wine. People seemed jubilant, almost euphoric they talked of saving the country from the clutches of a man they feared. The mood dropped to disappointment and finally tumbled into a sense of betrayal by friends and neighbors. How, they wondered, could so many have backed Trump despite what they saw as his xenophobic views? “Do you want to go home?” Nancy Sharifi asked her husband, Farid. She’s from Puerto Rico, he’s from Iran. They sat on a sofa together, and his    eyelids had started to droop. “I don’t want to go because you’ll fall asleep and I’ll be depressed by myself. ” The couple watched with horror as Trump’s red influence spread from the eastern seaboard through the center of the country, into the west. Hillary Clinton was doomed. A note of fear crept into their conversation. “You know he said he’s going to cut funding to places that harbor immigrants?” she said. “I know. That’s why he’s winning. ” The unprecedented turnout in Florida’s rural areas, Nancy suspected, was a response to growing Latino communities farther south. “It’s . .. ” She searched her English for the word. “It’s xenophobic. It’s a reaction against people who look different. People who have accents. I’m worried  —   very, very worried  —   for Muslims in the country. ” Farid pinned his hopes on a younger generation. “The millennials. They can take it back. ”",-0.5
" Planned Parenthood’s President: ""It’s Time For Ivanka To Stand For Women"".  Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards urged Ivanka Trump on Friday to step into the debate over the Republican health care bill. The president’s daughter’s silence on the way the legislation would affect women has been “deafening,” she said, and that “it’s time for Ivanka to   …     stand for women. ” Ivanka is currently on a ski vacation with her family in Aspen. The bill, which would remove federal requirements to provide services like maternity care, and would block federal funding for Planned Parenthood, is scheduled to go for a vote later Friday. Richards also targeted members of congress, and female Republicans in particular, with her remarks. “Any woman who votes for this bill is betraying every woman in America,” she said. “Women will not just lose their healthcare, but lose their lives over this bill. ” Richards comments came during a BuzzFeed News interview with    Ben Smith. And in response to a tweet from President Donald Trump on Friday morning, Richards called the health care bill “the most   bill that I have ever seen. ” “It’s wildly unpopular,” Richards said. “This is going to be a catastrophe for women in this country,” she said, especially those who are underprivileged. She also said her group may go to court if it becomes law. The health care bill that’s scheduled to come up for a crucial vote in the House today  —   though it’s unclear when  —   includes a provision to remove all federal funding from the women’s health  . Currently, no federal funds are permitted to be used on abortions  —   they go toward reimbursing Planned Parenthood for covering other services under Medicaid, like STI tests and cancer screenings. It’s unclear if the bill  —   which would repeal and replace President Obama’s Affordable Care Act  —   has the votes to pass, as several   and moderate members say they will oppose the bill. “It’s pretty clear they would do anything to pass this disastrous plan  …    to see the photographs of the Freedom Caucus, this supposedly   group literally bargaining away the rights to maternity care benefits, birth control benefits,” Richards said. President Trump’s tweet on Friday morning used the Planned Parenthood defunding as a wedge to get holdouts from the Freedom Caucus  —   several staunchly conservative representatives who widely oppose the bill  —   to embrace it. “The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very   and against Planned Parenthood, allows P. P. to continue if they stop this plan!” Trump tweeted. Richards added that the   “deal” Trump supposedly proposed to Planned Parenthood  —   giving them more money if they stopped providing abortions  —   was “not a deal” at all, she said. “There was no deal,” she said, adding that she never spoke directly with the President but just read about him saying that in the New York Times, like everyone else. “We would never betray women and abandon that care,” Richards said. “It was clearly an attempt to divide people [supporting] Planned Parenthood,” she said, but emphasized that it did not work. And when asked if she thinks the abortion rate will increase if the bill passes, she said, “It has every other time and every other place” in countries where abortion was made unavailable.  ",-1.0
"’Imploded’: ’Hateful Eight’ Is Cop-Hater Tarantino’s Lowest Solo-Grosser In 20 Years - Breitbart. Over the weekend, using science, math and    examples, I made the case that there is no reason, outside of a series of public relations catastrophes, for the box office disaster that is Quentin Tarantino’s “The Hateful Eight. ” What’s going to be fascinating now is how the Hollywood Media spins it. Box Office Mojo has declared the patient dead, all that’s left is the autopsy:  Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight imploded as the filmmaker’s latest film fell short of expectations last weekend and now, in its second weekend in wide release, it has dropped 59. 6%. Even worse, that drop comes as the film expanded into 464 additional theaters. With an estimated $6. 3 million this weekend the film is up to $41. 4 million domestically and looking to top out around $50 million or so. If “the Hateful Eight” does indeed bottom out at $50 million, it will rank as Tarantino’s lowest solo box office performance since “Jackie Brown” hit $40 million in 1997. (The experimental “Grindhouse,” which Tarantino   with a handful of others, earned $25 million in 2007.) “Hateful Eight cost around $50 million to produce. Add another $25 to $35 million for promotion and advertising. If the Weinstein Company is going to break even, this dog will have to gross somewhere around $150 to $175 million worldwide.  And judging from the results of the Golden Globes, there will be no Oscar boost. At this same time in 2012, “Django Unchained” sat at $106 million. At this same time in 2009, “Inglorious Basterds” sat at $73 million. Currently, “The Hateful Eight” sits at a calamitous $41 million and has already run out of steam. Gee, I wonder what changed between “Django Unchained” and “The Hateful Eight?”   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC                  ",1.0
"Two questions Trump must answer if he wants to drain the tax swamp. “Historic” “massive” “phenomenal”. Donald Trump has pulled out all his increasingly tired superlatives to describe his plans for reforming the byzantine and bonkers US tax system. Well, good luck with that. As he ponders his next move at    this Easter weekend, Trump will do well to remember that tax reform has a way of leaving a president with egg on his face. It’s not without reason that no    has achieved it since Ronald Reagan, in 1986.  Reagan, wildly popular, didn’t pass tax reform until his second term and it took 10 tense months to pull it off. Trump, who is wildly unpopular and has yet to even appoint most of the people who would do the heavy lifting on tax reform, wants it done by summer. Say what you like about Trump, he doesn’t lack ambition. When he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, Jimmy Carter (the  ) called the US tax code “a disgrace to the human race”.  “All my life I have heard promises about tax reform,” he said, “but it never quite happens. With your help, we are finally going to make it happen. And you can depend on it. ”  Forty years on, the federal tax code covers close to 75, 000 pages, 187 times longer than it was a century ago.  The main problem, according to Cato Institute senior fellow Michael Tanner, is that tax reform lies at the heart of Washington’s quagmire. “The tax code isn’t just part of the Washington swamp,” Tanner wrote recently. “It is the swamp. ” But to hear it from the Trump camp, tax is easy. After the failure to “repeal and replace” Obamacare, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin recently told a group of financial journalists: “Healthcare is a very, very complicated issue. In a way, [tax reform is] a lot simpler. It really is. ”  Few beyond the Trumposphere would agree. But don’t worry, dear reader. As Richard Rubin, the Wall Street Journal’s tax wonk, recently pointed out, while tax policy is labyrinthine, tax reform stories are actually simple. In fact, there are only four: “It’s hard” “What does X mean for reform?” “What does reform mean for X?” “Check out weird tax thing”. When it comes to taxes, though, we’re all in favor of simplification. Right? So let’s cut Rubin’s Rules down to two: “Why is it hard?” and “What does X mean for reform?” Those are the two questions that, in the weeks to come, will keep the president padding through the corridors of power, into the wee small hours. The White House needs a big win after its humiliating defeat over healthcare reform. In principle, everyone agrees that the US needs tax reform. The Tax Foundation’s last survey of tax competitiveness ranked the US a dismal 31st out of the 35 Organisation for Economic   and Development (OECD) member countries it measures. (If you really want simple taxes, move to Estonia or New Zealand). While everyone in Congress would like to see that score improve, no one agrees how.  Trump’s plan is to cut taxes on   Americans, reduce business taxes and simplify the tax code. Three tax bands will replace the current seven, with the threshold for paying tax rising and the top rate falling.  Tax cuts that add to the national debt  —   that are not “revenue neutral”  —   have to expire after 10 years. Tax reform is more ambitious and Trump must balance the books in order to get it passed. In order to do so he has proposed cutting loopholes for the   and corporations  —   including, perhaps, the “carried interest” loophole used by billionaire hedge funders. A   10% tax on repatriating the $2. 5tn corporations have sitting in cash sitting overseas would pay for some cuts, as would a controversial “border adjustment” tax on imported goods. But even if Trump can get his pluses and minuses to balance out, the plan has to pass Congress. Democrats, hoping for a second major Trump fail, won’t give the president any votes, not least because an analysis of Trump’s plan by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded it would give rich people the biggest tax cuts, with about half of the benefits going to the top 1%. Among Republicans too, tax reform is a knotty issue. The proposed border tax has reportedly managed the unusual feat of uniting Paul Ryan, the House speaker, and Stephen Bannon, Trump’s top strategist. The tax would raise $1tn in revenue over 10 years, paying for other cuts and incentivizing US manufacturing (or so Trump argues) over overseas production. It also contains the word “border” which should appeal to his isolationist base. But treasury secretary Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn are against the tax, as are business leaders who argue it will effectively translate into a tax on consumers as retailers and others pass costs on to buyers. Even for Republicans, tax cuts for the rich paid for by price hikes at Walmart might prove a tough sell as the midterm elections approach. Then there are the special interest groups and their pet politicians who will be fighting to keep their tax breaks while lobbying for new ones they’d like. Rewriting 75, 000 pages of tax code will create a feeding frenzy of opportunity. “Tax cuts are easy, tax reform is hard,” says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan and nonprofit organization that studies the impact of fiscal policy. Even with the national debt now marching its way to $20tn (a credit card debt of more than $61, 000 for every US citizen) MacGuineas said she saw little sign that politicians were making the tough choices needed to pass true tax reform. “We are in a period of giveaways and politicians are reluctant to talk about hard choices,” she said. Where X equals the Affordable Care Act, the answer is everything. Politically, Trump’s failure to make good on his promise to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy makes passing any new and major legislation both more important and more difficult.  The rightwing Freedom Caucus played chicken with Trump’s health plans and Trump was the first to blink. His threats of retaliation look about as convincing as those of an overweight school bully who finds his “victim” has a blackbelt in  . The Freedom Caucus now knows it can hold out for the tax policies it likes and will likely derail any plan that appeases the moderates. Financially, the failure to repeal Obamacare also gives Trump a tax headache. Trumpcare (aka the American Health Care Act) could have cost 24 million Americans their health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while handing $144bn in tax cuts over the next decade to those with incomes of $1m or more by axing new taxes created under Obamacare, according to the   Joint Committee on Taxation. It would also have shaved $337bn off the federal budget over the next decade.  If Trump’s tax plans are to remain revenue neutral, and they will have to placate the Republican’s deficit hawks, Trump will have to find other ways to make up that saving. He will also be under pressure to shoehorn those tax breaks back in to the tax reform package. He has pledged to go back for a second run at healthcare but to do so while tackling tax reform would risk creating a tsunami of wonk that could drown an administration that so far has shown little patience for the details. The net result of this   ? The grand plan will collapse and Republicans will eventually pass a   tax cut for the rich, said Cato’s Tanner.  “They are not going to just come out and say they want tax cuts for the rich,” he said. “Tax reform sounds so much more noble. ”  But in the end?  “I don’t think they really care about paying for those tax cuts. ”",-0.5
"Pakistan Shrine Bombing Kills Scores in Worst Attack in Months - The New York Times. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   A suicide bomber turned a spiritual dance celebration at a revered religious shrine into a slaughterhouse on Thursday, killing at least 70 people and wounding more than 250 in the worst act of terrorism to hit Pakistan in months. At least 50 of the wounded were critically hurt in the explosion at the Sufi shrine in a remote part of southern Pakistan, officials said. Many of the victims were women. The Islamic State, the extreme Sunni militant organization based in Syria and Iraq, announced that its branch in the region had carried out the attack. The Islamic State, which regards members of other Muslim groups as nonbelievers deserving death, also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in southwestern Pakistan in November. Sufism, popular in Pakistan, is regarded as a relatively tolerant branch of Islam. The shrine assault on Thursday was by far the worst in a wave of militant attacks that have shaken Pakistan this week, most claimed by the Taliban. The attacks were the catalyst for a decision on Thursday by the armed forces to close the border with Afghanistan, where Pakistani officials claim that many such attacks are coordinated and plotted. A spokesman for the armed forces, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, announced on Twitter that the border closing was effective immediately. While Pakistani officials have voiced skepticism about the presence of the Islamic State in the country, they have acknowledged that some local militant groups have expressed support for it. The attacks have underscored the challenges faced by the civil and military leadership to counter extremist violence. On Wednesday, seven people were killed in northwestern Pakistan in two suicide bombings, one targeting judges in Peshawar, the provincial capital of the northwestern   Province. On Monday, at least 13 people were killed in Lahore, in the east, when militants targeted a protest. The bombing Thursday evening targeted the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a popular Sufi saint, in Sehwan, a city in Jamshoro district of the southern Sindh Province. A large number of people had been performing a spiritual, devotional dance when the bomber struck in the courtyard, officials said, turning a place of spiritual reverie into a spectacle of blood and body parts. The remoteness of the region added to the difficulties faced by the survivors and emergency responders. The nearest big city was about 90 miles away. Khadim Hussain Rind, a senior provincial police officer, said that more than two dozen police officials had been deputized for security at the event and that   cameras had been installed for surveillance of the shrine. “However, it is very difficult to stop a suicide bomber in a big crowd,” Mr. Rind told the local news media. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the bombing as an assault on a “progressive inclusive future of Pakistan. ” Sufi shrines and mosques have been targeted in the past by Taliban militants, who view Sufi Islam as contrary to their beliefs. “The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims,” the prime minister said in the statement. “But we can’t let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity and universal humanity. ” The sudden spike in terrorist violence has shocked and surprised the country. “Pakistan is under attack. The terrorists are creating a climate of fear, intimidation and uncertainty. No institution and no aspect of society is seemingly secure,” Syeda Sughra Imam, a former senator, said in an interview. “Sehwan is synonymous with Pakistan’s Sufi culture and tradition, which has been dealt a devastating blow today. ” The Pakistani military had proudly claimed last year, under the leadership of the then army chief, that the military operations in the tribal regions, especially the one in North Waziristan, and intelligence operations in different cities had largely defeated the militant groups that had carried out many attacks. But the violence has cast doubt on the military’s claims. Imran Khan, the prominent opposition politician, blamed the federal government for what he called its failure to follow through after the military’s offensives against militants. “We need a coherent national security policy,” Mr. Khan said in an interview. “I do think complacency has set in,” Mr. Khan said.",-1.0

"Meet The Woman Who’s Been Pearl Jam’s Sound Engineer For 24 Years. Lots of people have jobs where they make their boss look good. But for over two decades, Karrie Keyes has been making sure her bosses sound good. Keyes is a sound engineer, and her bosses just happen to be Pearl Jam. ”Half our fans, they know who I am because they see me come out on stage,” Keyes says. ”The ’microphone girl,’ because I’m checking the mics.” Keyes (whose last name rhymes with ”eyes”) is Pearl Jam’s monitor engineer, which means she doesn’t deal with the sound the audience hears. Rather, she mixes the sound the individual band members hear, through earbuds and speakers, while they’re playing live. ”Sometimes it’s easy and everybody wants to hear the same thing,” she says. ”And sometimes it’s really difficult, because none of them want to hear the same thing.” From offstage, Keyes communicates with the band, especially lead singer Eddie Vedder, mostly using hand signals. The conditions for her work are unpredictable: Everything from weather and humidity to crowd size and   microphones can change what the musicians are getting in their ears. Over time, she’s redesigned her monitor system specifically to suit the band’s needs. Keyes has been with Pearl Jam for 24 years. Her career dates back to when, as a   teenager at a Black Flag show, she met a sound engineer who offered her a job. ”When I started, it was loading trucks: putting all the equipment back in the trucks, then taking it out of the truck,” Keyes says. She learned to survive on $50 a week, taking any work she could: punk shows, mariachi gigs, gospel festivals. Not every show was great, and as one of few female engineers, she ran into sexism frequently  —   but she says travel and variety made up for the drawbacks. ”You were gonna go someplace else the next day, so it didn’t matter,” she says. ”That was the selling point: Every day was new and every day had the potential of being an amazing day.” By the early 90s when Pearl Jam exploded, Keyes was on the road a lot. Then, she had twin daughters. While she was touring, their dad, aunts and sometimes a nanny took care of them. It was challenging. ”It took me probably till they were three or four to actually come to terms with, ’You know what, I’m actually a better mother if I’m doing what I love doing.’ So that when I’m here, I’m completely here.” George Webb, Pearl Jam’s equipment manager and bass guitar technician, witnessed that transition and says he remains impressed. ”That’s some serious bravery: doing this job, touring all the time and having two kids,” he says. ”I remember, you know, when she was pregnant —  pregnant on tour. Having babies and raising them and trying to tour at the same time just wasn’t an easy thing.” It’s rare for sound engineers to stay with a band as long as Keyes has  —   and it’s still rare for sound engineers to be women. That’s why a few years ago, Keyes   SoundGirls, a group that supports and mentors women in professional audio. This summer, SoundGirls held camps to teach young women live sound. ”Everyone’s had a mentor, a teacher, a guide,” Keyes says. ”The crew and the band has earned being here. And we’re going to go out and put on a really good show.” The concert audio in this story, recorded at Fenway Park in Boston on Aug. 7, 2016, was provided courtesy of Greg Nelson, John Burton and Pearl Jam.",-0.5
"Trump’s Men In Moscow: Trump Disciples Suddenly Showing Up In Russia. Donald Trump hasn’t been inaugurated yet, but members of his campaign entourage are already riding the  ’s coattails all the way to Moscow. On Monday, Jack Kingston, a former Trump surrogate, briefed American businesspeople in Russia on what they might expect from the incoming administration. Lifting Western sanctions that were imposed on Russia because of its armed intervention in Ukraine has become the top priority not only for the Kremlin but for foreign companies working in Moscow. During the campaign, Trump indicated he would reconsider those sanctions and suggested he would get along fine with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ”Trump can look at sanctions. They’ve been in place long enough,” Kingston told NPR in Moscow. ”Has the desired result been reached? He doesn’t have to abide by the Obama foreign policy. That gives him a fresh start.” Kingston said he had mostly met with businesspeople in Moscow and that there had been no meetings with Russian government officials or U. S. diplomats. Now was the time, he said, for business to step up and play a role in ”soft diplomacy.” Although Kingston traveled as a private individual, the former Georgia congressman’s bio on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia didn’t hide his connections to the stars of Team Trump such as Vice   Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. ”I was an active soldier in the foxhole, but not a general deploying troops,” Kingston said about his role in the Trump campaign. By chance, Kingston’s Moscow trip coincided with the visit of another Trump disciple, Carter Page, who once claimed to advise the Republican candidate on energy and Russia policy. The Trump campaign later distanced itself from Page after he came under scrutiny for his ties to Russia. On Monday, Page held a news conference at the headquarters of Sputnik, a Russian   news agency, where he complained about the proliferation of fake news. Page lamented the ”Cold War mindset” in the U. S. and sang the praises of Rex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO who expanded his company’s footprint in Russia and whom Trump now wants to be his secretary of state. Tillerson’s last public appearance in Russia was in June during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. When he was asked about the future of sanctions, Tillerson laughed and said only a U. S. government official could answer that question. The next time he comes to Russia, Tillerson may not be able to dodge that question quite so easily.",-0.5

They come in many varieties, with lovely names like Charlotte, Anaïs, Cléry, Gariguette or the intriguing Mara des bois (Mara of the woods). I have a soft spot for the Gariguette, a longish berry that is as fragrant as wild strawberries. I admit I like it because it was my older brother’s favorite. My brother Bertrand died five years ago this month, at the height of strawberry season. Now, every time I rinse strawberries before eating them, I hear his voice telling me, ”Use lukewarm water. It’ll clean them better.” Bertrand was an artist, a craftsman, a dreamer and a foodie, the kind who would walk deep into Paris’ Chinatown to get the right fish and the right fruit, all at bargain prices. He was a     cook. He would toil away in the kitchen for hours, meticulously creating wholesome meals for friends and family waiting impatiently with growling stomachs. Meat would be sliced just so  —   deboned, deveined and defatted vegetables would be coated with crushed garlic, herbs, coriander or thyme and fruit salads would be dressed with some flavor he had concocted. He was the master of our family’s feasts. In Bertrand’s kitchen, strawberries would be halved lengthwise and macerated in sugar and orange blossom water, a simple and delicate dessert everyone in my family remembers fondly. I prepare them the same way, too. In the spring of 2012, I flew from Boston, where I lived then, to visit Bertrand in Paris. At the age of 59, he was losing his battle with stomach cancer. He knew he was dying. He told me so, calmly. But at a time when he could no longer ingest any solid food, he still found the strength and willpower to make chicken stew with vegetables for me and for his     son, Arthur. He carved ripe mangoes and tossed sliced strawberries in his special sweet dressing. He watched me eat his meal  —   as if my enjoyment could feed him vicariously.  During his last days, in a Paris hospital, I asked him what he’d like me to bring him. He was being kept alive by IV fluids. ”Nothing,” he said, ”though I wouldn’t mind tasting a couple of Gariguettes.” It felt good that he had requested something to taste, especially his beloved strawberries. It was as if he had hope, and I could have some, too. I returned the next day with a box of the fruit, but Bertrand was in a fog by then  —   mentally absent and in a lot of pain. He thanked me for the strawberries and said he would try them later, but he never did. He died later that evening. Arthur and close relatives came to the hospital. At dawn, after an impromptu wake, my sister Bénédicte and I left the hospital with some of Bertrand’s things the nursing staff had handed to us. In the taxi taking me home, I found the box of Gariguettes in a bag. They were bruised, but I ate them as tears ran down my cheeks. Bertrand’s funeral a few days later mirrored his personality: eccentric, funny, sad and completely irreverent. It also reflected his love for cooking. At one point in the ceremony, nieces and nephews read out loud  —   through giggles and tears  —   his signature recipes, including his roast leg of lamb, his chicken breasts grilled in butter sauce with macaroni, and his strawberry dessert. The tribute continued at a nearby theater lounge where our family and a large gathering of friends shared stories about Bertrand over good wines, bread and rillettes (a charcuterie spread, previously defatted of course) and large bowls of Gariguettes. Bertrand would have approved. To me, May will forever be the month of my brother’s passing. It’s also the most vibrant time of spring, when brightly colored flowers and fruit pop up everywhere. And so, I take solace in the fact that each May, the perky Gariguettes return as a vivid celebration of my brother’s endless love for food and life.

"Feds Discover Home Constructed for Sole Purpose of Concealing Mexican Drug Tunnel - Breitbart. Federal officials in California are examining a     drug tunnel. They captured 1, 500 pounds of marijuana and made six arrests this week after law enforcement monitored the construction of a house that drug traffickers had built simply to conceal the tunnel opening. [“This house and tunnel were constructed under the watchful eye of law enforcement,” U. S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement Wednesday. “For the builders, the financiers and the operators of these passageways, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. We will seize your drugs and your tunnel before you even have a chance to use it. ”  According to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement release, the tunnel uncovered in Calexico, California is the first   border tunnel discovered since 2006 and the circumstances represent the first time drug traffickers are known to have purchased a parcel of land and had home constructed on top of it “sole purpose” of hiding the tunnel exit. The drug traffickers allegedly purchased a parcel of land in a residential section of Calexico for $240, 000 last April. The house was built by December for approximately $86, 000. According to law enforcement, the agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) used   wire tapes to monitor the construction project in October and November. “According to the case affidavit, the property owners told the construction contractor to leave a space for a floor safe when pouring a cement foundation for the house. Investigators believe the owners intended to use the hole in the foundation as the tunnel’s exit point. In late December 2015, coconspirators rented a “walk behind saw and concrete blade” from a local business in El Centro, presumably to create the tunnel exit,” ICE said in its release. Law enforcement seized the tunnel Wednesday. Two defendants arrested in connection with the  case  —   a   pair  —   Marcia Manuela   and Eva Duarte De Medina, were arrested in Nogales, Arizona on Tuesday. Another two defendants were arrested in Calexico on Wednesday, Joel Duarte Medina and Manuel Gallegos Jimenez. Two more defendants were arrested in Mexico by Mexican authorities on Wednesday. “Today’s enforcement actions are the culmination of months of tireless investigative work by HSI and its enforcement partners, showing yet again our collective resolve to use all of the resources at our disposal to combat this increasingly dangerous form of   smuggling,” Dave Shaw, special agent in charge for HSI San Diego, said in a statement Wednesday. “I’d emphasize that our investigation in this case is still very much ongoing, but preliminarily we believe the shuttering of this latest smuggling tunnel has dealt a serious blow to yet another narcotics trafficking organization that was determined to succeed at all costs. ”",1.0

"Barack Obama ’deliberately snubbed’ by Chinese in chaotic arrival at G20. China’s leaders have been accused of delivering a calculated diplomatic snub to Barack Obama after the US president was not provided with a staircase to leave his plane during his chaotic arrival in Hangzhou before the start of the G20. Chinese authorities have rolled out the red carpet for leaders including India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the South Korean president, Park   Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, and the British prime minister, Theresa May, who touched down on Sunday morning.  But the leader of the world’s largest economy, who is on his final tour of Asia, was forced to disembark from Air Force One through a   exit in the plane’s belly after no rolling staircase was provided when he landed in the eastern Chinese city on Saturday afternoon. When Obama did find his way on to a red carpet on the tarmac below there were heated altercations between US and Chinese officials, with one Chinese official caught on video shouting: “This is our country! This is our airport!” “The reception that President Obama and his staff got when they arrived here Saturday afternoon was bruising, even by Chinese standards,” the New York Times reported.  Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to China, said he was convinced Obama’s treatment was part of a calculated snub. “These things do not happen by mistake. Not with the Chinese,” Guajardo, who hosted presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón during his time in Beijing, told the Guardian.  “I’ve dealt with the Chinese for six years. I’ve done these visits. I took Xi Jinping to Mexico. I received two Mexican presidents in China. I know exactly how these things get worked out. It’s down to the last detail in everything. It’s not a mistake. It’s not. ” Guajardo added: “It’s a snub. It’s a way of saying: ‘You know, you’re not that special to us.’ It’s part of the new Chinese arrogance. It’s part of stirring up Chinese nationalism. It’s part of saying: ‘China stands up to the superpower.’ It’s part of saying: ‘And by the way, you’re just someone else to us.’ It works very well with the local audience. “Why [did it happen]?” the former diplomat, who was ambassador from 2007 until 2013, added. “I guess it is part of Xi Jinping playing the nationalist card. That’s my guess. ” Bill Bishop, a China expert whose Sinocism newsletter tracks the country’s political scene, agreed that Obama’s welcome looked suspiciously like a deliberate slight intended “to make the Americans look diminished and weak”. “It sure looks like a   snub,” Bishop said. “This clearly plays very much into the [idea]: ‘Look, we can make the American president go out of the ass of the plane. ’”  Bishop added: “We’ve no proof. It could clearly just be a   but it would be a stunningly large   given how well these people plan for all these events and especially for something like the G20. The idea that they have been preparing for well over a year for the G20 but suddenly there be a malfunction with the ramp just for one president   …     that really strains credulity. ” A Chinese foreign ministry official involved in the visit denied it had been a snub, telling the South China Morning Post the US delegation had declined to use the usual rolling   staircase.  “It would do China no good in treating Obama rudely,” the official, who declined to be named, was quoted as saying.  “China provides a rolling staircase for every arriving state leader, but the US side complained that the driver doesn’t speak English and can’t understand security instructions from the United States so China proposed that we could assign a translator to sit beside the driver, but the US side turned down the proposal and insisted that they didn’t need the staircase provided by the airport,” the official added. The US president offered a diplomatic reply when asked to comment on the airport “kerfuffle” on Sunday during a joint press conference with Theresa May. “I wouldn’t   the significance of it because, as I said, this is not the first time that these things happen and it doesn’t just happen here. It happens in a lot of places including, by the way, sometimes our allies,” Obama said, adding that “none of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship”. Obama suggested his Chinese hosts might have found the size of the US delegation “a little overwhelming”.  “We’ve got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars and a lot of guys. If you are a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much. ”  Susan Rice, the US national security adviser, admitted she had been surprised by the handling of the president’s arrival. “They did things that weren’t anticipated,” she told reporters.  The New York Times said Rice had appeared “baffled and annoyed” that the president had been forced to leave Air Force One through a door normally reserved for   trips to places such as Afghanistan.  In the   to the final meeting between Obama and Xi, experts had predicted the pair would seek to part ways on a positive note with the announcement that the world’s two largest polluters would ratify the Paris climate agreement.  However, Obama’s unconventional welcome  —   and a series of subsequent skirmishes and quarrels between Chinese and US officials and journalists  —   were a reminder of the underlying tensions.  The Washington Post said Obama’s bumpy landing in China was “a fitting reflection of how the relationship between these two world powers has become frayed and fraught with frustration”.  “I think this time   …     maybe the seams were showing a little more than usual in terms of some of the negotiations and jostling that takes place behind the scenes,” Obama admitted on Sunday.  Official statements issued by both sides on Saturday, as the pair held more than four hours of bilateral meetings, hinted at some of the disagreements between the world’s two largest economies.  According to a White House statement, Obama told Xi of “America’s unwavering support for upholding human rights”.  “China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues,” Xi told Obama in response, according to Xinhua, Beijing’s official news wire.  In an interview with CNN, Obama warned Beijing against   in the South China Sea. Xi told Obama his country would “unswervingly safeguard” its claims in the region.  Bishop said: “Other than in climate, in most areas of the   relationship there is increasing amounts of friction and some actually increasingly quite hot friction around the South China Sea and some of these military [interactions] in the region. ” “The US is looking a little weak and a little tired and I think [Beijing is] happy to put anybody in their place when they can. I think they see the opportunity to make Obama look weak,” he added.  Both Bishop and Guajardo said the reported confrontations between Chinese and US officials and journalists following Obama’s arrival in Hangzhou were par for the course in China. “That is just typical China. I remember when my president came, one of the Mexican press corps came out of it with stitches,” Guajardo recalled. But Obama’s unceremonious arrival was unusual and surely deliberate, the former Mexican ambassador added. “Just as the Chinese are about giving face they are also about not giving it and letting you know that they are not giving it to you   …     They don’t overlook these things by mistake. It’s not who they are. It’s not the way they do these things,” he said. ",-0.5
"Christian Refugees Forced to Participate in Islamic Prayers. Christian   in Germany are regularly bullied, beaten and forced to participate in Muslim prayer services, according to a report released this week. [There are currently more than one million migrants and refugees living in Germany, the vast majority of whom are Muslims. The new report, titled “Religiously motivated attacks on Christian refugees in Germany” was prepared by the humanitarian relief organization Open Doors, and documents a sharp increase in aggression and violence towards Christians in the refugee centers.  Particularly under attack are Christian converts from Islam, who are considered apostates by the Muslim migrants. Thomas Muller, an Open Doors persecution analyst, said that “Christian refugees —  especially those who are converts to the Christian faith —  live in fear of persecution from Muslim refugees who make up the majority of residents in the refugee hostels set up throughout Europe. ” The study found that fully half of the 231 Christian migrants interviewed over the last two months said they had been “bullied” by Muslims in refugee camps or reception centers, and also claimed that Muslim migrants were forcing Christians to take part in Islamic prayers. In Berlin, a Protestant minister claimed that Christian refugees had been threatened after they refused to take part in Islamic prayers with other migrants, mainly from Afghanistan and Iran. As a result of their findings, Open Doors is appealing to German authorities to keep   in separate centers to ensure their safety. The Christian migrants interviewed said that they had suffered abuse both from fellow refugees and from hostel security staff, and some 75% stated that this had happened repeatedly. Many Christian refugees also revealed that they are frightened of reporting incidents lest they face more problems as a result, including violence against family members still living in Muslim countries. Some 80% of the refugees surveyed said there was a real need for separate accommodations for Christians and Muslims. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @   <!

"Supreme Court Orders New Trial For Black Death Row Inmate Convicted By All-White Jury. The U. S. Supreme Court ruled today that a black Georgia man convicted of murder by an   jury should have a new trial because the prosecution deliberately excluded   from the jury based on their race. The court’s decision reversed as ”clearly erroneous” an earlier ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court, which had said the defendant had not proved racial discrimination in the selection of his jury. It has been nearly 30 years since the U. S. Supreme Court set new rules to counter race discrimination in the seating of juries. But in some jurisdictions, the propensity to bar nonwhite jurors persisted, even in capital cases such as the one against Timothy Foster, a black man accused of killing an elderly white woman. The case was tried in 1987, one year after the Supreme Court had said lawyers could not use their right to ”peremptory strikes” (dismissals without cause) to remove jurors if those peremptory strikes showed a racial pattern. All of the prospective jurors who were black were kept off the jury, compared with only 16 percent of the white prospective jurors. Foster was sentenced to die. He has been on death row ever since, as a series of appeals have made their way through the state and federal court systems. On Monday, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled there was ample evidence that the juror strikes in Foster’s trial not only resulted in an   jury, but also showed clear evidence of being racially motivated  —   even though other reasons were cited at the time. Those purported reasons included observations about how individual black prospective jurors had behaved in court, or how their religious affiliation might affect their willingness to impose the death penalty. Those alternative explanations for the strikes had been accepted by appeals courts since the trial, even after an attorney for Foster obtained notes from the prosecution team in 2006 (using Georgia’s Open Records Act). In those notes, all blacks in the pool of prospective jurors had their names highlighted in green and marked with the letter ”B.” ”[T]he focus on race in the prosecution’s file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the ruling he wrote for the court majority of   with Justice Clarence Thomas the lone dissenter. The court has only eight justices at present because the late Antonin Scalia’s seat remains vacant pending consideration of a successor by the U. S. Senate.",-0.5
"Clinton campaign digging for ways to trip up Trump at debate. Their quest for damaging information on the billionaire businessman even includes talking to Trump’s “The Art of the Deal”   Tony Schwartz.  The New York Times first reported on the discussions Tuesday. Clinton strategists are hoping the 18 months Schwartz shadowed Trump at his office    including weekends with him at his Manhattan pad and travel with Trump on    trips    will yield some anecdotal ammo Clinton could use at the debate. Whether Schwartz has any juicy details that could be used to throw Trump off his game at the candidates’ first faceoff    set for Sept. 26 in Hempstead, N. Y.    is unknown.  To be sure, there is no love lost between Schwartz and Trump. In an interview with The New Yorker, Schwartz once said he felt like he had “put lipstick on a pig” with their ”Art of the Deal” book and added that he has a “deep sense of remorse” that he “contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is. ” If Schwartz’s info doesn’t help, a Democratic source told Fox News the Clinton campaign still has at least 25 researchers digging into four decades of Trump’s background and mining for information that can be used against him.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → They’re also seeking advice from psychology experts, searching for ways to bait him into making blunders on stage. The Democratic source noted the Clinton campaign recognizes that during the Republican primaries, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s snarky reference to the size of Trump’s hands at a Virginia rally seemed to throw Trump off balance.  Trump addressed the comment at the next debate in Detroit, in an awkward moment.  “Nobody has ever hit my hands, I’ve never heard of this before. Look at those hands, are they small hands?” Trump asked the audience. “And he referred to my hands, ‘if they’re small something else must be small.’ I guarantee you there’s no problem, I guarantee it. ”  Senior Clinton aides, meanwhile, are predicting that Trump will ”go for broke at the debates” and cast him as a ”formidable adversary.”  But as Clinton’s crew continues to look for ways to stump Trump, the Republican nominee    who used the debates to help clear away the crowded GOP field during the primaries    says he isn’t going to spend too much time rehearsing for the big day. “I believe you can prep too much for those things,” Trump told the Times. “It can be dangerous. You can sound scripted or phony  —   like you’re trying to be someone you’re not. ” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway argued Sunday that Trump is indeed an “unconventional candidate” but will arrive at the debates prepared. “He is the unpredictable X factor,” Conway told “Fox News Sunday. ” “Donald Trump, who’s been taking his case directly to the voters, is the one that you will see on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And I think they’re nervous over in Clinton camp. ” Fox News’ Mike Emanuel and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.    ",1.0
"Helping Ex-Inmates Stay Out Of The ER Brings Multiple Benefits. The Washington, D. C. jail has big metal doors that slam shut. It looks and feels like a jail. But down a hall in the medical wing, past an inmate muttering about suicide, there’s a room that looks like an ordinary doctor’s office. ”OK, deep breaths in and out for me,” Dr. Reggie Egins says to his patient, Sean Horn, an inmate in his 40s. They talk about how his weight has changed in his six weeks in jail, how his medications are working out and whether he’s noticed anything different about his vision. Egins schedules an ophthalmology appointment for Horn. Horn says before he arrived here, things were not looking good. ”I looked real bad. I was homeless, for one, and not taking my medicine,” says Horn, who has depression, high blood pressure and gout, among other things. When he was out on the streets, Horn says, it was hard for him to get his medications or to see a doctor. So he just didn’t. He got sicker and sicker. ”I had two heart attacks and my gout flared up a whole lot of times when I was out there,” he says. Horn is no outlier. People with a history of incarceration are typically much sicker than the general population, especially returning inmates like Horn. Studies done primarily in Ohio and Texas have found that more than 8 in 10 returning prisoners have a chronic medical condition, from addiction to asthma. Egins says a lot of it has gone untreated, for a range of reasons  —   because the health care system is tough to navigate, because they’re homeless and don’t have insurance, or because they don’t trust doctors. ”The first thing is that they usually have no permanent address, which means that they cannot apply for health insurance   there’s nowhere to receive those documents if they do,” says Egins, a family doctor who does correctional health care, splitting each week between serving patients at the D. C. jail and at Unity Health Care, a network of community health centers. Now, being in jail is not healthy. But for a lot of people, the best health care they’ll receive is what they get behind bars. About 40 percent of inmates are newly diagnosed with a chronic medical condition while incarcerated. Outside, many only interact with doctors when they’re in the emergency room. And when they are released, as millions are each year, they enter a risky time, says Dr. Emily Wang, a primary care doctor with the Yale University School of Medicine. ”Man, if there is any one single thing in the literature that is compelling, it’s that there’s a significantly higher risk of dying in the first two weeks following release from a correctional facility,” she says. Wang says the primary causes of death after incarceration include overdose, heart disease, suicide and cancer  —   often treatable things, if you catch them early enough. It’s not just a matter of getting insurance. ”Insurance is necessary, but it’s not sufficient,” says Wang. ”Our patients will often come with insurance, but they don’t know the first thing about how to use the health care system to their benefit.” Behind bars, patients get three meals a day and line up to get their daily medications handed to them by a nurse. ”When they come home from prison, they have to learn to use the pharmacy, learn to get a refill, learn to make their appointments . .. on top of trying to get housing, get employed, figure out where to get food for the day,” she says. So many former inmates put off getting medical care until they wind up in the emergency room, with conditions that have become a lot worse than they could’ve been. That means they are also more expensive to treat, costs that are often picked up by hospitals and taxpayers. Wang and her colleagues are trying to make it easier for   to manage their health care so they don’t end up in the ER. They work at the Transitions Clinic Network, which now has 14 sites across the U. S. and in Puerto Rico. They’re funded by private donations and by grants like one from the Center for Medicare  Medicaid Innovation. Their patients qualify for Medicaid based on income, and the clinics are reimbursed by Medicaid. The difference is that they offer more services than Medicaid typically does  —   like helping patients find a halfway house they can afford. Joe McFadden has experienced how much of a difference those extra services can make. McFadden spent 40 days in solitary confinement before being released two weeks later.  ”You’re just locked up like an animal. That’s not good or healthy at all,” says McFadden, who is in his 40s and was homeless and living on the streets of New Haven, Conn. when I spoke with him. ”It’s not easy, coming home from being incarcerated to a world where you’re being discriminated against,” he says. Shortly after release, McFadden ended up in the emergency room with a ballooning leg. It was a blood clot. ”I thought I had pulled a muscle. It took me like a week to go in because I didn’t know the symptoms of having blood clots,” he says. He’d rarely been to the doctor before that, but now he comes in for regular visits at the Transitions clinic in New Haven. The staff there helped him find a substance abuse program, and a place where he could visit his two kids. ”Our rationale for this program is by organizing primary care in this manner, we improve public health,” Wang says. ”Our patients are sicker than the general population, so by caring for them, fewer communicable diseases are transmitted, substance use is treated, etc.” She adds: ”Moreover, it makes good business sense for the health system.” In a randomized control trial looking at 200 recently released prisoners in San Francisco, Wang and her colleagues showed that bringing that population to see doctors significantly reduced emergency room visits and hospitalizations. That lessens the strain on emergency departments, and the cost burden that emergency treatment puts on the health care system. Wang works at the New Haven clinic, which gets additional funding from the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven, the   Haven Hospital and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The staff starts off the morning by running through a list of the patients coming in. One patient is worried about relapsing on a drug addiction and wants to talk about options for staying clean. Another patient with an infection in his leg has finally gone to see orthopedics. ”That was a huge accomplishment. Getting him to an appointment is a feat,” says Dr. Lisa Puglisi, one of the physicians at Transitions. The patient came to his appointment because of Jerry Smart. As a community health worker with Transitions, Smart is the clinic’s secret weapon, because patients might not trust doctors, but they do trust him. ”This population, you know, they’ve been dealing with probation, parole, dealing with correctional officers. So they don’t trust people,” says Smart. Like all Transition’s community health workers, Smart knows what it’s like to be an  . It has been 30 years since he did time, but he remembers feeling judged by doctors and thinking they didn’t care about his well being. ”A lot of these guys feel the same way. But when they meet me, I just let them know we have a great team. The physicians care about you, they care about your needs,” says Smart. ”So once they buy into me, then they buy into the whole thing.” No one wants to be sick, he says, but sometimes the whole health care system can be intimidating. He’ll go with patients to their appointments, check in with some of them regularly on the phone, and he’ll even take frantic calls at 2 a. m. about whether they should go to the emergency room or not. Mark Baskerville, who lives in New Haven, is one of the clinic’s success stories. He’s in his   and he has been in and out of prison four times. On the bus coming home, he says, ”First it’s anxieties that pick up: ’Man, am I going to do all right?’ Things are in your hands and you’re in control of it now.” Health problems are easy to push aside, he says. Baskerville has been living with diabetes for about 20 years, about 12 of which he spent in the correctional system. He says he had five diabetic comas while he was an inmate. But since   the community, he has come for regular visits at the clinic and says he’s doing better. ”It was easy. I know what I got to do to take care of my diabetes. You got to work with your doctor,” says Baskerville. If you don’t, he says, you’ll never be able to enjoy your freedom.",-0.5
"Political divide widens between rural, urban voters, analysts say.   There’s always been a political divide between city and country dwellers, but experts say this election year the gap is wider than ever before. ”It’s expedited quite significantly over the past decade or so,” said Ross C. Devol, chief research officer for the independent economic think tank The Milken Institute. ”And the recession probably edged it on even further.” During America’s recovery from the recession of 2008, many metropolitan areas around the country have seen significant job growth, resulting in booming populations that further fuel their economies. DeVol said communities in rural America have not been brought along for the ride, adding ”We’ve actually seen a decline in population between 2010 and 2015 in rural America.” Colorado was the second fastest growing state in the country from 2010 to 2015. But that growth has been mostly concentrated in the urban corridor running north and south in the middle of the state. Other than Colorado Springs, with its numerous military facilities, most of the cities in this urban strip trend Democratic.  Ellen Dumm is a public relations strategist living in Denver who feels America has gotten better during the last administration. ”We were in the midst of the worst economic recession I’d ever experienced in my lifetime, so I think definitely in the last eight years, things have improved,” she said. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → A lifelong Democrat, Dumm plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. Most of the less populous eastern and western parts of the state trend Republican. Eric Van Dyk is a farmer and rancher in Rocky Ford, a small town in Otero County in the southeastern part of Colorado.  Though not a huge fan of Donald Trump, he said he will vote for him, explaining, ”Well I think the Republican Party is in the best interest of agriculture and people that are more rural living. They’re more concerned about keeping our way of life.” Van Dyk works a second job, teaching at Rocky Ford High School, but has no plans to leave the town he loves. ”Had a lot of opportunities to do other things and go other places and ultimately wanted to raise my kids here,” he said. “The community really comes together and supports one another.” Along with Colorado, the key battleground states of Virginia and North Carolina are seeing the greatest increase in the gap between urban and rural areas in terms of population growth and economics, according to a report by the Economic Innovation Group. Devol said the growing economic divide has much to do with increasing globalization ”because the U. S. is able to compete most effectively in high value added services, so called knowledge economy jobs. We’re talking about software engineers, biotechnology and those are growing in urban areas.”  As urban America grows and rural America shrinks, the relative political clout of each follows suit. ”Really, it’s hard to say what needs are being addressed,” said Otero County Commissioner Kevin Karney. ”It’s easier to say what needs aren’t being addressed.”   With Otero County’s population just around 20, 000, Karney said getting the attention of lawmakers is a   battle.  ”Individually, Otero County does not have a strong voice. We have to form alliances with other counties and go as a group in order to have a voice at the state capitol and especially at the national level,” he added. The frustration was palpable as Karney talked about billion dollar highway improvement projects in the Denver area. ”You know our road conditions out here in rural Colorado continue to deteriorate, our infrastructure on bridges and surface conditions,” he said. According to DeVol, as the gap between city and country continues to grow, ”to some extent we’re losing the ability to communicate effectively about the various problems that we’re facing.”  Which in turn only adds fuel to the angry political discourse being heard in some quarters this year.  ”It is coming from both sides,” Dumm said. ”And I think it’s the more extreme portions of the divide, whether you’re progressive or conservative.” The   divide will be with us for some time to come, according to DeVol. ”I think as we’ve left the recessionary period and moved through the expansion it might not continue at the same pace, but long term there’s no indication that it’s going to reverse.” Fox News’ Alicia Acuna and Lloyd Gottschalk contributed to this report.

"What A Difference A Drug Makes In The Fight Against River Blindness. One of the problems with river blindness is that it doesn’t kill you. It’s a nasty disease that causes agonizing itching, disfigured skin and, in the worst cases, blindness. River blindness is a parasitic infection transmitted by black flies that breed in rapidly flowing bodies of water. The worms burrow under your skin and eventually wiggle across your pupils, destroying your vision. But because the disease usually isn’t fatal, health officials in   tropical countries have slotted it lower on their   lists than malaria, TB, cholera, AIDS and other   diseases. Indeed, the World Health Organization categorizes river blindness, also known as onchocerciasis, as a ”neglected tropical disease.” But over the past three decades, much of the world has made steady progress against the debilitating condition. And much of the credit for that progress is linked to ministries of health introducing the drug ivermectin. Mass distributions of ivermectin tablets have sent onchocerciasis rates plummeting. The village of Beposo 2 in central Ghana is one of those places. Local chief Bondi Sanbark says his village used to be full of blind men being led around by young boys. But that started changing after Ghana changed its strategy in the battle against the disease in the late 1980s. Up to that point, Ghana had been using insecticides to try to kill the black flies that carry the river blindness parasite. The new strategy goes after the parasites inside people. The government treats entire villages, every year, with a drug called ivermectin that kills the offspring of the parasites, which cause the blindness and also can infect others. The mass ivermectin campaigns are now treating roughly 4 million Ghanaians a year, or more than 15 percent of the population. And the strategy is paying off. No one has gone blind in Beposo 2 for years, says Sanbark. Beposo 2 was founded around the time of Ghana’s independence from Britain in 1957. The town is a  ’s drive from the Pru River, where the black flies that carry the river blindness parasite swarm. Its founders wanted to get away from the river and from onchocerciasis. But they couldn’t escape the reach of the flies. The situation was better here away from the river, but people got sick with what they refer to as ”oncho.” Since the introduction of ivermectin, onchocerciasis infections still occur in Beposo 2, but now they’re much milder than in the past. The disease has been sharply curtailed in many parts of Africa and is on the verge of elimination from the Americas. But even ivermectin isn’t perfect. Ivermectin doesn’t actually kill the roundworm parasites that cause onchocerciasis. The drug is only able to kill the offspring of the parasites, the baby larvae. It’s the spreading of hundreds of thousands of these immature worms through a person’s body that causes the disease. Unfortunately, the parasite can live in a person’s body for up to 15 years. So to suppress the spread of the parasites, entire villages have to be treated with ivermectin year after year in logistically complicated campaigns. The distribution campaigns require armies of volunteers. ”This job is soooo difficult,” says Albert Tamanja Bidim, the drug distribution volunteer in Beposo 2. Once a year he has to track down every resident of the village and give them the proper number of ivermectin tablets. He carries a long stick, a white bottle of pills and a handwritten ledger with all the villagers’ names in it. The markings on the stick indicate how many pills a person should get. Bidim holds it up next to a boy to determine what dosage to give him. Kids under 90 centimeters, roughly 3 feet tall, and pregnant women don’t get any out of safety concerns. The dose varies from one to four tablets, washed down at once, for taller kids and adults. Bidim doesn’t get paid for this work but takes the job very seriously. ”If the person is not here, and I know how many tablets the person will take, I will keep it for him,” Bidim says. ”Sometimes, maybe if he has traveled or went to the farm, I’ll keep the tablets until he gets back.” This process of volunteers pounding on doors and passing out ivermectin happens all across Ghana in villages prone to river blindness. ”We have about 5 million Ghanaians at risk of onchocerciasis,” says Dr.   Biritwum, who heads the neglected tropical disease program in the Ghana Ministry of Health. He says the annual distribution campaigns are a major undertaking. ”We go in with millions of tablets, every year, to treat every community.” Many of the villages hardest hit by river blindness are in remote, inaccessible parts. ”It takes a lot of work, a lot of resources,” Biritwum says. Onchocerciasis is less neglected than some other neglected tropical diseases in that a major pharmaceutical company has made it its cause celebre. For decades, Merck has made an unlimited amount of ivermectin available for free under the brand name Mectizan. International aid groups including the World Bank, Sightsavers and the Carter Center have helped fund the distributions. Ghana is seeing the results. Some villages have gone from having 70 to 80 percent of adults testing positive for onchocerciasis 25 years ago to just 2 to 3 percent today. Ghana is now talking about trying to wipe out the disease by 2020. Biritwum at the ministry of health says before the arrival of ivermectin, that never would have been possible. Ivermectin’s incredible impact on river blindness and other roundworm infections also caught the eye of the Nobel committee. The 2015 prize for medicine went to William Campbell of the U. S. and Satoshi Omura from Japan for discovering the drug (a third honoree did work on malaria). The Nobel committee said, ”This year’s Nobel Laureates have developed therapies that have revolutionized the treatment of some of the most devastating parasitic diseases.” And the impact of their work can be clearly seen in villages like Beposo 2 in Ghana.

"Libyan Prime Minister Warns of Islamic State Migrant Infiltrators. Libyan Prime Minister Fayez   has warned European leaders that Islamic State militants are infiltrating the large number of migrants pouring into Italy. [The new Prime Minister of Libya Fayez   who was elected earlier this year, is warning European leaders that the fight against Islamic State in his country could have a serious impact on Europe. He claims that currently the terror group is smuggling fighters into the European Union (EU) via ships packed with migrants from Africa.   Mr.   claims that the only way to combat the radical Islamic terror group is for the international community to come together and fight them in Libya, and warned that Islamic State could once again spread unless there is international help, he said in an interview with Italian paper Corriere della Sera. “ISIS is a highly dangerous organisation,” said   adding: “I would not be surprised if it turned out that ISIS men hide on the boats that are on the way to your shores. We need to tackle this problem together and to be aware that there may be terrorists among migrants. ISIS threatens us all the same. ” The Libyan Prime Minister made the case for foreign intervention in the ongoing conflict in Libya calling on help from Italy and the EU saying: “Our Libya needs international help in the battle against ISIS. Italy is traditionally our country’s friend, you can do so much. ” Mr.   told the Italian paper that he chose to speak to them because his father read the paper when he was a child. Though the new Libyan government has managed to stop the advance of Islamic State across the country, much of Libya still remains in the hands of the terrorist organisation and its sympathisers. “ISIS now uses new tactics in difficult urban warfare on the streets of Sirte. They are treacherous, dangerous,” he said and claimed that the group was using civilians as human shields against his government’s attempts to remove them.  While he wants international aid in fighting Islamic State, Mr.   was clear that he did not mean boots on the ground. Speaking of his recent talks with the United States he said: “I only asked for intervention with U. S. air strikes, and that they have to be very surgical and limited in time and geographical regions, increasingly coordinated with us. We do not need foreign troops on the soil of Libya. ” The people trafficking of migrants from Libya to Italy has become the focal point of the migrant crisis after the closure of the Balkan route. Tens of thousands of migrants have so far crossed the sea from Libya to Italy and the Prime Minister claims that he is open to international help to solve the issue.  “Regarding security, we Libyans must get control of our immense southern borders. We do not have the strength to do it. There are thousands of kilometres in the desert. We do not know how to go against international criminal organisations that traffic in human beings. They are powerful and rich. ” “For me personally I am sorry that our coasts, instead of being visited by European tourists, are packed with migrants, and occasionally on the beach there are the corpses thrown from the sea of those who have not made it to land in Italy,” he lamented.

"Clinton’s lead over Trump narrows to less than three points: Reuters/Ipsos poll.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead over Republican rival Donald Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, according to a   opinion poll released on Friday, down from nearly eight points on Monday. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton, to Trump’s 39 percent, according to the July  . 4 online poll of 1, 154 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of five percentage points, down from eight percentage points on Monday, according to the poll.  The reasons behind the shift were unclear.  Clinton had pulled well ahead of Trump on the heels of the Democratic National Convention last week, where she became the first woman to accept the U. S. presidential nomination from a major political party.  Since then, Trump has engaged in a   feud with the family of an American soldier killed in Iraq and squabbled with the Republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign. Trump, in recent days, however, has sought to refocus. On Friday he announced his economic policy advisory team, said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week, and was expected to endorse U. S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U. S. elected Republican, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. An average of polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 6. 8 percentage points on Friday, up from 3. 9 on Aug. 1.  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler) CHICAGO In an   Fourth of July holiday session, the Illinois Senate quickly overrode Governor Bruce Rauner’s veto of fiscal 2018 spending and tax hike bills aimed at ending an unprecedented budget impasse that threatens to push the state’s credit rating to junk.

"Celtics beat Cavaliers with 0.1 seconds left to keep Eastern Conference finals alive. Avery Bradley’s   danced around the rim and dropped in with less than a second left and the Boston Celtics, blown out in the first two games of the Eastern Conference finals and playing without star Isaiah Thomas, stunned the Cleveland Cavaliers   on Sunday night in Game 3 to end the champions’   postseason winning streak. Bradley’s shot from the left wing bounced on the rim four times before going down. It capped a furious comeback by the Celtics, who trailed by 21 in the third quarter before rallying to tighten up a series that appeared to be over. Marcus Smart made seven   and scored 27 points, and Bradley had 20 points for the Celtics. They were given little chance after losing by 44 in Game 2 and then losing Thomas for the rest of the postseason because of a hip injury. “Everybody had to step up their game tonight especially with one of our brothers down,” Smart said. “Our love and support goes out to Isaiah. We wish he could be here but we understand. We just kept fighting. Everybody did their part. ” Kyrie Irving scored 29 points, and Kevin Love had 28 for Cleveland. The Cavaliers dropped to   in the postseason with their first loss since Game 4 of last year’s Finals.  LeBron James had one of the worst games of his postseason career, finishing with 11 points and six turnovers.  “I had a tough game, period  —   not just in the second half,” James said. “Me personally, I didn’t have it. My   did a great job of keeping us in the game, building that lead. But me personally, I didn’t have it. That’s all I’ve got to say about my performance. ” Still, the Cavs were in control leading   in the third quarter after making 14   in the first half. But Cleveland got complacent, Boston got hot and the Celtics, who arrived at Quicken Loans Arena earlier on Sunday morning for their shootaround without Thomas and looking somewhat defeated, never gave up. They caught the Cavs at   on Smart’s   and then matched the Cavs basket for basket in the final minutes in one of the most entertaining games of what he been a mostly boring postseason. Boston’s Jonas Jerebko’s baseline jumper put the Celtics ahead   with 30 seconds left before Irving scored on a drive to tie it with 10. 7 seconds left. Following a timeout, the Celtics worked the ball to Bradley, who found himself open and then calmly knocked down a shot that goes straight into Celtics lore. For Cleveland, the loss was a   call on their march toward a possible third straight Finals and a seemingly inevitable rematch with Golden State. The Cavs had been playing a glorified game of H. O. R. S. E. with the Warriors, who are undefeated and can complete a sweep of San Antonio on Monday. The Cavs hadn’t lost in the postseason since Game 4 of last year’s finals, and they came in tied with the   Los Angeles “Showtime” Lakers for the longest winning streak in postseason history. With Thomas back home, the Celtics could be forgiven for feeling down after Thomas, their inspirational leader was shut down with a hip injury he first sustained in March. However, coach Brad Stevens liked his team’s energy leading up to tipoff and felt confident they would play hard. “Our guys are itching to play,” he said. “Obviously, we’re here for a reason, and we’ve got   competitive guys who have largely been guys that have had to really earn their way up in this league. ” They earned their way back into the series. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Cleveland.",-0.5
"Meet The Teenage Girl Who Wants to Be A Boy Scout. According to the Boy Scout Law, ”a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.” But does a Boy Scout have to be a boy? Sydney Ireland has been involved with scouting since she was four years old, when she began tagging along with her older brother to Cub Scout meetings. Since then, she has been an unofficial, but enthusiastic, member of Troop 414 in Manhattan. Now she is 16, and she’s pushing Boy Scouts of America to allow girls like her to become official members. Over the years, Sydney’s activities with the troop have included camping trips, hiking, archery, ice climbing and, yes,  . As a city kid, she has learned to cherish a connection to the outdoors and she credits the Boy Scouts for helping to foster it. But although the local troop has welcomed Sydney’s participation, she is not able to officially earn merit badges and advance in rank along with the boys around her, because she is a girl. According to national policy, the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts only enroll boys  —   including transgender boys, as of earlier this year. But Sydney is a girl. And, to her, the policy doesn’t feel fair. For the last few years, she has been asking the Boy Scouts of America to let girls officially join through letters to national leadership, public   and a Change. org petition. ”I just want to see a change,” she said. ”Right now they’re discriminating against girls, and I’m just calling it as it is.” The Boy Scouts of America declined an interview and would not comment on whether the organization plans to review their policy. However, Director of Communications Effie Delimarkos did say that the organization ”continually works with Scout Executives to evaluate and improve programs to better serve youth participants.” Delimarkos also wrote: ”We understand the values and lessons of Scouting are attractive to the entire family. The Boy Scouts of America serves boys and young men through the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, which are   programs specifically for boys in the first grade through age 18.” Delimarkos noted that the Boy Scouts of America does offer   programs, such as an outdoor adventure initiative called Venturing. But Venturing starts only at age 14, and it does not offer the same opportunities to earn merit badges as the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts do. Sydney specifically wants a shot at becoming an Eagle Scout, like her older brother, Bryan. Sydney has earned ample support for her endeavor, including from fellow scouts and the National Organization for Women. But her critics inevitably ask the same question: Why don’t you just join the Girl Scouts? ”I know that almost everything that the Boy Scouts do, I want to do,” Sydney said. ”And if they’re identical programs, then why are they separate?” The Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts are two distinct, private organizations. While there may be some overlap in activities or their core missions of fostering leadership skills, they offer different programs. Even the Girl Scouts say as much. ”No, we’re not meant to be the girl equivalent of the Boy Scouts,” said Andrea Bastiani Archibald, who serves as the ”Chief Girl Expert,” at Girl Scouts of the USA. Archibald does tout the Girl Scouts as a group that is welcoming to all girls and their interests, be it art or the outdoors. ”But if it doesn’t feel right for them,” Archibald said, ”I really laud their parents and those girls for finding space that is.” Sydney takes scouting and the skills involved so seriously that she has sought membership in troops outside the U. S. She is a full,   member of a troop in Ontario, Canada  —   one of dozens of countries with   scouting. In fact, Sydney recently earned the Chief Scout’s Award, Canada’s highest honor in scouting, and has the badge and a letter of congratulations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to show for it. But she is determined to become an Eagle Scout as a full member of Troop 414, reaching the top achievement of an organization she has been part of nearly her entire life.",-0.5
"CNN: Trump & Obama briefed on Russian leverage campaign. CNN has a lengthy new report by a group of reporters — including Jake Tapper, Evan Perez, Carl Bernstein and Jim Sciutto — claiming that U.S. intelligence officials have warned Trump that Russia is trying to compromise him. What's new: Trump and Obama were briefed last week on a two-page synopsis of a report compiled by a former British spy at the behest of opposition researchers. The briefers were the heads of the four main intelligence agencies: The FBI, CIA, NSA and Director of National Intelligence. The briefing was on ""allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump..."" What we already knew: A former European intel operative had compiled a report claiming ties between Trump and Russia. A story on this ran in Mother Jones the week before the election. What we still don't know: CNN claims to have seen the memos that sourced the report, but they aren't reporting on details because they can't independently verify them. The FBI is looking into the details and also hasn't verified them. We also don't know the identities of the figures in Trumpworld supposedly tied to Russia. The original Mother Jones story cites Paul Manafort. CNN doesn't, but gives credit to Mother Jones for the original story. What's next: Sen. Ron Wyden called out FBI Director Comey today, asking whether the FBI report on this will go public before the inauguration. Comey said no.",0.0
"Comedian Wanda Sykes Booed Off Stage after Anti-Trump Rant. Comedian Wanda Sykes confronted a Boston audience Saturday night after she was booed for making disparaging comments about   Donald Trump at a charity   comedy event. [The    comedian and actress was about five minutes into her set at the Cam Neely Foundation’s 22nd annual Comics Come Home fundraiser at TD Garden when she was loudly booed for attacking Trump.  “It’s going to be okay,” Sykes had said. “I am certain this is not the first time we’ve elected a racist, sexist, homophobic president. He ain’t the first one. He’s just the first confirmed one. ” When the comment caused many in the audience to jeer, Sykes appeared to shout expletives at some individuals in the audience and later flipped them the middle finger. “The evidence is there,” she added as the crowd began to boo. “How could you say he’s not racist? Grab them by the p*ssy? How could you say he’s not sexist?” (Warning: Strong Language) Sykes reportedly stayed onstage to finish her performance despite the booing, according to the Boston Herald. The paper reported that comedian Nick DiPaolo was also booed over political material in his set. The annual Comics Come Home fundraiser features local   comics and is held to raise money for adult and child cancer patients and their families. Sykes is not the only comedian to have been roundly booed for making comments critical of Trump in October, hundreds of audience members reportedly stood up and walked out of an Amy Schumer concert when the comedian bashed Trump, calling him an “orange,   monster. ” Schumer later read an open letter to those   fans in which she vowed she would attend rehab to learn how to “make all people happy. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",1.0
"Does Method Acting Disadvantage Actresses?. Readers discuss representation in Hollywood and other realms of entertainment from the perspective of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and political bent. Share your own thoughts via hello@theatlantic. com. Angelica Jade Bastién’s popular essay about how Hollywood has ruined method acting culminates in a theory that “the gendered nature of modern method acting has had the unfortunate consequence of sidelining the transformative work of actresses who found authenticity without billing themselves as somehow ‘above’ their art form. ” A reader, Kelly, isn’t persuaded: I’m all for gender equality, but this seems like a stretch. At the very least, it certainly doesn’t get to the root of the problem. (Hint: It has nothing to do with method acting.) If Leo [DiCaprio] wants to eat a bison heart because he thinks it’s going to improve his performance, by all means. I don’t think that necessarily makes this the new standard for acting, as referenced by Jared Leto taking a similar approach and failing.  Another reader disagrees with Kelly and reiterates several points made in the piece: Yes, but the exaltation of this particular brand of method acting that has so closely been associated with showy, masculine feats of endurance is a part of stigmas around gender differences. Men can engage in this brand of method acting and often be praised whereas women largely cannot, and when they are praised it’s because of the bravery in not being beautiful. In this way, what we consider to be great acting has benefited one gender disproportionately, and more specifically it helps obscure brilliant performances by actresses (and actors) who either don’t practice this brand of method acting or simply engage in another method. Kelly’s reply: I get what you’re saying, but again, I don’t think it gets down to the root of the problem. It’s societal stigma (what’s acceptable for men vs. women) and doesn’t have much to do with method acting specifically. Not to mention, I don’t think many would classify the Joker or what Leto did to get into character [gifting the cast a dead pig, a live rat, used condoms] as “masculine. ” The Joker is not a masculine character and neither are his actions. The point is he’s supposed to be crazy and maniacal, not muscular, valiant, strapping, or brave. Quite the opposite actually. I agree that method acting antics are disproportionately accepted more with male actors than with female actors, but if the end product is the same, is it really a problem? I guess the best example I can use is the one bright spot of Suicide Squad: Margot Robbie. She’s thus far gained critical acclaim in the role of Harley Quinn. No, Robbie didn’t use method acting, but she gave a performance that was just as, if not more, eccentric than Leto’s, and people seem to appreciate it despite the fact that she’s not portraying a stereotypical cutesy female character (though she is in a somewhat skimpy outfit). Bottom line: Gender biases certainly exist in Hollywood, but it’s much farther reaching than the ways in which actors choose to prepare for a role. The following clip illustrates very well the narcissistic,    showboating of method actors like Jared Leto, who interrupts Robbie when she’s telling a story of how the movie’s director cut off parts of her hair: (Side note regarding Kelly’s point about Robbie’s “somewhat skimpy outfit”: In the above clip, a publicity shot of Leto in character is also very skimpy, and it elicits a lot of hollers from women in the audience. Both genders are sexified these days when it comes to superheroes and villains.) Another reader, Christopher, joins Kelly in skepticism: The main thesis of the essay is how women and men cannot engage in the same sort of preparation because of gendered expectations, and the male avenue is more highly regarded and so it forms a sort of oppressive force against actresses. It’s an interesting point, because it is very closely connected to the Hollywood appropriation of the life of the   in the marketing material.  I’m not sure if the thesis as argued holds very well, though. I say this not because I think the central point is incorrect, but because I think “extreme method acting” makes people scoff as much as it makes people interested in seeing it.  For example, if no one knew what Leo did for The Revenant, I don’t think fewer people would have seen it, but even if they did, I think it’s fair to mention how so much of the criticism against that movie and his performance was specifically about how he prepared. (But I guess Hollywood doesn’t necessarily care what people are saying about a movie just as long as they’re talking about it.) Christopher’s point about scoffing is a strong one, especially in the case of DiCaprio. The conventional wisdom during this past Oscar season was that DiCaprio —  with five Oscar nominations but no wins before The Revenant —  was so desperate to finally get a gold statue that he sought the role of an emotionally brutalized and physically tortured frontiersman (punctuated by a graphic mauling from a momma grizzly) and then prepared for the role by battling hypothermia, eating raw liver as a vegetarian, and sleeping in animal carcasses. It smelled desperate. And that desperation was widely mocked in memes: Personally I thought Tom Hardy’s performance in The Revenant was much better than DiCaprio’s, and I suspect the latter was given an Oscar because he had come so close so many times. I genuinely laughed out loud at the film’s final shot, when DiCaprio breaks the fourth wall with a    gaze —  as if to say, “Pleeeeease can I have an Oscar now   …     ” Imagine this scene with a gold statue standing in for the woman: Back to Christopher, who wonders: Is it true that an actress would not be praised for engaging in the same   acting as her male counterparts?  I understand why it would be assumed to be the case, as the article points out, but I am legitimately unsure if a movie comes out and touts, say, Jennifer Lawrence, as being so committed to her role that she lived in the woods by herself for three months with nothing but a compass and a blanket to prepare for her character, that there would be a negative reaction. I mean, Charlize Theron did win an Oscar for Monster, and it’s fairly offensive to say it’s just because she chose not to be pretty. Speaking of method performances from actresses who won critical and popular praise, I asked readers in a previous note for more examples, and many of them delivered.  One reader points to Hilary Swank’s   performance in Million Dollar Baby. Swank is one of the most famous method actors of the past 20 years, and here’s how she prepared —  and suffered —  for that role: [G]oing method was the only way for her to truly get to grips with her character. So “acting like a boxer” becomes “actually being a boxer” in this case, which —  as you probably guessed —  lead poor Miss Swank on the path towards death. As a result of having to “pivot” excessively whilst training for the movie’s now famous boxing scenes, Swank picked up   …     a Staph infection, which —  left untreated —  is usually fatal. “I got a blister, the size of my palm, on my right foot, and it was really swollen, and I couldn’t train and walk on it,” she said in an interview afterwards. “So I popped it myself, and it got infected. ” What’s more, Swank didn’t bother to tell director Clint Eastwood about her injury as she didn’t want to slow down production . .. But that’s not all from Swank she also won an Oscar for her emotionally grueling performance in Boys Don’t Cry: Swank’s early experience in method acting would pay dividends when she was cast in Kimberly Peirce’s devastating drama about Brandon Teena, a   transgendered man who was brutally raped and murdered in a Nebraska hate crime. “I walked around trying to pass as a boy for five weeks before filming that movie,” she says. “Seeing what worked and what didn’t work, and losing a bunch of body fat so that my face would be thinner. My neighbors thought that I was my cousin Billy from Iowa. ” Among the other   winners for Best Actress are Sally Field and Jane Fonda —  two of the most famous method actors of the Boomer generation. Another reader points to, well, The Reader —  specifically Kate Winslet’s   performance. Her suffering for that film was psychological: Kate Winslet was so focused on accurately portraying her character in THE READER she struggled to return to    life after filming wrapped. The actress plays a former Nazi concentration camp guard in the   drama, and put all her emotions into the intense role. And Winslet   …     admits it took months for her to bid farewell to the character. She says, “It’s like I’ve escaped from a serious car accident and need to understand what has just happened. ” The next example of method acting comes from a reader who points to Anne Hathaway losing 25 pounds and cutting off all her hair for an   performance in Les Miserables. She masterfully plays Fantine, an   impoverished mother who is forced into prostitution to provide for her young daughter. The most heartrending scene: Another reader notes Natalie Portman’s   performance in Black Swan. To prepare for that disturbing role of descending into madness, Portman lost 20 pounds, did a year of intensive ballet training, and performed much of her own dancing. For example: Yet another reader points to   Halle Berry for being a   purveyor of method acting. Here’s a look at some of her roles: When Berry first came on the scene in her first motion picture, Jungle Fever, she did not bathe for more than a week, in order to bring realness to her character. In her 2003 film, Gothika, Berry was so dedicated to the role, that she ended up breaking her arm in one of her scenes, with Robert Downey, Jr. Needless to say the production was down for at least eight weeks, while the actress healed. In The Call, Berry did her own stunts. To prepare for the emotional demands of her character, Berry worked with real life dispatchers, listening to their phone calls and observing their behavior, mannerisms, and protocol. Here’s Berry in Jungle Fever: Lastly, one more reader notes Rooney Mara’s   performance in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, a disturbing thriller that includes a horrifying rape scene that Mara had to endure. Here’s how she partly prepared for the role of Lisbeth, a tough and fiercely independent hacker: [Mara] didn’t even have ear piercings. She felt that to truly inhabit the character, multiple piercings all over her body were necessary. Mara had her lip, brow, nose, nipples and ears pierced. She said, “because of all the tattoos and the makeup and the piercings, and the physical transformations my body has to go through, it would always feel sort of like I was in costume, even if I was naked. Do you have an example to include? Have any thoughts about this discussion in general? Drop us a note: hello@theatlantic. com. Opening with the egregious example of Jared Leto playing The Joker in Suicide Squad, Angelica Jade Bastién takes aim at the ostentatious way Hollywood is using method acting in recent years. She observes: [M]ethod acting of this sort couldn’t exist without the culture of permissiveness and indulgence Hollywood has fostered over the years. For the last few decades, particularly after Robert De Niro’s infamous body transformation for 1980’s Raging Bull, which netted him an Oscar, method acting has become a critical factor in the campaigns of actors seeking trophies. Actors like Daniel   Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christian Bale, and particularly Leonardo DiCaprio have spoken about how they lose themselves in roles —  gaining weight, whittling themselves down, never breaking character, taking on accents and hobbies that affect their personal life. I love this observation from a reader: The hilarious thing is that the more actors talk about their Method acting, the more attention it calls to their acting in the movie, thus breaking the suspension of disbelief. Of course, this assumes that their goal is actually to heighten their art, as opposed to win trophies or gain popularity. I had a similar feeling about Leto’s overrated and not believable method performance as a trans woman in Dallas Buyer’s Club: Another reader looks to a difference performance from a   method actor: There’s a great story I heard once that happened on the set of Marathon Man. Upon being asked by Lawrence Olivier how a previous scene had gone, one in which Dustin Hoffman’s character had supposedly stayed up for three days, Hoffman claimed that he too had not slept for 72 hours to achieve emotional verisimilitude. “My dear boy,” replied Olivier, “why don’t you just try acting?” It didn’t quite go down that way. Here’s a clip of Hoffman’s response to that apocryphal anecdote: Another reader takes the opportunity to snipe at Hoffman: Putting aside acting methods, Hoffman is one of the worst actors. It’s a blessing that he rarely works. He is constantly drawing attention to himself, letting you know how hard he is acting. There is no sincerity in Hoffman’s acting it’s all a front. (Meryl Streep suffers from the same   one is always extremely aware that one is watching Meryl Streep act, not a character on the screen.) The English conservatory approach has trained many more exceptional actors than the   method, in my opinion. Another reader quips about Hoffman, “But he did give his all to portray a tomato in Tootsie he Became that tomato. ” This next reader goes into great depth over the English conservatory approach (and I’ve embedded clips throughout): British actors of Olivier’s generation certainly didn’t use The Method, and it’s true that recorded performances by John Gielgud, Olivier et al appear “hammy” and unnatural, even by theatrical standards. But as Ian McKellen has remarked: What modern audiences think of Olivier’s acting now is irrelevant. The important thing is that the audiences who saw him live cried when he died, laughed when he did something amusing, and empathised with his characters they believed him. And that is the actor’s goal. Of course what audiences want from theatre and film changes over the years and, as a consequence, so do tastes in acting styles. Hence why Olivier’s performances are now unpalatable, even laughable, to many. Contemporary British actors now receive a comprehensive training (usually over a     study period) in a variety of approaches to acting. The most reputed drama schools will train their students in Strasberg’s Method, Sanford Meisner’s techniques, Stella Adler’s techniques, Stanislavski’s System (with the most weight being given to Stanislavski, as his system is the most complete, and the root of the works of the other practitioners) with additional training in the work of Le Coq, Michael Chekhov, and Uta Hagen (to name a few). These approaches to acting are complemented with classes in movement, dance, body conditioning, voice, singing, clowning, and improvisation. British drama schools offer the most comprehensive and   actor training in the Western hemisphere and remain the most   from international students who are serious about pursuing a career in acting. The problem with restricting yourself to Strasberg’s Method alone is that it’s incomplete. Strasberg’s aim in developing The Method was to take the work of Stanislavski and to adapt it for contemporary performers. The trouble was Strasberg had only ever read Stanislavski’s first book, An Actor Prepares, which details such staples of Strasberg’s Method as emotional memory. Not long after publishing that book, Stanislavski witnessed first hand the physical, emotional, and mental toll that his system took on a young Michael Chekhov (who would later go on to become a significant theatre practitioner in his own right). This experience led Stanislavski to develop his work to be more holistic, and complete, with a great emphasis on what he called the psychophysical. He wrote two subsequent books on acting in which he did not precisely disown his earlier writings, but refined them within the context of his new ideas. Strasberg does not appear to have had access to these later writings (at least when he was developing his Method). Sanford Meisner and Stella Adler are two American practitioners who felt that Stanislavski’s later writings were of equal importance, and worked them into their own working practices and teachings, which are far more complete than Strasberg’s. Couple of little corrections to the article   …     Daniel Day Lewis has expressed discomfort at being labelled a Method Actor. He’s gained a reputation for being “the actor who stays in character all the time on set,” but as he has said, he only does this as he feels it’s a better use of his time than sitting around having a drink and a chat with the other actors. If he stays in character between takes and scenes he might discover something new about the character that he hadn’t thought of before and that he could bring into the next take or scene. Here’s a brilliant scene in There Will Be Blood of that actor playing a character who’s acting: Back to our reader: Other stories about Daniel Day Lewis’s immersion in the parts he plays tend to be exaggerated, and the truth behind them seems more to do with his personality than any strict adherence to The Method. He’s a naturally curious man, so his research often becomes   (he learnt how to build a canoe for The Last of the Mohicans, for example). But it’s not restricted to his work as an actor he learnt how to make shoes just because it intrigued him. Marlon Brando has also always rejected the (what he saw as) accusation that he was a Method Actor. In fact he seemed to take quite a dim view of Strasberg and his work, describing him as “an ambitious, selfish man who exploited the people who attended the Actors Studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshipped him, but I never knew why. ” Brando credits Stella Adler and Elia Kazan as being the people who taught him to act. Here’s a compelling clip of Brando blurring the lines between professional acting and everyday acting by ordinary people: On that note, here’s another passage from Angelica Jade Bastién —  and an especially adept one in an overall compelling piece —  touching on the macho insecurity that compels many actors to go method: Brando never went to the extremes of those who came after him, but his career and outlook provide the template for those who see themselves as his successors. Beyond his obsessive dedication to the form, Brando was   about his choice of career. He saw acting as inferior to the kind of work a “real” man would do.  By going method, a performer can signal that he works for his art he can make his labor visible. This attitude has lived on today, and comes through in how [Christian] Bale once framed his career for Esquire: “I have a very sissy job, where I go to work and get my hair done, and people do my makeup, and I go and say lines and people spoil me rotten. This is just not something to be quite as proud of as many people would have you believe. ” Bastién goes on to press the case that double standards over method acting are “sidelining the transformative work of actresses. ” Do you have any favorite method performances by women, or thoughts about the topic more generally? Drop us a note and we’ll post: hello@theatlantic. com. For my part, here’s Ellen Burstyn in Requiem For a Dream —  an   performance that outshines all her costars, especially Jared Leto: In December, I wrote an Atlantic story about how the Internet led to the decline of female film critics at prominent media outlets. The piece noted a sad irony about women and film media in 2016: At a moment when checking up on the role of women in front of and behind the camera is a popular topic with news organizations and amongst film reviewers, women write just 18 percent of top reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and constitute less than a quarter of membership in the four top national critics’ associations. I called for news and media outlets to make a deliberate effort to hire women writers and editors, because the stakes are high: As one study showed, critics tend to write about films helmed by members of their own sex, and reviews have been shown to influence audience attendance and   totals. Even in the Internet age, critics matter. At the time of my writing, I argued there was reason to hope. That BuzzFeed, Time, and The Village Voice had just hired women for prominent   positions in the past two years seemed, to me, a solid reason to be optimistic that media organizations had made hiring women a top priority. But yesterday, the film blog Women and Hollywood put a damper on my assertion that prominent publications have “doubled down on their commitment to women writers. ” In a story called “The Dudeocracy of Film Writers,” the blog’s editors note “a bothersome trend” over the past month —  many prominent   jobs have recently gone to men. The new chief film critic at Variety and the Los Angeles Times, senior film critic and film reporter at Indiewire, the film staff writer at Rolling Stone, and editorial director and editor at Film Comment are all men. The editors at Women and Hollywood write they have received plaintive messages from women film writers who are “flabbergasted,” frustrated, and themselves struggling to land staff positions. It’s important to take the Women and Hollywood story with a grain of salt. The editors did not reach out for comment from hiring editors, who may have told them they initially contacted women to fill those positions. Editors may have added that some hiring decisions have occurred in tandem with internal promotions of women (Kate Erbland, for instance, became film editor at Indiewire) or emphasized that at least one of those hired men —  Justin Chang, now the chief film critic at the Los Angeles Times —  fills other, gaping diversity holes in film criticism (in his case,   critics). And as one writer pointed out to me on Twitter, the article didn’t note two other major, recent hires: While the Village Voice has a new male film critic, MTV News recently brought a woman on to be its lead film critic. But the Women and Hollywood story nevertheless provides a crucial   on the ongoing, disappointing conversation. I’m grateful to the blog for ending its own addition to this depressing dialogue on a high note —  with a list of women critics to read. You can find those writers (follow them!) here. A reader suggests there are limited career opportunities, or at least “perceived” limited opportunities, for certain minorities outside of professional sports: When reading one of your notes yesterday, the phrase “disproportionate diversity” jumped out at me. It just doesn’t quite make sense to me unless diversity is understood as a simple code for the inclusion of “minorities,” which would be disappointingly revealing of a perspective insufficiently critical and careful in its engagement with race. Diversity may often be used as code for simply including numbers of minorities below and or up to their proportionate demographic levels, but that cheapens the concept. Can you have a disproportionate representation of minorities in sports? If your only metric is demographic proportions, sure. But if you survey the field of opportunities perceived to be truly open to minorities and the ways in which minorities have been and continue to be systematically shut out of careers by both personal and institutional biases, then I think the disproportionality becomes a reflection of the realities of minorities’ perceptions of the avenues open to them. Another reader suggests that such a perception could be  : Is extreme overrepresentation of black men in pro sports actually the result of underlying social issues? Becoming a professional athlete requires a person to both have the genetics and then work extremely hard from the time you’re a child. If you do both of those, and don’t sustain serious injury, there is a remote chance of a sustained career as a professional athlete. In short, being a child working primarily with the goal of becoming a professional athlete is essentially playing the lottery with your own life. And isn’t playing the lottery an irrational decision that taxes the poor? For every professional athlete, there are thousands left in the wake who don’t fare nearly as well.   Should ANYONE work that hard from the time they’re a child in hopes of a remote chance of making a professional sport? The hard work that the tens of thousands of kids are putting in today in hopes of getting drafted in the 2029 NBA draft is potentially coming at the expense of other interests, with most of those interests carrying much better career potential than playing basketball six hours a day as an eight year old. If you’re that same eight year old, you’re relying on others around you to provide these other interests. If you’re poor, each of those interests can grow to represent “a way out. ” So, looking back, is today’s overrepresentation of black men in professional sports the result primarily of an overrepresentation of    black boys in the 1990s who felt they had no other way out? That could lead to a tragic irony even when educational and job opportunities open up nationwide, there will inevitably be a lag in the perception that those opportunities are attainable, and thus some young people won’t be as prepared to seize them. (Video: The first of seven YouTube installments of the   1994 documentary Hoop Dreams.) Responding to Lenika’s piece about the small percentage of Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans in Hollywood, a reader snarks, “Just look at that racist NBA: Whites and Latinos are terribly  ” —  74. 4 percent of the players are Black, 23. 3 percent are White, 1. 8 percent are Hispanic, and 0. 2 percent are Asian. That supposed double standard was echoed in the comments section of Julia Lee’s piece for us today about how Asian Americans are often discouraged by their parents from going into the arts. But this reader makes a key distinction when it comes to professional acting and pro sports: While there is some subjectivity, who’s hired in the NBA and NFL comes down to beating the clock, scoring, and yardage. Those three things have no opinions nor feelings. And regarding the hugely disproportionate percentage of Black players in the NBA and NFL, the reader notes, “Those are leagues where the white guys hire all the black guys. ” As far as the coaches? Here’s a snapshot of the NFL from The New York Times last year: Among the league’s hundreds of assistant coaches, 16 percent were members of minority groups in 1991 that proportion increased to 36 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2013. [The NFL is] where 67 percent of the players were   in 2013, according to data published by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. This season, five out of the 32 head coaches are Black —  or nearly 16 percent, just ahead of the percentage of African Americans nationwide —  in addition to just one Hispanic coach. Regarding the NBA, here’s a snapshot from FiveThirtyEight in 2014:   …     43. 3 percent of NBA coaches were black compared with just 2 percent of the league’s majority owners (of the NBA’s 49 majority owners, Michael Jordan of the Charlotte Bobcats was the only person of color, according to Lapchick’s data). With that context in mind, do you have any strong views about diversity in pro sports, or the entertainment industry more generally? Drop us an email. Meanwhile, this reader broadens the debate even further: What about religious diversity? Do all religious groups receive proportional treatment or are certain groups under or overrepresented? Do evangelical Christians receive adequate representation in the Academy and the Oscars? Is the Academy the problem? Minority actors get just 15% of top roles —  and 15% of nominations https:  .  pic. twitter.  A reader responds to Lenika’s essay examining diversity in Hollywood beyond Black and White —  namely to Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans: I appreciate the inclusion of multiple viewpoints within the rubric of diversity. What some of the commenters on this essay seem to disdain is the idea that everyone wants an award, a good part in a movie, fame, and success just for being from a particular background. May I respectfully suggest that what a lot of people actually want is to see stories that reflect their experience, their intelligence, their sense of compassion, and their sense of complexity. It is a difficult issue to see what any of us (myself included) do not experience directly, but rather filtered, if presented at all, through stereotypes or distant stories that reduce people —  real people —  to convenient parts of a machine that glorifies someone else. Did you, on the other hand, have any problems with the piece? Drop us an email. A few more readers sound off: I would like to make a point regarding the quote from Joel Coen. I agree with him that shoehorning in a specific type of character in order to appease some general notion of inclusivity is a bad idea because it will be immediately obvious to the audience and it would hurt the story. The Coen brothers’ own biases about the stories they want to tell and the identities of the characters whose stories are told are completely shaped by their experiences. If a casting director, screenwriter, or director has a very narrow experience with specific types of people, then he or she will not even begin to think about casting, writing, or directing for people that do not fit that experience. It doesn’t occur to them that this is the case because they are blinded by their own biases. The issue is not that we cannot have biases, because that is impossible. We each bring to the table that which we know. But I believe that diversity among casting directors, screenwriters, and directors would translate to a greater proportion of interesting stories about characters that everyone would want to see because they would not be “Black stories,” “Hispanic stories,” or “Asian stories. ” They would be stories that happen to include characters whose backgrounds are diverse and no one would need to fill a quota because it would be intrinsic to the scriptwriting and casting process. A plurality of voices in positions of power and influence in film will be needed for this to happen. This reader also addresses the famed directors: It’s funny, but as a Latino, I would love to see a movie the Coen Brothers could direct “that involves four black people, three Jews, and a dog,” as they put it. With their irreverent, twisted sense of humor, I honestly think this could work. And that’s ultimately the problem: So many decision makers in Hollywood have a fantastically cramped view of minority experiences. There needn’t be a quota —   just a simple acknowledgment that minorities can also be cast in movies about weirdos in the L. A. suburbs, or darkly comic murder mysteries in Minnesota. It is this severe lack of imagination on the part of Hollywood gatekeepers that is fueling to this growing backlash from minorities. This reminds me of a conversation I had with an alleged white hipster girl from Williamsburg on The Atlantic’s comments section about Lena Dunham’s exclusion of minorities on her show Girls. This woman was highly offended that minorities would dare challenge Dunham, because Dunham was describing “her” reality, and in “her” reality there were no minorities anywhere. So why should the minorities then butt in and demand that Dunham include them in her show? I had to retort that there are hipsters who are black and Latino, that some live   cosseted, prickish lifestyles, and that I know a bunch of them myself. It worried me deeply that Dunham isolates herself (intentionally or unintentionally) so thoroughly in a   island in the most diverse city in the world, where there is a surfeit of overprivileged black or Latino hipsters. The reader got huffy, responded more or less that she wasn’t racist, and we let it go. But the very act of isolation is the racism that minorities are trying to get some of these gatekeepers to understand. But then the gatekeepers get highly offended, which leads to a backlash of the backlash.  It’s not pretty, but this is how progress happens. This will be a long and   slog, but Hollywood will be changed. It has happened in other hidebound institutions, and it will happen in this one too. Another reader wants to broaden the debate: African Americans are   in the popular music industry compared to other groups. Should that   balance off   in the   industry? Should we start a campaign to reduce   involvement in the popular music industry so that underrepresented groups like whites and Asians can chart more hits songs? Should every industry be demographically representative, or is it OK if some demographic groups gravitate to specific industries? And as mentioned in the article, do Africans, Asians, and Latinos count if they are not     or Latinos born in the USA? Want to tackle one of those questions or any of the points raised thus far?

"Since When Do I Have to Support Trump Just Because He’s the Front-Runner?. By Jonah Goldberg, EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is Jonah Goldberg’s weekly “news”letter, the  . Subscribe here to get the   delivered to your inbox on Fridays. Dear Reader (including those of you in D. C. who may try to burn this “news”letter in a desperate attempt to stay alive during the snowstorm), Well, here we go. That’s a bad turn of phrase, since we’re neither sh** nor fan. We’re more like a lighthouse amidst the   or at least we try to be. This seems lost on a lot of people these days. I keep hearing from folks who seem to think that if Donald Trump is popular or the   then National Review  —   and yours truly  —   must bow to the popular will. Get with the program, they say. See the writing on the wall. Get out in front of this. Instead, we went a different way, and the brickbats are flying in. We’ve disgraced ourselves, they insist. We’ve gone and read ourselves out of the conservative movement. Betrayed William F. Buckley. NR FEATURE: Against Trump, And that’s the calm and reasonable stuff. If say, you, offered some of the tantrums I’ve received in person instead of via   and Twitter, the only reasonable response would be to call for the orderlies and ask how you slipped out of your restraints. So before we get into it, let me just say up front that rather than this being a low point or an epic fail or a betrayal, this is in fact one of National Review’s finest moments. If it costs us subscribers, or readers, or advertisers (all of which I doubt) so be it. What is it the Marines say? “Pain is weakness leaving the body. ” Well, such losses to National Review would be like dross being skimmed off freshly forged steel. The Many Rooms in the Mansion of Wrong, I should be clear: I don’t think everyone who supports Donald Trump is dross. Some are even friends of mine. But I do think they, collectively, are wrong. But they are wrong for different reasons. Indeed, there’s a remarkable diversity of wrongness out there. Some people believe there are no gradations of wrong that wrong is an absolute state. Not so. There are whole hierarchies of wrong. If you think 2+2 is 5, you’re a little wrong. If you think 2+2 is a   lizard destroying downtown Tokyo, you’re very wrong. Similarly, there are errors based on different kinds of thinking. Many of the people lambasting National Review are arguing ad populum. The people  —   here defined as a plurality of GOP poll respondents or   listeners  —   are for Trump, therefore Trump is not only the right candidate, but he must be a conservative, too. As I mentioned above, my favorite form of this fallacious argument is that National Review is  —   or I personally am  —   required (required!) to support the GOP  . When Donald Trump signed that pledge to support the GOP nominee a few months ago, scads of people asked whether I would do likewise. Can they really not see the category error here? My job  —   our job  —   is to write and say the truth as I see it. That’s it. Of course we can be wrong. It’s happened plenty of times. But to think we should be wrong on purpose is to confuse National Review for a press release or a bit of   marketing. But the real irony of this “support the  ” nonsense is that it runs completely counter to the usual gripe we get  —   that we’re too supportive of the GOP. Which is it? Are we “GOPe” hacks carrying water for the party? Or are we fools and traitors for not backing the party   just because he’s the  ? Trump is a hero “because he fights. ” We are knaves and traitors because we fight back. RELATED: The Establishment vs. the Conservatives, I have another question: Now that the establishment is rallying to Trump, can I be   again if I stay critical of Trump? That’d be nice. The point here is that “ ” is not a synonym for “conservative,” as I wrote the other day in the Corner. One of the reasons I can’t stand the use and abuse of the term “establishment” is that it’s like a   pack mule carrying the load for an entire wagon train of assumptions. “ ” is almost entirely devoid of any ideological content whatsoever. An ideological category that can include Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Occupy Wall Street, the tea parties, Ted Cruz, Mark Levin, Rush Limbaugh, and Ben Carson is not a particularly meaningful one. Some reply, oh no, it shows that the people are angry! I hear this all the time. And I agree. And I’m angry too. But you know what? Being angry is not a frick’n argument. I’m angry that Washington has drowned the country in debt. I’m angry that Obama has been a failure. I’m also angry that broccoli doesn’t taste like chicken and that Fox canceled Firefly. Being angry is probably a necessary condition for fixing a lot of problems, but it isn’t sufficient to the task. And it isn’t a particularly powerful defense of Donald Trump. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Establishmentarians to the Left of Me, Establishmentarians to the Right of Me, I listened to Chuck Todd and John Heileman on Morning Joe earlier. They were saying National Review damaged Ted Cruz with our “Against Trump” issue because it muddied Cruz’s argument that the establishment was rallying to Trump against Cruz. National Review undermined that argument, they explained. If that’s true, as a political matter, that’s a shame. As an intellectual matter, that’s   crazy. There are, in fact, many establishments. One of them  —   the one Sarah Palin and many others claim is the most pernicious  —   is rallying to Donald Trump. The GOP consultant and K Street crowd is coming around to him, just like the crony capitalist ethanol lobby in Iowa is coming around. Robert Costa’s piece in the Washington Post is almost heartbreaking in this regard. Tim Pawlenty, for instance, has made peace with the wind blowing from Fifth Avenue. “The light bulb has gone on for a lot of people, and it wasn’t on a couple of months ago,” Pawlenty explained. “Even though he’s a billionaire from New York, he sounds and looks like somebody you’d meet in the heartland who’s ticked off about the economy and government, and he projects the strength that he’d actually do something about it,” Pawlenty told the Post. “He doesn’t look and sound like all the other politicians who yap and yap and don’t get anything done. ” And here’s Alex Castellanos: “With Trump, hey, it’s just a deal,” said Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist. “The primary’s one deal, that’s done. If he were to be the nominee, the next deal’s a general [election]. You can see him saying, ‘We had to do what we had to do to win the primary, but now’s the general, and we’ve got to beat Hillary.’ You can see him pivot on a dime. “But with Cruz, oof, you’re looking at a Republican Party that wouldn’t win the vote of a young person, a young woman or a minority for a generation,” Castellanos said. And here’s this from Jonathan Martin’s New York Times article: If Mr. Cruz were the party’s nominee, said Charles R. Black Jr. a lobbyist who has worked on numerous Republican presidential campaigns, “what would happen is a lot of the elected leaders and party elders would try to sit down and try to help Cruz run a better campaign, but he may not listen. Trump is another matter. ” “You can coach Donald,” Mr. Black said. “If he got nominated, he’d be scared to death. That’s the point he would call people in the party and say, ‘I just want to talk to you. ’” And finally, also from Martin’s piece: “We can live with Trump,” said Richard F. Hohlt, a veteran lobbyist, reflecting his colleagues’ sentiment at a Republican National Committee meeting last week in Charleston, S. C. “Do they all love Trump? No. But there’s a feeling that he is not going to layer over the party or install his own person. Whereas Cruz will have his own people there. ” Now, I like some of these people. But if you take a step back and look, that there is some hardcore,     unalloyed, 100 percent pure,            thinking goingon. They’re like K Street Neville Chamberlains standing in the door of the Prime Rib, proclaiming that Donald Trump is a man we can deal with. Or the City Watch in King’s Landing turning on Ned Stark. What was it Thomas More said? “Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world . . . but to have your calls returned at the Department of Commerce?” What National Review Is Not, The idea that National Review should be lumped in with that establishment is the kind of insight you can only discover after successfully inserting your entire cranium past your sphincter. The K    Republican establishment is conservative, but their conservatism is secondary to their need to make deals, maintain access, and, to be fair, win elections. That last bit is important. The Republican party is in the   business first and foremost. And that’s largely as it should be. That’s partly why former National Review publisher the late, great Bill Rusher always used to tell the new hires at NR to be on guard: “Politicians will always disappoint you. ” RELATED: Against Defeatism, Against Trump, The reason politicians will disappoint principled conservatives  —   and, for that matter, principled liberals and libertarians  —   is that there is always an inherent tradeoff between the purity of principle and the necessities of electoral politics and the limitations of what can be done via government action. National Review has always recognized this tension, which is immortalized in the rule of thumb that we should support “the most conservative candidate electable. ” Every conservative is supposed to believe that incentives matter. The incentive for the K   establishment is to keep their influence and their access. The incentives for the     wretches who run NR are different. I’m open to the complaint that our   has driven us to become too invested in an ideology that too few voters subscribe to. But if that’s the case, the remedy isn’t to abandon all principle and just join the mob. I’d rather go down with my ship, thank you very much. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  In the Matter of Cruz vs. Trump, The establishment even wheeled out poor Bob Dole like he was Deng Xiaoping pulled from obscurity in order to clarify doctrine for the Beltway apparatchiks. “I question his allegiance to the party,” Dole said of Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz. Where are the hidden cameras? We’re being punked, right? Look, I like Bob Dole, too. He’s a great American who served his country nobly and with great sacrifice. And it’s not that I think Ted Cruz is particularly loyal to the Republican party. I mean nobody thinks that. His penchant for    and   grandstanding makes him something like a   Arlen Specter. It should be said that Dole’s loyalty to the conservative movement always took a distant backseat to his loyalty to the GOP. This is the guy who told conservatives, “I’ll be anything you want me to be I’ll be Ronald Reagan if that’s what you want. ” RELATED: The Battle for the Soul of the Right, Regardless, in the binary context of Ted Cruz versus Donald Trump, Cruz is a veritable John C. Fremont. I know, I know, we’re not supposed to question Donald Trump’s ideological and partisan bona fides anymore. The fact that he gave so much money to Democrats  —   and said so many liberal things  —   stems from the fact that he was a businessman who had to work a corrupt system. We’re also, by the way, supposed to forgive the fact that he was part of that corrupt system, excelled in that corrupt system, and makes no apologies for being a product of that corrupt system. The argument often goes something like this: Trump Booster: “He made his living saying whatever he had to say and paying whomever he had to pay in order to get what he wanted. That’s just good business!” Me: “So why do you think that, at age 69, he’s completely changed his ways? Isn’t it more reasonable to assume he’s still saying whatever he has to say to get what he wants?” Trump Booster: [Long pause] “Oh, so you want Jeb. ” Look, I’ve never liked the reckless and indiscriminate way Ted Cruz  —   and his boosters  —   talked about the “Washington cartel” and the establishment. But, again, let’s define our terms. If you define the establishment as congressional leadership  —   specifically Mitch McConnell  —   then Cruz is objectively an   guy. He’s been peeing in Mitch McConnell’s cornflakes for four years. I have my disagreements with McConnell, but I think he often gets an unfair rap from his critics. But that’s not the point. The congressional establishment, which is very close to  —   but not the same as  —   the K   establishment prefers Trump because with Trump everything is negotiable (and because so many of them hate Ted Cruz personally). As Dole put it, Trump can “probably work with Congress, because he’s, you know, he’s got the right personality and he’s kind of a  . ” RELATED: A Cruz vs. Rubio Fight Would Electrify Conservatives, Maybe. But whom, exactly, would he deal with? We know that when he wants to build a casino or plump up the guest list at his wedding, he has no problem “dealing” with Democrats. Working with Congress in this context taps into the assumption that getting bad things done is better than getting nothing done. It’s like those infuriating scorecards showing that Congress hasn’t been “productive” simply because it hasn’t passed scads of new laws and regulations. (David Boaz is great at dismantling this Beltway canard.) I’m not saying Congress doesn’t need to get things done. We have more problems in this country than Bill Clinton has penicillin prescriptions. But is there anything in Trump’s persona or record that suggests he would feel bound to work with conservatives in Congress  —   or with Congress at all  —   if he didn’t get his way? His whole schtick is that he will do whatever it takes to get things done. The Constitution almost never enters the picture, and when it does, it’s always something tiny compared to Trump’s bigness. I think irrational hostility to Ted Cruz is blinding people to all manner of things, but particularly to how the system works. If Cruz were elected president, one thing we can be reasonably certain of is that he would want to be reelected. In order to be reelected, he would need to appear to have fulfilled at least some of his campaign promises. He would also need to be a better steward of constitutional norms than his predecessor, given that constitutionalism is his thing. Those two facts alone pretty much guarantee he would have to work with Congress, and not just Congress, but Republicans in Congress. Why? Because presidents have to work with Congress if they want to get their agenda implemented. That was true of Obama in his first term. In his second term, Obama tried to go the other way and has had some (infuriating and unconstitutional) success. But that other way really isn’t an option for Cruz. It almost certainly is an option for Donald Trump. Ted Cruz isn’t my first choice, mostly because I think he will have problems getting elected (though claims he’s unelectable go too far). I’d rather Rubio or Christie. In a   race of Cruz vs. Trump, however, it’s no contest. The whole point of trying to elect the most conservative candidate possible is premised on the idea that one is choosing among conservatives in the first place. Going by record and evidence, in that   sample, there’s only one conservative to pick. Various  Sundry, I had planned on writing about a whole bunch of different stuff today (eugenics, Hillary’s server, my ideal episode of Walking Dead, and how this prediction turned out to be half right).

Please follow the steps below, Updated at 4:05 p. m. NEWS BRIEF Shimon Peres, the former Israeli president, suffered a stroke with significant bleeding and was taken to hospital where he was sedated, the director of the hospital where he is being treated told reporters. 1st official update on Shimon Peres medical condition: ”Peres underwent stroke with significant bleeding. .. currently sedated” BREAKING: Hospital director: Israel’s Peres suffered stroke ’with lots of bleeding’ Chemi Peres, Peres’s son, told reporters: “This is a difficult time. We will have to make certain decisions. ” Peres was being treated at Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer. Peres’s office had initially reported that the    former president was conscious and stable, but he has suffered in recent years from ill health. Here’s more from the Times of Israel: Earlier this month, Peres underwent surgery to receive an artificial pacemaker, after he was diagnosed with an abnormal heart rhythm in July following a series of minor health scares. The implant was recommended by Peres’s doctors, including his personal physician, Dr. Raphi Walden, after he was diagnosed in July with atrial fibrillation. He suffered a mild heart attack in January and underwent a cardiac angioplasty to open a blocked artery. He had been hospitalized twice after suffering chest pains. The Israeli prime minister’s office tweeted that Benjamin Netanyahu “conveyed the prayers of the entire nation for former President Peres’ quick recovery. ” “PM Netanyahu spoke with the director of the Chaim Sheba Medical Center and was updated on the medical condition of former President Peres,” it said. Peres was born in Poland in 1923 and immigrated with his family in 1932 to what was then Palestine. During Israel’s war of independence, he was put in charge by David   of weapons purchases and military recruitment. Peres was elected to the Knesset in 1959. He was mostly associated with the Labor Party, but over the decades held major positions with all the major centrist and   parties in Israeli politics. Peres was known for his relatively dovish stance on the   peace process. Peres served in almost every major position in Israeli government over his more than six decades in political life: He was prime minister twice, and interim prime minister twice, as well. He was foreign minister in Yitzhak Rabin’s government, and his role in the talks that led to the Oslo Accords won him the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize (which he shared with Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader). Peres became president in 2007 for one   term. He retired in 2014, but has remained an influential figure in Israeli politics. ",-0.5

"Amid Fistfights, Turkey’s Parliament Backs a New Constitution - The New York Times. Turkey’s Parliament approved a proposed Constitution on Saturday that would cede even greater powers to the country’s president if endorsed in a national referendum, but the bitterly contested voting process was marred by screaming matches and physical altercations that sent at least three legislators to a hospital. The low point came when supporters of the governing Justice and Development Party, in an apparent attack on the floor of Parliament on Thursday, knocked off the artificial arm of the opposition politician Safak Pavey. A former United Nations diplomat, Ms. Pavey suffered injuries to the socket of her arm when the prosthesis was dislocated. She had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident years ago. Lawmakers have been debating the proposed Constitution since Jan. 9, and over the past week they have engaged in a protracted round of voting on each of the 18 articles in the document, often debating until the early hours  —   finishing at 3:15 a. m. Friday, for instance. The final vote on the Constitution took place early Saturday, The Associated Press reported. The final draft will be put to a national referendum. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forged an alliance between followers of his party and the   Nationalist Movement Party, or M. H. P. in an effort to gain enough votes to pass the new Constitution. He succeeded despite bitter criticism by opposition parties and the   Peoples’ Democratic Party, or H. D. P. Many of H. D. P. ’s legislators  —   including its    —   have been jailed by Mr. Erdogan’s government on terrorism charges. The proposed Constitution comes during a period of emergency rule, also approved by Parliament, in the wake of the failed coup attempt in July against Mr. Erdogan. Since then, he has ordered the dismissal of 100, 000 state employees and the jailing of more than 40, 000 others suspected of supporting the coup. He has also cracked down on the independent news media, jailing about 140 journalists in the past year, with at least 81 still in prison last month, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, more than in any other country. Critics say the new Constitution will give Mr. Erdogan even greater powers than he already has, enabling him to invoke much more sweeping emergency rule measures. Mr. Erdogan and his supporters say the changes would streamline   and end a system that divides power between a prime minister and a president. The current prime minister, Binali Yildirim, is an Erdogan supporter who favors the proposed changes. “Our relationship with the president is good,” Mr. Yildirim said this week in a television interview. “But tomorrow if there are two names with strong egos, this   situation could cause problems. The country would be unmanageable. ” Mr. Erdogan was prime minister from 2003 to 2014, the year he became president, taking over a post that had been largely ceremonial. However, his control over his party  —   known by the initials of its Turkish name, A. K. P.  —   enabled him to curtail the prime minister’s power, and he forced the resignation of Mr. Yildirim’s predecessor, Ahmet Davutoglu. The new Constitution would also allow a president to be the official head of his party, something not now permitted, but it would limit the president to two terms. “This has nothing to do with dictatorship, authoritarianism,” the president’s spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said in a speech last week. He said the changes would maintain separation of powers and democratic checks on the president: “Those two fundamental elements are protected. ” Opponents say the new Constitution would allow the president to appoint Supreme Court judges and take control of the budget away from Parliament. “It nullifies the unchangeable principles of the Constitution, the principles of being a secular, democratic republic with rule of law,” said an opposition lawmaker, Ali Seker. “This package is designing a regime according to the mood of one person. This is called dictatorship. ” Critics in Parliament say the jailing of at least 11 H. D. P. legislators, and the governing party’s insistence on   marathon sessions, has rushed through the new Constitution without time for the country to consider its provisions thoroughly. Even with the missing H. D. P. members, Mr. Erdogan’s party did not have a majority to carry the vote, turning instead to the M. H. P. rightists. The rightist party had previously campaigned for restoration of the death penalty, which has been dropped as part of Turkey’s accession talks with the European Union. The rightists would like to use capital punishment against Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P. K. K. In the current debate, though, it has not raised that demand, and there has been speculation that it will get a cabinet post as a reward for its support. Passions have been high throughout the sessions in Parliament, with fistfights a regular feature. The government’s own parliamentary television channel did not broadcast the sessions live, despite the importance of the debates, but many of the members posted video feeds of the melees on social media. In the session on Thursday, the violence broke out largely among female lawmakers. It began when an opposition member, Aylin Nazliaka, handcuffed herself to the microphone on the lectern as a protest. Lawmakers from the governing party then swarmed around her to remove the handcuffs, and in the ensuing struggle a crowd of women could be seen on video punching, kicking and pulling one another’s hair. During the altercation, Ms. Pavey’s prosthetic arm was dislodged, she fell and was later hospitalized. Ms. Nazliaka was separated from the microphone, and she said her hand had been injured. “They attacked all of us, blinded by anger,” Ms. Pavey said afterward. “This assault shows a sample of what they will do to us after the constitutional amendment package passes. ” The debate on the Constitution comes at a time of high tension in Turkey. Amid the crackdowns on Kurdish politicians and on followers of the exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of staging the attempted coup, there has been a series of   terrorist attacks, including one on a nightclub on New Year’s Day, killing 39 people. The governor of Istanbul, Vasip Sahin, said on Twitter that an assailant using a flame thrower on Friday attacked Istanbul’s Police Headquarters, where the authorities were holding Abdulgadir Masharipov, who was charged in the New Year’s nightclub attack and whom officials described as an Islamic State militant. The assailant also attacked the nearby A. K. P. headquarters, the governor said. No one was hurt. In addition, Turkey is coping with millions of mostly Syrian refugees, under an agreement with the European Union to prevent them from continuing to flood into Europe, in exchange for billions of euros in European Union aid. The crackdown on political opponents and the news media has led to criticism from the European Union and has greatly set back Turkey’s hopes to join the bloc. Mr. Erdogan has reacted to that criticism bitterly, threatening to break with the bloc and even restore the death penalty. Voting on the new Constitution began Friday afternoon and extended into Saturday morning. It was a lengthy process, although there was little doubt the measures would pass. Turkish voters will vote on whether to approve the document in an April referendum, which is expected to be deeply divisive.",-1.0
"Pound falls on weak UK outlook; dollar rises broadly.  Sterling declined on Monday, after the currency plunged to a   low on Friday in what has been described as a ”flash crash” event, with investors concerned Britain will make a hard exit from the European Union. The dollar firmed across the board as it continued to benefit from expectations the Federal Reserve will most likely raise interest rates in December.  Investors are looking to Wednesday’s release of minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s meeting in September to determine how close the U. S. central bank was to raising rates. Traders last saw a roughly 70 percent chance that the Fed will increase rates in December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. But the focus of the market during the U. S. Columbus Day holiday has been squarely on the British pound after the currency’s thrashing on Friday. The pound has fallen for three straight sessions. ”Investors predict further declines as hard Brexit seems increasingly inevitable,” said Paresh Davdra, chief executive  and   of Rational FX in London, an online FX service. The Bank of England’s   index, which did not price during sterling’s 10 percent   crash in Asia on Friday, hit its lowest since 2009 on continuing  worries about the impact of Britain’s exit from the European Union. In afternoon trading in New York, the pound was down 0. 64 percent against the dollar at $1. 2352  . The dollar was last up 0. 75 percent against the yen at  103. 67 yen   after touching a session high of 103. 78 yen. The dollar also rose against the euro, which was last down 0. 54 percent at $1. 1139  . These gains helped push the dollar index up 0. 29 percent to 96. 916 . DXY. The Mexican peso, which has been pressured since May by Trump’s promises to clamp down on immigration and rethink trade relations, surged to a   high against the dollar as the chances of a victory for the Republican nominee in next month’s elections seem less likely. ”The move in the peso is just a confirmation of the market’s feeling that Trump is going to lose,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York. The Mexican currency   rose more than 2 percent against the U. S. dollar, which fell to a   low of 18. 795 pesos after the second presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

"Facebook to Begin ’Fake News’ Filtering in Germany Prior to Election - Breitbart. Facebook will soon begin to roll out their “fake news” filter in Germany according to a report in the Financial Times. [The Financial Times reports that following Angela Merkel’s worries about fake news and misinformation prior to the upcoming German elections, Facebook will begin their fake news monitoring program in Germany very soon. Facebook announced their fake news fact checking program in the US in December, partnering with partisan organisations such as ABC News, Snopes, and Politifact to determine what counts as fake news.  Stories reported on Facebook’s platform as fake news will now be forwarded to Correctiv, a     news organisation. If the news is deemed to be incorrect it will be marked as “disputed” and an explanation for the judgement will be attached. These items will also appear lower on Facebook timelines as items are sorted by Facebook’s algorithm.  Speaking to the Financial Times, a Facebook spokesperson stated that the social media company was searching for other German media partners to help with fact checking. Facebook also stated that Germany was just the first of many countries that they planned to implement their fake news fact checking service in. “Our focus is on Germany right now but we’re certainly thinking through what countries will unveil next,” said the spokesperson. German politicians have called for a crackdown on fake news for some time now and specifically targeted Facebook in relation to misinformation. Justice Minister Heiko Maas said last November that Facebook should be treated as any other media company and be held responsible for the content on their platform. The German government reportedly previously considered setting up their own bureau to monitor fake news, according to German newspaper Deutsche Welle. Justice Minister Heiko Maas has previously stated that fake news was a “danger to our culture of debate” and that social media companies had a duty to curb the spreading of misinformation. “It can’t be in Facebook’s interest that its platform is misused in order to spread lies and hate campaigns,” Maas told Deutsche Welle. “Criminal content should be deleted immediately once it has been reported. And it must be easier for users to report fake news. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

"How to live to 100. Acciaroli, Italy (CNN)”Eat badly and work hard,”    Giuseppe told me when I asked him the secret to a long life.   Giuseppe was taking me to his garden, which he tends to every day, growing tomatoes, peppers, lemons, oranges and lotus fruit.   We had come to his hometown of Acciaroli, south of Naples, for a report on the amazing longevity of its inhabitants, one in ten of whom, according to Mayor Stefano Pisani, is classed as a centenarian.  The reasons put forth for their amazing longevity are many    the   ”Mediterranean diet,” regular exercise, a mild climate . ..  For his part Giuseppe laughs off all the talk about clean living, pointing out that until five years ago he smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. His prescription is somewhat more  . His secret? ”Donne,” he says    women.  He told me that after his wife died six years ago he became depressed. ”But then,” he recalls, ”I thought it’s not the end of the world. I should go on living. So I asked a donnina (’little woman’) if she would go with me, and she said yes. ”I noticed that too is indispensable,” he says. ”It makes you happy, more cheerful.” ”But does it still function?” I asked.  ”Of course!” he replied. ”Once it really worked.”  A neighbor told us Giuseppe had already gone through several caregivers because he had made too many unwanted advances.  READ MORE: The countries with the secret to long life, Just where the Mediterranean diet comes in to this was    so far, at least    something of a mystery. The diet consists of plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, a modest quantity of carbohydrates, and fish.  The next morning Elisabetta, the mayor’s assistant, took us to the home of Caterina, 81, who was going to show us how to prepare a typical meal based on the Mediterranean diet. So while she was cutting up potatoes, tomatoes and garlic to fry with olive oil, I asked her if she liked fish. She giggled, crinkling her nose.  ”No, not really. I prefer meat,” she replied. ”And ice cream too. I love sweets.” From the other room Elisabetta laughed with a hint of exasperation as this ”promotional event” for the Mediterranean diet suddenly collapsed. READ MORE: Is sitting the new smoking? The elderly inhabitants of Acciaroli and the hilly coastal areas surrounding it are the subject of a study being conducted jointly by Rome’s La Sapienza University and the University of   Diego.  Researchers are investigating 300 local centenarians, trying to understand why people here live so long, and have such low rates of heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease.  Among the things they plan to look into is whether the high concentrations of rosemary in the diet, and lots of walking through the mountains nearby have a positive impact on longevity. READ MORE: Mediterranean diet lowers heart attack, stroke risk, American nutritionist Ancel Keys (the inventor of   which kept US troops fed during World War Two) first identified what became known as the Mediterranean diet when he found in this part of Italy so many elderly and active people.  Keys lived here and studied the diet before passing away at the ripe old age of 100 in 2004.  Delia Morinelli, who is 79 herself, was Key’s cook for many years. Nowadays she runs a restaurant specializing in the Mediterranean diet.  Unlike Caterina, she is a passionate and emphatic advocate of that diet, and showed us how to prepare a healthy dish of pasta with chickpeas. In the restaurant’s kitchen, she had laid out bowls of tomatoes, onions, bay leaves, olives, sardines, zucchini, carrots, rosemary, celery, basil.  ”When I worked for Keys,” she recalls, ”we never bought meat. In this restaurant, meat doesn’t exist. And no butter, either.”  READ MORE: The island where people forget to die, The fact is, Italians have an already healthy average life span of 82 years.  Italians do like their fresh fruits and vegetables, and in my humble opinion are some of the most   people on earth. Food    where it’s bought, how it’s prepared and how it’s eaten    is a favorite topic of conversation.  The national health system here is considered one of the best in Europe.  And perhaps most importantly, Italians don’t believe in working themselves to the point of exhaustion to get ahead. READ MORE: The centenarian tide is on the rise, But it wasn’t until we met Antonio and Amina that I really got an insight into what makes people in Acciaroli live so long.  Antonio celebrated his 100th birthday last February. After a stint with the Italian Army in Ethiopia in the 1930s, he returned to Acciaroli to become a fisherman.  Back then it was a poor, remote village, without electricity or running water. People ate what they grew or caught. Life was hard: the weak died young, the strong survived.  ”I remember everything,” he says. ”I remember it as if it was yesterday.” READ MORE: Does this beach paradise hold secret to long life? Antonio wasn’t interested in talking about diet, though. The secret of his longevity, he insisted, was ”this beautiful woman, the woman of my life.” Amina, 93, smiled shyly. Spry and   she still writes poetry, and recites it easily from memory. Her favorite is a poem she dedicated to Antonio.  ”By the sea, the waves put my soul at rest”I saw a little boat approach, a fisherman laying nets”When he got closer, I looked at him and he smiled at me”He invited me on board for a ride, it was a pleasure trip”I saw seagulls flying around, fighting with the other fishermen”I was taken by the beauty of the sea, and I became the bride of the fisherman.” As she spoke the final line, she reached out and caressed Antonio’s chin.

" Republicans Want The EPA To Investigate Employees Using Encryption.  Two Republicans in Congress called Tuesday for the EPA’s Inspector General to investigate the use of encrypted messages by agency officials. Citing news reports, the letter from Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas and Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois, charges that federal workers have turned to encryption software to hide their communications ahead of the arrival of Trump administration appointees, such as incoming EPA chief Scott Pruitt. The letter charges that unnamed EPA officials will use these encrypted communications to “discuss potential strategies against any attempts by   political officials to redirect the EPA’s priorities in ways that depart from initiatives spearheaded by Obama Administration appointees. ” Smith heads Congress’s science committee and LaHood chairs the oversight subcommittee of that body. Smith held a hearing last week on changing science committees at EPA to admit more industry scientists, and disqualify academic ones funded by the agency, to advisory roles. Jennifer Kaplan of the EPA’s Office of Inspector General confirmed to BuzzFeed News that her office had received the science committee request. The inspector general will make an independent decision on whether to investigate, she added. In December, the EPA’s inspector general had released a report saying that agency employees must take better steps to preserve instant messages, subject to the Federal Records Act. Andrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists told BuzzFeed News that “there is some irony” that Smith, who has subpoenaed email from scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and demanded records from other agencies, is “suddenly being alarmed about people being careful with their communications. ” In a separate letter sent Tuesday, Smith called for NOAA to send him “documents and communications” from scientists related to a 2015 climate study. Smith cited “allegations of politicization” in the study. “Of course, people have to comply with the Federal Records Act,” Rosenberg said. “But Smith has himself created a situation where they might be worried about their email being targeted because of his past witch hunts. ” Hundreds of current and former EPA employees have protested the appointment of Pruitt, who as attorney general of Oklahoma spearheaded a   lawsuit against the agency’s Clean Power Plan, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, as well as other EPA pollution measures. More than 400 former EPA officials have signed a letter released earlier this month complaining that Pruitt, “has shown no interest in enforcing environmental laws. ” One former EPA official, Eric Schaeffer of the Environmental Integrity Project, told BuzzFeed News that Pruitt, the incoming EPA chief, has his own email problem: “The 3, 000 emails and other documents showing communication between Scott Pruitt and Americans for Prosperity (aka the Koch Brothers) Devon Energy, and other energy companies aren’t encrypted. Mr. Pruitt has yet to provide them in response to a 25 month old Open Records request,” said Schaeffer, by email. “The good news is Lamar Smith can get them any time he wants and share them with the public. And call a hearing if those documents show that on environmental issues, Scott Pruitt and the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office are just a front for the oil lobby. ” 			This story has been updated to include acknowledgement of receipt of the science committee letter from the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.			 			The science committee’s letter requested investigation of encryption applications. An earlier headline of this story misstated the materials under investigation.			  ",-1.0
"Pennsylvania’s ex-attorney general sentenced to jail for grand jury leak. The first Democrat and first woman to serve as Pennsylvania attorney general was sentenced to jail on Monday, completing a catastrophic fall from grace for a rising political star.  Former Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane, once seen as a potential future governor, was convicted in August of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She resigned from her position two days later, having served since 2013. Kane was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in jail and eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane’s ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law. If Kane posts bond of $75, 000 cash bail, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction. The jury at her criminal trial in August found her guilty of illegally leaking grand jury findings to the press to embarrass a political enemy. She then plotted a   and lied about it under oath. Kane, 50, was convicted of two felony counts and seven misdemeanors in her perjury trial. She resigned from her position two days later, having served since 2013. Looking back at her swift downfall, Bruce Ledewitz, a law professor at Pittsburgh’s Duquesne University said: “This illustrates once more, if anyone ever needed reminding, that the   is worse than the crime. ” Kane could initially have gotten away with a slap on the wrist for the leak itself, he told the Guardian. “The grand jury leak would have been a minor embarrassment if she had gone to court and apologized. But instead she started covering up,” he said. Kane’s short reign was one of paradox. She became known for standing up for victims of sexual violence and defending gay rights. And she took on a state criminal justice establishment she called the “old boys’ club” including a crackdown after racist, sexist and pornographic emails were discovered being swapped on government computers. But she also developed a reputation for grandiosity,   and   some observers noted. “Her fall has been shocking. There was nothing on her track record to suggest that she was going to become corrupted by power. She came into that office as Bambi and turned into Richard Nixon overnight  —   seeking to get even with political foe,” Ledewitz said. Judge Wendy   said during sentencing that Kane assumed an “off with your heads” mentality as she ran the state’s top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political “neophyte” who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office. “This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant . .. felt had embarrassed her in the press,”   said. Kane campaigned for office pledging to investigate whether Republicans were dragging out the slow process of indicting Jerry Sandusky, for political reasons. The former Penn State football coach was eventually convicted in 2012, found guilty of 45 counts of abusing young boys after a long grand jury probe had found crimes going back decades. No politically motivated delays in the case were ever proved, but Kane became embroiled in feuds with Republican governor Tom Corbett, Sandusky prosecutor Frank Fina and others. Fina ended up being the main target of the leak that sunk Kane. Over a relatively short period, her leadership became marred by vendettas, lawsuits and leaks.   attorney Walter Cohen, a former attorney general, said Kane’s motives were often just but her execution was   and her style became grandiose. “She started to believe all the great things people were saying about her and believed she was indestructible,” Cohen said. Kane came under investigation in 2014. But even as the perjury case was closing in on her, her team was working hard behind the scenes on a secret grand jury investigation into pedophile priests. In the spring of 2016, Kane released a report exposing decades of “monstrous” child abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the Pennsylvania archdiocese of  . A series of other Pennsylvania archdioceses are now similarly under investigation. Meanwhile Kane encouraged state lawmakers’ attempts to lift the statute of limitations so that more victims of child abuse could sue the church, despite those efforts being repeatedly thwarted by pushback from Catholic leaders. In 2015, Kane’s law license was suspended and she was charged by Montgomery County district attorney Kevin Steele, the same prosecutor who indicted Bill Cosby for sexual assault. Ironically, with her trial looming in 2016, Kane hired a Republican prosecutor, Bruce Castor, to, essentially, stand in for her. He was best known for declining to prosecute Bill Cosby a decade ago and was perceived by some as acting against the interests of victims of sexual violence. Castor left shortly after Kane’s conviction. A new attorney general will be elected in November. The race, reportedly, has been lacking in drama. “That’s not a bad thing,” Ledewitz said.

"New RNC ad attacking Kaine sparks controversy.  (CNN) Republicans are facing scrutiny for launching a new web advertisement attacking Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine that recalls the infamous 1988 Willie Horton attack ad on Democrat Michael Dukakis.  Just one day before he takes on Republican Mike Pence in the vice presidential debate, a new web ad from the GOP, ”America Deserves Better,” highlights Kaine’s complicated relationship with capital punishment. The infamous 1988 Horton television ad attacked Dukakis’ furlough policy, but drew widespread scrutiny for its racial undertones. An exclusive story from Roll Call when the RNC ad was first released Monday morning described the ad as ”Willie  .”  Republican Party chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer tweeted a link to the Roll Call story with the headline comparing the RNC ad to the Horton ad. The GOP account also tweeted the link. Both have since been deleted after Spicer’s tweet of the Roll Call story headline triggered an outpouring of criticism.  Kristine Viesselman, Roll Call’s    issued a statement defending their headline. ”Like the Horton ad, the new ad specifically criticizes the candidate (Kaine) for his perceived weakness in dealing with criminals. Our story makes no reference to race,” she said in a statement. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted, ”When the RNC is forced to delete its own tweets promoting an ad, that tells you everything you need to know about how shameful the attack is.” The RNC ad itself highlights four criminals, three white men and one black man.  ”Long before Tim Kaine was in office, he consistently protected the worst kinds of people,” a narrator says over black and white images of Hillary Clinton’s running mate.  RELATED: How to watch the vice presidential debate on CNN, The ad mentions two death penalty cases Kaine defended as an attorney, Richard Lee Whiteley and Lem Tuggle, his commutation of the death sentence of Percy Walton as governor, and his 2010 decision to support the extradition of Jens Soering, a German man convicted of double murder. Spicer told CNN’s Chris Cuomo Tuesday that the ad is not similar to the controversial Horton ad. ”Anyone who compares it to the Willie Horton ad either hasn’t seen the ad or doesn’t understand history,” he said on ”New Day.” ”As you pointed out, the folks in the ad    three of the four are white.” ”Tim Kaine had previously said someone should be judged by the totality of their record,” Spicer added. ”This is the Tim Kaine part of the record that they don’t want to discuss.”  Kaine, a devout Catholic, has a   opposition to capital punishment. But when he was running for governor in Virginia, he vowed to enforce the death penalty.  ”I’m against the death penalty, I don’t think we need it,” Kaine said in a June interview with   before he was chosen as Clinton’s running mate. ”The law in Virginia is that the death penalty can be the ultimate punishment for the most serious crimes . .. and I really grappled with, I’m against the death penalty, but I’m going to take an oath to uphold the law.”  But Spicer Tuesday said the ad is not about Kaine’s religious convictions.  ”It’s not just about the death penalty. It’s about making sure they served the least amount of time possible. That’s a big difference,” he told Cuomo. ”He went out and defended people who committed heinous crimes, and he sought to get the lowest penalty for them.” ”That’s fine. He chose to do that. But he should be judged for it as well,” Spicer said.  Eleven people were executed during his tenure as governor.  He faces off with Pence Tuesday evening. ",-1.0
"Sanders’ campaign is over, yet Secret Service remains . Washington (CNN) Bernie Sanders is back to his old day job, trading the booming applause of his campaign rallies to the far more tedious work of the Senate. ”I have a parliamentary inquiry!” Sanders shouted on the Senate floor one night last week, testing the patience of his colleagues, who were eager to leave the Capitol and start their holiday break. But just off the Senate floor and across the Capitol, one vestige of his presidential campaign remains: his Secret Service detail. And taxpayers are footing the bill. Protecting a presidential candidate costs about $40, 000 a day, a federal official familiar with the Homeland Security budget told CNN. For Sanders, that’s more than a   dollars since the last primary on June 14. The cost could grow by nearly $2 million if he stays in the race through the Democratic convention in Philadelphia later.  The federal official said it’s difficult to tally exact costs, since some agents are working on other projects simultaneously, but the overall amount spent on Sanders is far higher when calculating the weeks of protection he received after the nomination was effectively out of his reach, as Hillary Clinton surpassed him in the delegate count. Sanders waved off questions on the matter. RELATED: Bernie Sanders: ’No, I do not hate Secretary Clinton’ ”I think security is probably something we shouldn’t be talking about too much,” Sanders told CNN last week, walking with his protective detail through the halls of the Senate office buildings. But many of his fellow senators are talking about it. Several told CNN privately they were stunned to see Sanders at the Capitol with such an entourage, particularly because the building is already secured by U. S. Capitol Police. One colleague, who declined to be identified to avoid publicly talking ill of a fellow senator, bluntly said: ”Bernie’s on an ego kick.” The Secret Service is also stretched thin, preparing for two additional   protectees as both parties are preparing to announce their vice presidential candidates in July.  A spokesman for Sanders declined to discuss why the senator has not relinquished his Secret Service protection and his    coverage in Washington, at home in Vermont or wherever he goes. RELATED: Biden says Sanders will endorse Clinton, Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that active presidential candidates should be protected. He stopped short of sharply criticizing Sanders, but said he hoped it would be resolved soon. ”At some point in time, hopefully Senator Sanders will realize he’s not going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and Secret Service protection can be removed,” Johnson,   said. Asked whether it was a wise use of taxpayer money, Johnson said: ”That’s going to be up to Sen. Sanders.” RELATED: Public vetting of Tim Kaine begins ahead of Clinton VP decision, Sanders started receiving Secret Service coverage in February, between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, as his candidacy soared and his crowds swelled. He had several close calls with protestors along the way, where his agents rushed in to protect him from potential harm.  A spokeswoman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the duration or cost of Sanders’ protection. Department guidelines say a candidate loses coverage when he or she formally drops out of the race or suspend their campaign. Unless Sanders does that, his armed detail will likely surround him until Clinton is formally nominated at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in late July.  Sanders has acknowledged he won’t be the nominee and has said he will likely vote for Clinton, but advisers say he is keeping his candidacy alive to influence the party platform at the convention. The Secret Service is stretched particularly thin during a presidential campaign and Sanders’ decision not to suspend his campaign has raised some eyebrows inside the agency. Many believe his coverage would end after the District of Columbia primary ended the voting season June 14. ”We protect candidates and I don’t really think he can be defined as a candidate at this point,” said a person involved in Secret Service protection, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that Sanders’ decision seemed ”unprecedented.”  RELATED: A witness to history: 50 years of presidential politics, On Capitol Hill, Sanders’ small motorcade turned heads last week, particularly when many    senators drive themselves or hop into the front seat of an aide’s car after votes are finished for the night. Only congressional leaders receive a protective detail and transportation. Several Democratic senators told CNN they didn’t feel comfortable discussing Sanders’ security. But politically speaking, they said it was time for Sanders to step aside.  ”I love Bernie. He’s a good senator and he has certainly contributed in this presidential campaign,” said Sen. Bill Nelson,  . ”But it is now time for him to stand down.” ",-1.0
"Jeff Sessions: Russia allegation ""false"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the Russian ambassador to the US, the Washington Post reports, though he later said he had no ""contact with the Russians"". The Sessions response: Sessions was asked during a confirmation hearing earlier this year about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. He said at the time that he did not have ""communications with the Russians,"" and claimed he wasn't aware of any contacts. The then-senator met once with Sergey Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee, and once after an event. He is already under pressure to step aside and appoint a special prosecutor for ongoing Russia-related investigations. For context, Michael Flynn resigned after misleading the White House about conversations with Kislyak.",0.0
"’Monsieur Mayonnaise’: The Sandwich King Who Saved Jewish Children From Nazis . There’s enough material in the life of Philippe Mora to warrant not just one movie, but maybe three or four. His career as the director of more than 40 films, for instance, including the Dennis Hopper outlaw flick Mad Dog Morgan. His prolific history as a visual artist  —   including the time the stench from his   statue raised the hackles of Princess Margaret. His relationship with legendary French mime Marcel Marceau, who also happened to be his godfather, or with the    musician Eric Clapton, who also happened to be his roommate. But it is Mora’s origins  —   complete with his dazzlingly kooky family  —   that take center stage in Monsieur Mayonnaise, the documentary from director Trevor Graham that premiered in February at the Berlinale Film Festival. And its star may not even be Mora himself, but a   baguette, slathered in mayonnaise. Graham’s film reaches way back into Mora family history to tell the story of Philippe’s mother, a visual artist born in France to Lithuanian Jewish   immigrants, and his father, a German Jewish member of the French Resistance, both of whom later became prominent figures in the Melbourne arts scene. Mayonnaise depicts the Moras’ years in hiding and their efforts to resist the forces of   European fascism. If that sounds like a recipe for tragedy, take heart. Graham tells the Moras’ story just as the Moras themselves would: vividly, optimistically and with unflagging good humor. And a love of food and art delivers this family, and the film, out of the recesses of despair. ”All kids want to know what their parents don’t want them to know,” Mora said after the premiere in Berlin, part of the Berlinale’s annual Culinary Cinema series. He described growing up in a ”historically sanitized” environment, in a family that maintained a certain joie de vivre and declined to dwell on  —   or even discuss  —   their experiences during World War II. The desire to look deeper into his family’s past, Mora said, sprung from his interest in finding answers  —   both about his own family history, and about the atrocities committed under the Third Reich. ”I don’t know whether the answers exist or not, but you’ve got to ask the question,” Mora said later in an interview with NPR. Mora’s friendship with Graham blossomed, as many   friendships do, over Facebook. (And in true   terms, they describe theirs as a ”bromance. ”) Mora had begun to investigate his family history, fearful of missing the opportunity to speak with some of its aging major players, and he posted his findings publicly. Graham’s interest was piqued, and he reached out to Mora about making a film. In Mayonnaise, we meet Mora in the depths of his research, documenting in a comic book the family stories he unearths. The     saga comes together in a collage of archival footage,   interviews with Mora and his mother, Mirka, and   panels   by Mora himself. From his family, Mora absorbed the message that the film delivers so affably to its audience: ”Love the good things in life . .. like art and mayonnaise.” And oh, the mayonnaise! Hellmann’s this is not: Deeply,   yellow, the beloved Mora condiment gets whisked up onscreen by Mirka herself  —   with great enthusiasm, and in seemingly industrial quantity. Mora knew that his father, Georges, who died in 1992, had earned the curious nickname ”Monsieur Mayonnaise” during the war. But it wasn’t until he was an adult that he learned why  —   from none other than Marcel Marceau himself. Mayonnaise, it turns out, was the key ingredient in a cunning little trick Georges devised to save the lives of Jewish children: Georges slipped resistance documents and passports (wrapped in wax paper) into baguette sandwiches and slathered them with mayonnaise. The Gestapo, he reasoned, wouldn’t inspect the sandwiches too closely  —   they wouldn’t want to get mayo on their gloved fingers. Graham, who also hails from Australia, is a veteran of the Berlinale and of culinary cinema. His last entry in the festival, 2013’s Make Hummus Not War, examined the   conflict through the lens of the popular chickpea paste, of which both nations claim ownership. Mora, too, has made something of a career chewing over the same themes that emerge in Mayonnaise. At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, Mora’s documentary Swastika provoked one of the most violent responses in Cannes history. Appalled that Mora had humanized Adolf Hitler  —   the film features home footage of the Führer playing with children and discussing Gone With the Wind with Eva Braun  —   audience members began to shout and throw things at the screen. According to Mora, the ruckus became so heated that a member of Cannes personnel had to yell into the agitated crowd, ”Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Cannes film festival, not a beer hall.” Mayonnaise’s premiere in Berlin transpired far more peaceably. A   dinner orchestrated by   chef Christian Lohse  —   with the title ”Mayonnaise Oils the Intelligence”  —   followed the screening in Berlin’s   Gropius Mirror Restaurant. The atmosphere was jovial, and both Mora and Graham reviewed Lohse’s (rather white) mayonnaise favorably. But during the dessert course, when the duo fielded a question about the historic parallels between the Europe of Mayonnaise and that of today, the room fell silent. The same question ”came up the very first screening we had [in Australia],” Graham said over a glass of wine the following evening, in a joint interview with Mora. ”There were 700 people, and someone right at the back said, ’Did you make this film deliberately with contemporary events, events about refugees in mind?’ I said, ’No, but yes.’ ” ”That’s a tricky answer,” Mora said wryly. ”I know. But that’s the reality,” Graham continued. ”What I wanted was for those sorts of things to resonate, but not to be sticking up a placard that’s saying, ’This is what the film is about.’ The film is about Philippe’s family story and what they experienced.” For his part, Mora responded to the question with a quote from Mark Twain. ”History doesn’t repeat itself,” Mora said, ”but it rhymes.” Morgan Childs is a freelance journalist based in Prague.

"Fed Chair Yellen has a mini revolt on her hands as dissenters emerge. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has something of a mini revolt on her hands. Four of the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee have now publicly indicated their disagreement with the dovish guidance in last week's policy statement and in comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen at her press conference. The latest dissenter is Patrick Harker, the new president of the Philadelphia Fed, who said in a speech Tuesday night that the Fed should ""get on with"" rate hikes and consider another move in April. He joins centrists John Williams of San Francisco and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta who earlier this week said the Fed should consider an April hike. Esther George, the Kansas City Fed president who is thought to be among the more hawkish Fed members, dissented at the meeting last week and called for a 25 basis point hike. Only one of the four dissenters is a voter this year, suggesting that Yellen has the votes she needs if she wants to keep rates unchanged at the April meeting. But their viewpoints raise questions about just how secure those votes are and whether other hawkish members of the FOMC, for example Loretta Mester of Cleveland, or even Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, could be leaning toward a hike next month. They also present something of a public challenge to Yellen's leadership. While Yellen said at her press conference that April, like all meetings, was a live meeting, she otherwise indicated she was wary of rate hikes in the near future. ""Proceeding cautiously in removing policy accommodation at this time will allow us to verify that the labor market is continuing to strengthen despite the risks from abroad,"" Yellen said. ""Such caution is appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook."" In its policy statement, the Fed raised its level of concern over global economic weakness and declined to say whether the risks were balanced toward stronger or weaker economic growth. Some observers believe the Fed needs to asses the risks as balanced before it will hike again. In addition, the average number of rate hikes forecast this year by FOMC members declined to just two from four. The combination of the statements, Yellen's press conference and changes to the rate outlook led markets to price in a rate hike only as soon as September, where it previously had pegged June.

"Obama’s Ethnic Divide-and-Conquer Strategy. ‘The Owl of Minerva spreads its wings only at dusk. ” So Hegel reminded us that we fully grasp something only as it approaches its conclusion. And so it is with President Obama’s project to fundamentally transform the country by, among other things, perpetuating ethnic divisions. This final State of the Union marks the beginning of the end of his administration. It’s a good time to ask: Is the project succeeding? What it was, simply put, was important   training in how to stoke dissatisfaction and spread activism across the country, one community at a time. Practiced on a national scale  —   and combined with a liberal academic’s understanding of Critical Theory’s plan to replace the values of the “dominant group” with the “ ” of “subordinate groups”  —   the project meant ensuring that different ethnic groups became politically active while remaining unassimilated. The fact that the president doubled down on his celebration of “diversity” in his speech last night made it clear that he’s not abandoning this narrative in the twilight year of his administration, a race to the end that promises even more damage. In a new report, I argue that to embark on this debate, we need to understand how America did things in the past  —   how it assimilated multiple ethnicities into a single people who brimmed with an exuberance of patriotic spirit as they threw themselves into their shared destiny. We must also understand what we are doing now by officially dividing the nation into five different groups  —   Whites, African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians  —   and encouraging their permanence with benefits such as racial preferences. That the first is the “dominant group” of Critical Theory, and the last four are the “subordinate groups,” as can be seen in the perfectly Orwellian “all animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others” language of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It helpfully explains that: Every U. S. citizen is a member of some protected class, and is entitled to the benefits of EEO law. However, the EEO laws were passed to correct a history of unfa vorable treatment of women and minority group members. Two minority groups  —   Hispanics and Asians  —   are made up mostly of immigrants. Designating them as beneficiaries of remedies for a “history” of discrimination would seem suspect if the purpose really were as stated. But in this case the true purpose is to encourage people to culturally segregate. What this approach may do to the survivability of constitutional, representative government is of some import. To quote John Stuart Mill (who, unlike that other   philosopher Hegel, did think long and hard on the matter): “free institutions are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities. ” “Among a people without   especially if they read and speak different languages, the united public opinion, necessary to the working of representative government, cannot exist,” Mill wrote in his 1861 classic Considerations on Representative Government. It’s not that complicated: A portion of mankind may be said to constitute a Nationality if they are united by common sympathies which do not exist between them and other others  —   which make them cooperate with each other more willingly than with other people. President Obama, of course, did not create what has been called “the ethnoracial pentagon,” but he has made plentiful use of it. This is, after all, the president who told Univision in 2010 that Hispanics voters must “punish our enemies” and “reward our friends who stand with us. ” The strategy plan of his Task Force on New Americans  —   announced in late 2014, right after his executive action on amnesty  —   leaves out such words or phrases as “assimilation,” “patriotism,” “Americanization,” and “E Pluribus Unum. ” It is, however, replete with calls for celebrating and preserving “diverse linguistic and cultural assets” as well as “diverse cultural practices. ” It stresses that we must have “  and   learning” so as “to maintain   proficiency to preserve culture. ” Meanwhile, it says, becoming a citizen should be made easier, and activism encouraged. Last night, Obama showed again that he misunderstands not just the world, but also his own country as it has been till now, when he said, “The world respects us not just for our arsenal it respects us for our diversity. ” No, the world used to respect an America that was the champion of the representative government Mill espoused. Two of Obama’s predecessors, Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower, saw where this trend was headed. As early as 1966, while gearing up to run for governor of California, the Gipper pegged it as nothing other than an attempt by the Left to divide the country, the better to transform it. Ike suggested to Reagan that he put it this way at his first major press conference: In this campaign I’ve been presenting to the pub lic some of the things I want to do for California  —   meaning for all the people of our State. I do not exclude any citizen from my concern and I make no distinctions among them on such invalid bases as color or creed. Reagan responded: I am in complete agreement about dropping the hyphen that presently divides us into minority groups. I’m convinced this “hyphenating” was done by our opponents to create voting blocs for political expediency. After seven long years, knowing what we know, those who vie to take up the Gipper’s and Ike’s mantle should also take up this debate.,",1.0
"Science Isn’t Partisan, But Public Perception Of Science Often Is. Last Saturday, tens of thousands of people across the country joined the March for Science, an event that the official website described as ”the first step of a global movement to defend the vital role science plays in our health, safety, economies, and governments.” It’s no secret that the event was largely prompted by Donald Trump’s actions and proposed policies, many of which threaten efforts to curtail climate change and ignore the value of scientific research and   policy. But advocates for the march were generally careful to separate science from partisan politics. As one headline declared: ”The March for Science isn’t partisan or    —   it’s  .” Whether or not science is partisan or political, the perception of science often is. Beliefs about many scientific issues, such as human evolution and anthropogenic climate change, correlate with political ideology and party affiliation. There are also associations between political orientation and more general attitudes toward science and scientists. For instance, when it comes to assessing the possible risks and benefits of science and technology, liberals place greater trust in university scientists than conservatives do. A new study, forthcoming in the journal Public Understanding of Science, contributes to a growing body of psychological research uncovering the mechanisms by which politics and ideology influence people’s perceptions of scientists and scientific claims. The key insight is that science isn’t understood in isolation, disconnected from other beliefs, values and emotions. Instead, science is assimilated within a web of existing attitudes and beliefs, a core part of which concerns a person’s social identity. Consider a vegan who encounters a study supporting positive environmental and nutritional consequences from following a   diet. Consider a video game aficionado who reads a news story reporting a link between playing video games and aggressive behavior. In the former case, the scientific findings affirm an identity that our hypothetical vegan holds dear: Veganism is great! In the second case, the finding is disconcerting  —   it potentially threatens our hypothetical reader’s identity as a gamer. The dissonance between a person’s identity and the implications of scientific claims can be uncomfortable, prompting some sort of change to either the person’s identity or their acceptance of the relevant science. If the identity is highly valued and entrenched, it’s the science that’s more likely to go. Indeed, prior work finds that when a scientific result threatens a person’s strongly held identity, they’re more likely to question the science and methods involved and to become more rather than less certain of their views. The forthcoming study, authored by Peter Nauroth and colleagues, goes one step further in testing whether scientific findings that threaten a person’s identity lead not only to greater rejection of the science, but to a shift in the person’s perception of the scientist who conducted the research. And indeed, they find this is so: Participants who read about a scientific study that posed a threat to their identity rated the scientist who conducted the study significantly less competent and reputable than did participants in a control condition. The study also found that a threat to identity influenced participants’ perception of scientific consensus: Participants who read about a scientific claim that threatened their identity were less likely to think that the claim represented the predominant opinion in the scientific community. The new study, which reports data from 138 German university students, departs from most prior research on laypeople’s perceptions of science in using social identities that were experimentally induced in the lab. Participants first completed a task that identified them as having a ”holistic association style” as opposed to a ”detailed association style,” and the scientific research they went on to read suggested that associate style was or was not predictive of prosocial behavior. In the condition designed to threaten social identity, for example, they read that those with a holistic association style were found to be less prosocial than those with a detailed association style. That these novel and somewhat arbitrary identities had consequences for how participants evaluated the subsequently presented science suggests that   identities  —   which are typically more meaningful and entrenched  —   could have even larger effects. For instance, a study concluding that conservatives are more easily disgusted than liberals, or that people who follow Democrats on Twitter are more likely than those who follow Republicans to use swear words in their tweets, could be evaluated quite differently by readers on different sides of the political aisle. This could lead them to draw different inferences about the quality of the research, the competence of the researchers and the level of consensus in the scientific community. Fortunately, most of the research that informs policy isn’t about social identity. Studies of energy use and environmental impacts, for example, are unlikely to compare conservatives versus liberals. Studies of educational or health outcomes rarely focus on differences across Democrats and Republicans. Yet scientific claims that become associated with political positions  —   like anthropogenic climate change  —   can also become threats to political identity. And that broadens the scope of cases for which partisan politics can skew the perception of science. Tania Lombrozo is a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

"Wall Street donors going for Clinton over Trump.  Hillary Clinton is consolidating her support among Wall Street donors and other businesses ahead of a   battle with Donald Trump, winning more campaign contributions from   executives in the most recent fundraising period than all other candidates combined. The Democratic   has raised $4. 2 million in total from Wall Street, $344, 000 of which was contributed in March alone. According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of fundraising data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, the former secretary of state received 53 percent of the donations from Wall Street in March, up from 32 percent last year and 33 percent in January through February, as the nominating contests began. The analysis of   reports shows that some Wall Street donors have shifted their financial support from Republican candidates who dropped out of the race, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to Clinton in recent months. Trump, by contrast, hasn’t garnered more than 1 percent of Wall Street contributions in any month through March. To be sure, it is still early in the general election money race, and Trump hasn’t aggressively pursued the finance sector for funds so far. He   about   of his primary campaign and said last week that he planned to more actively solicit donations for the general election in order to keep pace with Clinton.

"BADBADNOTGOOD. BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol’ Dirty Bastard, eventually catching the attention of Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator. The masses took notice in 2015 when the group produced an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Soul. BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a   ensemble, but its foundation is clearly jazz, which provides a gateway to countless genres. On IV, the group allows that gateway to widen, adding soul and funk to the repertoire. Still only in their 20s, the band’s members never seemed intimidated by the intimate nature of the Tiny Desk if anything, it accentuated their enthusiasm. This was their zone. They played three selections from IV  —   including ”Cashmere,” which only slightly veered from the studio version, and ”In Your Eyes,” which features Charlotte Day Wilson’s vocals. The tight arrangement allowed Wilson to hover gently above the instrumentation, showing off the band’s most promising work to date. It was a pleasure to have BADBADNOTGOOD at the desk for IV  —   and exciting to imagine what’s in store for V, VI and beyond. IV is available now.

"Review: Dave Cobb’s ’Southern Family’ Compilation. Note: NPR’s First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the page. The finest country songwriters understand that the best way to a big idea is often through a small detail. Consider the central gesture that dictates the action in Brandy Clark’s beautiful song ”I Cried,” which appears on producer Dave Cobb’s graceful compilation album Southern Family. Contemplating a grandfather’s death and his wife’s ensuing loneliness, Clark builds the song’s chorus around the phrase, ”I cried,” her voice arching up into a tender, transcendent falsetto in the next line, she takes the mood down again. ”I tried to hold my head high, it ended up in my hands.” That simple image so effectively captures the experience of living with grief: the attempt to show strength for others, for your own sanity, and the gradual, quiet, repetitive sag into vulnerability. Who hasn’t experienced this moment at a funeral  —   or, as Clark describes, while simply talking on the phone with a fellow loved one left behind? There’s no need for an angel’s trumpets here. ”I Cried” says more about mortality with a sigh. Southern Family collects such moments in a bouquet of memories and treasured sentiments, in the process coalescing into one of the subtlest concept albums to ever bear that dangerously pretentious descriptor. Inspired by the 1979 album White Mansions, a song cycle about the Civil War spearheaded by the writer Paul Kennerly and produced by Glyn Johns, Cobb’s own effort doesn’t adhere to a linear narrative the way its predecessor does. It’s more like the way we tell tales now, in dialogue across social media, our individual experiences adding up to a collective portrait of our times. Mainstream country stars and Americana favorites show why those separate categories are increasingly meaningless  —   at least in Cobb’s world, where a strong composition and an unfussy live arrangement always get to the core of things. Miranda Lambert’s hymnlike ”Sweet Bye And Bye” complements Jason Isbell’s righteous ”God Is A Working Man” (a great campaign song for the right candidate, by the way). ”Mama’s Table,” a perfect ballad Jamey Johnson originally wrote for the Oak Ridge Boys and himself sings here, gets an answer from Zac Brown in ”Grandma’s Garden.” John Paul White offers his own funeral confession in the heartrending ”Simple Song 1,” while Anderson East confronts another life passage  —   parents’ divorce  —   in ”Learning.” Alongside offerings by Holly Williams, Morgane and Chris Stapleton, Shooter Jennings, the excellent newcomer Brent Cobb (cousin of Dave) and Rich Robinson (who brings gospel into the mix via the Settles Connection chorus in the grand closer ”The Way Home”) these songs ground place and community in the experience of the everyday: a kid’s bottle of Cheerwine, a brother’s initials carved in Grandma’s table, an old song that means something different when you sing it in nursery school and, later, to your own child. Hotly anticipated as Dave Cobb’s grand statement about the generation of mostly Southern artists who, with his help, are shifting the definitions of both country and Americana music, this collection succeeds by being as modest as its helmsman. ”Southern” and ”family” are both fraught terms  —   as are ”country” and ”Americana”  —   but instead of trying to clearly define them, Cobb (who plays guitar in nearly every track) encouraged his collaborators to approach them gently. The 12 resulting songs reflect family structures that are in flux but which endure because of love and memory, in a South constructed at backyard parties and in mothers’ kitchens more than in any legislature or historical site. Southern Family also reflects the eclecticism of the music that’s long emanated from Nashville and its environs. Clark’s track, enhanced by pedal steel and Mellotron, is high countrypolitan class East’s has the Muscle Shoals swagger he’s made his trademark. Lambert invokes the Southern gospel her song title recalls. Brent Cobb gets swampy in the comical ”Down Home,” while White finds the place where folk music meets The Beatles. Bluegrass and blues and righteous Southern rock all find a place here. More than anything else, Southern Family is an argument for tradition as an organic concept, not an imposed one. Family is in the details, and to capture those details we have to listen to each other and accept the joy, the pain and the differences.",-0.5
"Mormon Church Will Withdraw From Boy Scouts’ Programs For Older Teens. The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints has announced that as of next year, it will no longer participate in the Boy Scouts’ programs for older teenagers. The church, which has at times expressed dissatisfaction with the Scouts’ growing acceptance of LGBT leaders as well as transgender boys, will be withdrawing from formal involvement in programs geared toward youths ages 14 and older. ”We express sincere appreciation and gratitude to all adult leaders who have supported young men in these programs and are grateful for our   and continuing partnership with the Boy Scouts of America and Scouts Canada,” the First Presidency, the church’s highest governing body, told church leaders in an open letter Thursday. Yet, as the church explains in an accompanying FAQ, ”young men ages 14 to 18 are not being served well by the Varsity or Venturing programs, which have historically been difficult to implement within the Church.” Those programs specifically promise ”adventure” and activities designed to appeal to older teens. Members of the Mormon Church, which has had a formal relationship with the Boy Scouts of America for more than a century, have evinced some displeasure with the organization’s admittance of openly gay leaders and transgender boys in recent years, In its announcement materials, the church addressed these changes but specifically did not attribute its decision to them: ”The BSA has always allowed the Church to operate its programs in ways that are consistent with our standards and beliefs, and they have been very supportive. This change is to address the needs of young men ages 14 to 18. The Church is always evaluating what is best for our youth and families, and will continue to do so.” In a statement emailed to NPR, the Boy Scouts expressed appreciation for its   relationship with the church, which was ”the first partner to sponsor Scouting in the U. S.” and  —   as NPR’s Howard Berkes notes  —   remains the country’s single largest sponsor of Boy Scout troops. ”Although thousands of youth and leaders who participate in Venturing crews nationwide embrace and support the program, we recognize that not all programs are a perfect fit for all partners,” the Boy Scouts’ statement reads. ”We anticipate that many youth from the LDS Church will continue to participate in Scouting beyond the age of 14 as young men work to earn the Eagle Scout rank,” it continues. ”The BSA values our ongoing partnership with the LDS Church in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts programming and look forward to our continued efforts to extend the benefits of Scouting to as many youth and families as possible.” More than 300, 000 Mormon boys participate in the Scouts, and many older teenagers may continue to do so. The church’s decision to end its formal involvement is not by any stretch a ban, and the church will continue to charter Scouting programs for younger boys. Still, the move marks a significant shift for a church that has long been interwoven with the youth institution  —   so interwoven that The Associated Press reports the decision could mean that between 130, 000 and 180, 000 teenagers will leave the organization. ”Basically,” Brigham Young University associate professor Quin Monson, a Mormon himself, told NPR’s Rachel Martin in 2015, ”if you are a young Mormon male, you join the Boy Scouts.”",-0.5
"90 Jihadis Walked into France As ’Migrants’, Are Hiding in Paris Says Woman Who Caught Paris Terror Ringleader - Breitbart. The woman who led the French authorities to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind behind last November’s terrorist atrocity in Paris, has said that 90 jihadis who posed as migrants are currently in Paris. Despite foiling further attacks including a planned attack on a that nursery, she says she has been abandoned by the state and forced to move from hotel to hotel to avoid reprisals. [In desperation, the    known only by the pseudonym ‘Sonia’ has now spoken to BFM TV about the events of that day in the aftermath of the attack, and about her life since handing over the terrorist ringleader. She has revealed that at least 90 more jihadis from Syria are among the migrants who have entered France in the last year.  On the 15th November, two days after the attack which claimed the lives of 130 Parisians, Sonia was with her lifelong friend Hasna Ait Boulahcen, Abaaoud’s cousin, when Boulahcen received a call on her mobile phone. She was instructed to go to 2 Rue des Bergeries in Aubervilliers, in    and pick up someone who was in need of accommodation. The address turned out to be an isolated industrial estate, where from behind a bush, out stepped Abaaoud. Until this point Sonia, along with the rest of France, assumed that he had already fled to Syria. “He was smiling, he didn’t look at all like a terrorist,” said Sonia. She asked him: “Did you take part in what happened on November 13?” “He said, just like that: ‘The terraces, that was me’,” an apparent reference to the attacks on people sitting outside restaurants in central Paris. “I said: ‘But you killed people, you killed innocent people’,” said Sonia. “He said: ‘No they’re not innocent. You must see what’s happening to us in Syria.’ “I saw that he was proud of himself, that he wasn’t scared of anyone,” she related. “He was telling the story as though he had gone shopping and found a good bargain. He was happy. ” Keeping a cool head, Sonia asked Abaaoud how he had managed to regain entry to France. He told her that it had been easy to pass himself off as a migrant with no documents, adding “France is useless”. Whatsmore, he told Sonia that he had travelled with a group of about 90 fellow jihadis, including Syrians, Iraqis, French, German and British citizens. “He said they were spread around everywhere in the Paris region,” she said. But there were more horrors to come: he then went on to tell her that mistakes had been made in the attack on the 13th, and that he had remained near Paris to finish the job. “The exact phrase he told me was that there were failures, and I am here to ensure that there are no more failures. ” At that point Abaaoud left, asking his cousin to supply him with two suits, two pairs of shoes and a hideout, which she did, later visiting Abaaoud at the hideout. Upon her return to Sonia, Boulahcen was crying. “She told me, he will die,” Sonia said. It emerged that Abaaoud was planning further attacks, this time on a shopping centre, a police station and a children’s nursery in La Défense, a major business district in western Paris. “She told me it’s Thursday and in my head I say, I know I’ll stop them,” Sonia said. She called 197, the emergency number set up by the authorities in the wake of the attacks to advise them of the location of the hideout. The following day the French police raided the apartment, killing Abaaoud and an accomplice as well as Boulahcen. Following the raid Sonia was held in custody for her own protection. Police and prosecutors came to thank her, and asked her what she wanted, but, being tired, she misunderstood and told them she wanted to go home. “They told me that I will have to change my name, move city, and that I will be supported by specialist officers from witness protection. I didn’t expect that. I didn’t expect to never see my family or friends. “They told me to change all my habits, to pay attention to everything, not to give my identity to anyone, not to say what had happened, not to tell anyone that I had called 197. I must be silent. ” For several weeks she moved from hotel to hotel, eventually being given an apartment to live in. But she has been unable to apply for a new job as she has not yet been given new identity documents everything is still in her old name. “The state must treat me with consideration because without people like me, they’ll never succeed,” she said. “The proof of that is Abaaoud was there and they didn’t know it. ” France’s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve has denied failing Sonia, saying “we’re doing everything necessary”.",1.0
"Why Democrats are happy about Texas' early voting numbers. There's been record early voting turnout in Democratic primaries across Texas's 15 largest counties. The Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman noted a 105% spike compared to the 2014 midterm election — while Republican turnout only increased by 15%. Why it matters: Democrats haven't won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, and the state hasn't voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. But things are shifting this year, as Democrats are running in all of Texas' 36 congressional districts for the first time in 25 years. Wasserman's numbers suggest an energy that could threaten Republicans' seats across the state.  Yes, but: Early voting turnout like this is certainly a positive thing for Democrats running in Texas, but it's a limited sign of long-term success. If the party wants to turn the reddest state blue, these numbers would matter a lot more ahead of the general election in November.  One race to watch: TX-07, where Laura Moser is running against six other Democrats in a primary today. The DCCC recently released a brutal opposition memo encouraging Texas voters not to support Moser, calling her a ""Washington insider who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress."" Incumbent Republican Rep. John Culberson has held the seat for 17 years, so it'll be difficult for a progressive Democrat like Moser to succeed. But the Cook Political Report has now categorized the district as ""toss up.""",0.0
"The Atlantic Daily: A Bitter Bill to Swallow. The Dutch Elections: On Wednesday, Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, will lead his   party into a narrow contest against   populist Geert Wilders for control of the government. Wilders, whose platform centers on effectively banning Islam in the Netherlands, seems like a surprising choice in a country that’s historically known for tolerance —  but the story behind Wilders’s rise illustrates where those principles can break down. On a similar note: Back in the U. S. Congressman Steve King sent a racist tweet this weekend in support of Wilders. King has made similarly offensive comments in the past, but in the populist climate that fueled Trump’s rise, his extreme views are now harder to write off. The Bill for the Bill: The Congressional Budget Office today released its   report on the GOP   bill. The results aren’t promising: Although the new plan would reduce the federal deficit, 24 million Americans would lose health insurance, and those who keep it would see an increase in premiums. Most of those losing coverage would do so because of cuts to Medicaid —  but even people who get health care through their jobs would be affected by the bill’s repeal of the employer mandate. With points stacking up against the bill, it’s looking more and more like the plan to repeal Obamacare will fail —  and that might be best for the health of the Republican Party. Climate Science: Early reports suggest that Trump will sign an executive order tomorrow repealing Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which restricts power plants’   emissions. It will be the first step in what’s expected to be a thorough campaign to dismantle the U. S. regulations aimed at slowing climate change —  not to mention cutting funding for scientific research and for states’ environmental programs. What are environmentalists to do? They may have science on their side, but EPA Director Scott Pruitt denies it —  and here’s why facts alone aren’t enough to fight people’s false beliefs. Kate Robertson on the recent films starring female cannibals: Having spent the last five years studying the female cannibal (an admittedly odd subject even in academic circles) I’ve been fascinated by how the subject has gained more mainstream visibility of late. While the female cannibal isn’t new to pop culture, she’s relevant in ways that go beyond shock value, by capturing   social anxieties about gender, hunger, sex, and empowerment. These new works center on women who, in addition to eating humans, negotiate and subvert expectations for how women should look and behave. They’re motivated by physical hunger but also by sexual desire, making them an extension of the femme fatale —  the beautiful woman who deceives and ensnares men. In eating flesh, characters like Justine simply redirect this fear from the metaphorical to the physical. There’s a persistent stereotype that women will “suck men dry” well, these ones will literally devour you. Keep reading here, as Robertson explores what cannibal women represent in pop culture. 1.

In our August 1895 issue, he outlined his belief that the surface markings on Mars were constructed canals and described what that would mean: The evidence of handicraft, if such it be, points to a highly intelligent mind behind it. Irrigation, unscientifically conducted, would not give us such truly wonderful mathematical fitness in the several parts to the whole as we there behold. A mind of no mean order would seem to have presided over the system we see, a mind certainly of considerably more comprehensiveness than that which presides over the various departments of our own public works.   …     Quite possibly, such Martian folk are possessed of inventions of which we have not dreamed   …     Certainly, what we see hints at the existence of beings who are in advance of, not behind us, in the race of life.

"Analysts: Why China should bolster the yuan. China should allow its currency to appreciate in order to support the country's transition from an export and investment-driven economy to one led by consumer spending, analysts told CNBC on Tuesday. hit a 2016 high against the U.S.dollar on Tuesday as China's central bank set the midpoint rate of the yuan per dollar at its highest in over a month. That move seemed to contradict China's recent controlled devaluation of the yuan, which has fueled fears that the economy is on the ropes and needs a weak currency so that Chinese products remain competitive on the international market. Tuesday's move showed the People's Bank of China does not want to devalue the yuan in the near term or allow massive devaluation, said Leland Miller, president of analytics firm China Beige Book. Allowing the currency to appreciate sends a message the PBOC will maintain stability and advances its goal of shifting to a consumer-led economy, he added. ""By strengthening the currency, keeping it strong, you're putting purchasing power in the pockets of households. You're allowing them to buy more,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""If you want to switch from investment to consumption, this is one of the easiest ways to do it."" Patrick Chovanec, Silvercrest Asset Management's chief strategist, said China has sent mixed messages by shoring up the yuan and then letting it fall. However, he, too, said China should strengthen the yuan in order to support consumer spending. Chovanec said he has been as bearish as anyone on China's stock and property markets and the direction of the economy, but he added that hedge funds were wrong to treat troubles on China's horizon like the Asian financial crisis, which was essentially a debtor crisis. Some hedge fund managers such as Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass have made massive bets that the yuan will fall as loans held by Chinese banks go bad, forcing the PBOC to draw down foreign reserves to recapitalize financial institutions. To be sure, looming losses in China's debt market are bound to drag down the Chinese economy in significant ways, Chovanec said, but the key point is that China is not exposed to foreign debt. ""Where countries run into currency crises is when they owe a lot of money abroad, or where there's dependence on foreign financing to support consumption levels. China is not in that circumstance,"" he told ""Squawk Box."" Instead the yuan is facing pressure because capital is fleeing the country, which Chovanec chalked up to a failure to rebalance the economy and shift toward consumption. A weaker yuan would erode the purchasing power of Chinese consumers, which would create an incentive for them to convert yet more yuan into dollars. ""It's a very different kind of crisis with a very different kind of solution,"" Chovanec said. However, it is difficult to believe that with China's relatively low GDP per capita, the country can quickly transition to a consumer economy, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy at BK Asset Management and a CNBC contributor. ""You can't turn a Chinese consumer into an American consumer overnight. That I think is the biggest problem they're facing right now,"" he told ""Squawk Box."" The PBOC is ""playing chicken with the market,"" said Schlossberg. While consensus says the yuan must ultimately fall 20 to 25 percent to rebalance the economy and reflate trade numbers, a decline would only lead to more capital flight. January exports fell 11.2 percent from a year earlier — the seventh straight month of decline, while imports tumbled 18.8 percent — the 15th month of decline, both far worse than expected, data released Monday by the General Administration of Customs showed. There is no question the yuan will fall this year, most likely 5 to 8 percent, Evan Medeiros, Eurasia Group managing director for Asia, said Tuesday. ""It's going to be gradual over time. You're going to see more volatility in the price of the renminbi to try and squeeze the speculators out of the renminbi trade,"" he told ""Squawk Box,"" using another name for the yuan. —Reuters contributed to this story.",0.0
"Trump campaign releases results from candidate’s physical. In the letter dated Sept. 13, which comes as both he and Hillary Clinton move to disclose new details about their health, Trump’s longtime doctor Harold N. Bornstein said the candidate has undergone an annual physical exam since he has been under his care dating back to 1980. Trump is listed as 6 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing 236 pounds, which makes him overweight for his height. According to Bornstein, “Mr. Trump was hospitalized only once, as a child of 11 years old for an appendectomy. ” His doctor said in a letter that Trump takes a   drug and a “low dose aspirin. ” His blood tests show a cholesterol level of 169, with his level of   lipoproteins at 63, his   lipoproteins at 94, and a blood pressure rate that is 116 over 70. “We are pleased to disclose all of the test results which show that Mr. Trump is in excellent health, and has the stamina to endure  —   uninterrupted  —   the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and, more importantly, the singularly demanding job of President of the United States,” a Trump campaign press release said.

Toward the beginning of the song (currently available only through Apple) the    Toronto rapper says the following: I group DM my exesI told ‘em they belong to me, that goes on for foreverAnd I think we just get closer when we’re not together, This is demented stuff, no? The last two lines are something that a stalker says. The first line confesses to a behavior that not even the most frightened   about millennials would claim is a presently accepted use of social media. Taken all together, gulp, we might have a   premise on our hands. As is always the case with Drake’s many moments of    monstrousness, there’s relatable truth here. In the era where Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat serves as individual trophy rooms for human connection, terminated relationships can linger in the consciousness, suspended in eternal animation, more easily than ever before. Noreen Malone nailed this phenomenon in a 2013 New York essay that traced how George Strait’s “all my exes live in Texas” (a song referenced by Drake himself) became for, many people, “live in texts. ” Drake’s ongoing relevance owes to the fact that he is a mascot for so many trends, and this is one of them. He is the bard of what smartphones have done to dating if you wanted to argue for the existence of a trilogy spanning from his song “Marvin’s Room” to “Hotline Bling” to, now, “U With Me? ,” no one would send you a snotty tweet about it, hopefully. This song starts with an unanswered phone ring (and a DMX sample) and to depict the sketchiness of a relationship where neither party will commit, Drake mines the minutiae of text messaging: “3 dots, you thinkin’ of a reaction still,” “All that grey in our conversation history,” “LOLOL I’m glad you find this shit amusin’. ” The fact that he’s (even in exaggeration) DMing multiple exes suggests that he thinks of them less as individual human beings than as a conceptual category. For the first   of the song, his   drawling could indeed be directed at a generic “you” —  surely more than one suitor has heard that his pool parties are like Mardi Gras, and ideally you would never look someone in the eye and use a cornball simile like “You toyin’ with it like Happy Meal. ” The chorus refrain —  “is you wit’ me or what?” —  is basically mumbled he’s playing it casual, though no one makes a song like this about feeling casual. A muffled thump and melancholic keyboards, courtesy of the producers Kanye West and Noah “40” Shebib, keeps the mood feeling   but even, steady, numb. Then for the final verse, there’s a surge of emotion. The beat changes with a swarm of metallic skitters, and Drake soon after not only starts singing —  he also takes his voice to a place higher and more plaintive than he usually goes. What’s he so upset about? Memories of a   stay “you runnin’ your fingers through my curls” the thought of professional concerns that have kept him wary of settling down. This is pure, uncut yearning for a physical connection that’s lost to distance, time, and technology it’s the sound of fully remembering who’s behind the three dots. Melodramatic, hypocritical, and   as it may be, it’s one of the more shattering moments that popular music has offered this year.             Like this?

"How ‘animal spirits’ are looking a little tame. Despite monetary policy action by the European Central Bank (ECB), appetite for risk has diminished and investors are starting to look cautious, according to industry experts. Last week, the ECB announced an extensive stimulus package which included extending its monthly asset purchases and cutting its deposit rate to -0.4 percent. But, Michael Harris, managing director at Renaissance Capital, questioned whether the package would provide support for European markets to move higher. ""You need to see signs that this is actually working, that yes, the backdrop of such extremely low rates is filtering through to some animal spirits,"" he told CNBC on Tuesday. ""Right now, there is enough caution in the animal spirits that we can't take anything for granted."" Part of this caution, he explained, was related to fears that central banks around the world had the capacity to successfully guide markets. ""For a long time there wasn't much of a debate. The U.S. was recovering, rate hikes were coming, so it was easy to be in the (S&P 500),"" he added."" Now there's a serious debate about, OK, do central banks have enough fire power? "" European stock markets fell 1.42 percent on the day of the ECB announcement. Since then, the Euro Stoxx index has rallied 2.58 percent. Meanwhile, a poll of financial advisors in the U.K. published this week found clients' risk appetite had dropped. More than half (52 percent) said their clients appetite for risk had decreased over the last 12 months, while 8 percent said the drop had been dramatic. The online survey of 101 advisers, commissioned by investment platform Rplan, also found that 29 percent of the advisers expected the number of people in the U.K. investing in the stock market would fall this year. ""No doubt the volatility in January and 'Brexit' vote later this year are factors in making investors more cautious this year, although there are other issues around the world that need to be considered,"" said Stuart Dyer, Rplan's CIO, in a press release. ""But investing has never been easy and there have always been risks facing investors."" Follow CNBC International on and Facebook.",0.0
"California Today: In Virtual Reality, Investigating the Trayvon Martin Case - The New York Times. Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Peña combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Peña, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called “One Dark Night,” was recently shown at Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. “This is immersive journalism,” she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Peña by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. “One Dark Night” is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I’m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it’s meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I’ve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman’s position. We’re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what’s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

Years of drought put a damper on the foraging of fungus in the state’s forests, a hobby that has burgeoned with the growing popularity of fresh, local food. Amateur clubs up and down the state are organized around both the culinary and scientific celebration of California’s many mushroom species. As the rainfall began to surge last October, so did the autumn mushrooms, said Debbie Viess, a   of the Bay Area Mycological Society. “We had a tremendous year for porcinis,” she said, “and it’s been a really good year for chanterelles too. ” Even with the continuing rain, several mushroom experts were wary about making predictions for the spring season, when popular morel mushrooms are normally abundant. While water is necessary, it isn’t sufficient, said Patrick Hamilton, a longtime mushroom picker in Sonoma County. “There are so many things, from soil conditions, to climatic conditions, to the age of the trees, all these things are difficult to understand,” he said.

"Russia hacked ’every day’ from US territory, Kremlin says. Moscow (CNN) On the day the US awaited the testimony of former FBI chief James Comey on the Russian election hacking saga, Moscow said it had observed hacking attempts launched against it from US territory ”every day.” Speaking Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to be drawn on whether the alleged hacks were the work of government or   actors. ”Hacking attacks that are being carried out from the territory of the United States are recorded every day. Including attacks on the president’s website. It’s true,” Peskov told reporters. Read: Comey just went nuclear  Asked if his information indicated the attacks were carried out by intelligence agencies or unaffiliated hackers, Peskov said, ”I wouldn’t like to amuse the public by saying that official Washington is behind it. A hacking attack carried out from the territory of some country cannot mean that the authorities have anything to do with it.” Five things to watch: The Comey hearing, State Department Spokesman Heather Nauert said the Russian claim ”does not surprise me” and dismissed it as ”propaganda.” Messages left with the National Security Agency and White House were not immediately returned Thursday. Comey, Peskov’s statement comes hours before Comey appeared before the Senate intelligence committee in one of the most eagerly awaited hearings in decades. He followed through on expectations that he would publicly contradict aspects of US President Donald Trump’s accounts of their private conversations, characterizing some of the president’s comments as lies. His testimony represented a pivotal moment in the saga of Russian election hacking and alleged collusion by Trump aides that has cast a dark shadow over the opening months of the new administration. Comey faced questions about whether Trump abused his power in demanding loyalty from the former FBI chief. He was also grilled on claims the President obstructed justice by asking him to shut down part of the bureau’s Russia probe. Read: James Comey claims his moment at hearing, But while the US appears to be gripped by the case, Peskov insisted Moscow will not be paying much attention to the hearing in Washington. ”We are much more interested in the summit of the state leaders of Shanghai Cooperation Organization which takes place in Astana today and tomorrow,” Peskov added.

"EXCLUSIVE: Former RNC Chairman: Evidence Shows Hillary Clinton Never Qualified For Security Clearance - Breitbart. Hillary Clinton never actually met the official requirements to obtain a security clearance to handle classified information, according to a growing body of evidence. [“That is exactly the conclusion here based on the evidence,” former Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele told Breitbart News.  “The process is the process. The protocols are the protocols,” Steele said, noting that when you look at internal State Department evidence “this [conclusion] is where you’ll end up. ” Steele called the evidence presented here below “a case that everyone is going to have to pay attention to. ” When Hillary Clinton started her career at the State Department, she was required to sign a “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,” otherwise known as an   vowing to give back classified materials when she left the agency. Clinton signed that form in January 2009. But if you look at the copy of the document that the State Department released, you will find something very jarring: No one from the State Department signed it. Beneath Clinton’s signature, there is a box labeled “Acceptance” with the message: “The Undersigned Accepted This Agreement On Behalf of the United States Government. ” That box is left completely blank, with no signature and no date next to it. Since a person cannot sign a contract with herself, a case can be made that the document was never executed, according to citizen researcher Larry Kawa, who brought this evidence to the attention of Breitbart News.  And in the box showing that a “Witness” observed execution of the contract, the signature line is REDACTED by the State Department and the date is written in the same handwriting that Clinton used to write the date in her own signature box. Federal government records show that a person issued a security clearance must have an EXECUTED   form. The official Defense Security Service Powerpoint presentation “  Webinar:     Agreement,” a tutorial for government workers, makes clear that a person’s   must be executed. “An individual issued an initial personnel security clearance (PCL) must execute a Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement ( ) prior to being granted access to classified information,” according to the presentation, which is published as a document on the Defense Security Service website. Clinton’s private email scandal is growing bigger as she prepares to become the Democratic nominee for president. Breitbart News exclusively reported that Hillary Clinton and her top aide Cheryl Mills avoided signing a mandatory agreement to return classified materials when they left the State Department. Breitbart News obtained confirmation on State Department letterhead that Hillary Clinton did NOT sign a mandatory   “Separation Statement” when she left the State Department. That statement would have required her to affirm that she had returned all classified materials in her possession. Clinton’s top aide Cheryl Mills also avoided signing a separation statement. Mills actually filed hers, but it was left completely blank. Additionally, Clinton never certified that she went through a mandatory security debriefing to learn how to handle classified information. As Breitbart News detailed, citizen researcher Larry Kawa was targeted with a voice mail message and an email from State Department officials in which the Department admitted to “mistakenly” mailing out sensitive information on the Clinton case, asked him to return the sensitive information as soon as he got it in the mail, and warned him not to disclose any of the information they thought he’d been sent. “When you look at the pieces, you look at how the State Department reacted to his FOIA request and said ‘Holy crap! Houston we have a problem here!” Steele said. The Clinton campaign and the State Department did not return requests for comment.",1.0
"When Undiplomatic Talk Wasn’t Awful. There were two   scandals du jour on Thursday. One concerned a joke the president made at the National Prayer Breakfast, in which he asked those present to pray for better ratings for his successor on the New Celebrity Apprentice television show. But the main reason for a daily dose of outrage against President Trump wasn’t generated by sympathy for Arnold Schwarzenegger or even dismay over a joke about prayer. Rather, it was the reaction to the reports about what appears to have been a stormy conversation with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. According to reports, Trump told Turnbull it was “the worst call by far” with a foreign leader. The stormy dispute was even alleged to have ended with Trump hanging up on one of America’s staunchest allies. Though both sides said that last part wasn’t true, there was little doubt it was a difficult conversation. One can well imagine Trump responding to Turnbull’s insistence that the U. S. stick to President Obama’s agreement to take in migrants that Australia didn’t want by saying (as he allegedly did) that the Aussies were trying to force them to take in the “next Boston bombers. ” There is something to be said for not picking fights with friends in public, and it was probably unnecessary for the two leaders to engage in an open dispute when continued cooperation between the two nations on security issues is so much more important than the fate of 1, 250 migrants currently held on some of Australia’s   possessions. Trump should try remembering Theodore Roosevelt’s admonition that Americans should “speak softly while carrying a big stick” rather than mouthing off every time he doesn’t like something. But those damning Trump for this latest evidence of his unsuitability for the presidency need to take a deep breath. That’s especially true for the chorus of press critics who were ardent fans of President Obama. Using undiplomatic language with allies is a bad thing, but it is not a principle that was upheld by Obama. None of those knocking Trump uttered a word of criticism when the 44th president and his aides were regularly insulting Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But leaving aside the hypocrisy of Trump’s liberal critics, that isn’t the only absurd aspect of this “scandal. ” There is also the question of whether it is wrong for Trump to think he has the right to criticize or even renege on a deal done by a predecessor. Trump probably isn’t alone in being surprised to hear about the   swap Obama made with Turnbull. In exchange for taking in people (largely from the same countries regarding which Trump ordered a temporary pause on immigration) that Australia doesn’t want on its soil, the U. S. planned to ship down under illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. How this is in America’s interest eludes me at first glance as, no doubt, it did Trump. But a deal’s a deal and if Obama shook on it with the Aussies, it’s an ironclad principle that Trump must also honor it, right? Maybe, but that’s another principle Obama didn’t respect when it came to America’s Israeli ally. President George W. Bush sent a letter to Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon in 2004 in which the U. S. promised to recognize Israel’s right to keep Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and its major settlement blocs on the border with the West Bank, as well as to the Israelis’ right to build there. In exchange for this, Sharon pulled every soldier, settler, and settlement out of Gaza, a decision that ultimately led to the creation of an Islamist terror state run by Hamas in the strip. But when Obama came into office, the Israelis were told that the Bush letter was null and void. Washington not only continuously attacked the Israelis about building in Jerusalem and the settlement blocs, but also made more of an issue of the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem than any of Obama’s predecessors had. Seen in that light, outrage about Trump’s brusque attitude toward the Australians doesn’t seem so terrible, or at least not any worse than Obama’s undiplomatic conduct. There’s plenty wrong with Trump’s temperament but the high dudgeon about his bad behavior on the phone with foreign leaders is not only hypocritical, it’s a political loser. Americans aren’t likely to be outraged about a president who talks tough to friends or foes. Nor are they likely to be convinced that this is a big deal by those who had no problem with Obama’s insults of other allies.  —   Jonathan S. Tobin is a contributor to National Review Online.

"No Memorial For Slain Migrant Worker In Sweden For Fear Of Offending Migrants. The municipal government in the Swedish town where an asylum centre worker was stabbed to death refuses to allow a memorial at the centre for fear of offending migrants. [Swedish media SVT reports that the   of the victim wished to honour the memory of    Alexandra Mezher (pictured) who was stabbed to death by an underage Somali male on the 25th of January. The case provoked an international uproar which has led many to question the Swedish government’s handling of the migrant crisis.  The request for a memorial comes after Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven visited the centre for underage migrants in Örnsköldsvik and said “This is a tragedy. You should be able to feel safe at work and the children and young people who arrive in Sweden alone will be able to feel safe,” as he talked with police, trade unions and municipal officials. Carl Lindahl, who has worked at a similar asylum centre for over three years and is now on stress leave since December said, “What happened in Mölndal could just as easily have happened here. ” Lindhal, along with another colleague, wished to organize a small rally or march in the town to express mourning for Ms. Mezher but were shocked to learn that the municipality not only refused to fly their flag at half mast but also denied them use of any municipal premises. Since the city wasn’t going to allow them to do anything, Lindhal decided to hold a memorial service in a local church on Sunday instead. “God is actually infinitely greater than the municipal manager in Örnsköldsvik, and I felt that we must implement it here, so we moved manifestation here instead. ” Locals asked why the municipality was against the demonstration and a representative reached out to SVT and told them the municipality was worried about offending the migrants at the asylum centre. Katarina Jensstad, administrative manager, said the council had simply decided it would be inappropriate to build a memorial at a home for vulnerable minors. The story of the murder has resonated across Sweden and with the Swedish people. Inspired to take action because of the events, Swedish men joined together to form groups to protect women in Stockholm train station from unwanted sexual advances from migrants. Some, like commentator Pamela Geller, are even saying the incident could be the beginning of the end of Swedish tolerance and that a potential “civil war” could ensue. The story also revealed to Swedes how they might not be even getting the full story on the case as Breitbart revealed the Daily Mail was blocking details of the story to Swedish internet users in what some allege to be interference from Stockholm.",1.0
"For Trump, it was the lost art of the deal.  In the end, the Closer couldn’t close the deal. For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U. S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support. It brings into question the neophyte president’s ability to move   legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a   and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold ”  ” promises to shake up Washington. The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver. ”This is the most consequential day of Trump’s presidency and it’s not just a failure, it’s a stunning failure,” Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.  Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and   Republican members who were unmoved by Trump’s ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system. “We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the   process,” Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities. It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump’s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the   conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill. The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.  Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act   the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.  “This demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.  ”Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re in the real game,” Barton told Reuters. Representative Mario   of Florida called it “a big blow” for the Republican agenda. Trump’s efforts to engage the bill’s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didn’t seem to mind, calling Trump a ”great closer. ”)  But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered. Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump’s   tactics backfired.  “Threats don’t work in general,” he said. “They cause damage to relationships. They definitely don’t work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed. ” ESCAPING A LOOMING DISASTER     After the bill was revised along Trump’s specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a   owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. “There are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same. ” The lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryan’s office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives.  Congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trump’s healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich. There was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months. And if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls.  Instead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will  still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal. “This is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right,” said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to ”start over.” It is unclear when that could happen. ”This bill is dead,” said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team.  (Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Richard Cowan and Joseph Ax; Editing by Jason Szep and Leslie Adler) CHICAGO The fate of a spending plan and tax hike aimed at ending Illinois’ unprecedented   budget impasse moved on Tuesday to the   House of Representatives, which will seek to enact the legislation by overriding the Republican governor’s vetoes.

"The Teenagers of Rikers Island. Some might have seen a lost cause. Lisante saw a student in crisis. Three decades later, Lisante is the superintendent of New York City’s District 79, which consists of over 14, 000 students who have fallen behind in high school been involved in the   system or who have special needs such as drug treatment, job training, or child care. Years ago, the district used to include transfer schools, which serve   and   students, and other small high schools. Now it is a network of programs for students learning outside of traditional school settings. Lisante said he is especially focused on the formerly incarcerated youth he first saw when he started as assistant principal —  because they often need the most help. New York has come under scrutiny for how it treats youth in the   system. It is one of two states nationwide that still prosecutes all youth as adults when they turn 16, though legislators are engaged in a battle this year to change that. A 2014 report by the former Manhattan U. S. Attorney Preet Bharara found a “  culture of violence” at the adolescent facilities on Rikers Island, and the city proposed a plan to move   and   olds from the island to a facility in the Bronx. Against that backdrop, Lisante is working to restore hope. He said the worst part of his job is seeing teenagers who seem to have given up, but the best part is watching those same young adults turn a corner. We met Lisante at a conference for “transition specialists,” who help students regain their footing after they leave detention centers. It’s one way he’s trying to make sure these students get a second chance, he said. “When I first went to Rikers, I had a whole different picture,” Lisante said. But once he was there, he remembers thinking, “This is it? These are the most egregious kids in New York City? I just realized they were a lot like my own sons. ” We spoke to Lisante about his work in District 79, how he plans to help New York City’s   youth, and whether New York state’s graduation requirements are too tough. The interview below has been condensed and edited for clarity. Monica Disare: What got you interested in this type of work? Tim Lisante: I worked in a vocational high school in the South Bronx and I became assistant principal of special ed there. One day, I saw this ad and all it said was “assistant principal, Rikers. ”   …     So I went to Rikers, and the funny thing is, I never went to Rikers before I took the job. I interviewed in Manhattan and I remember driving over the bridge and seeing all these jails and that razor wire and saying maybe I should turn around. But that was 30 years ago. When I got to Rikers, I really found that was my niche because the students [have] so many needs, multiple needs.   …     It’s really exciting work and it’s a population that really gets overlooked, that has no real advocates. Disare: You said you grew up about five miles away. Lisante: I went to Holy Cross, a Catholic school in Flushing, [Queens]. Literally, it’s less than five miles from Rikers, but my experience was so great in high school. That’s one of the reasons I became a teacher. I love school. So then when I go to Rikers   …     and I see the experience that   and    have, it’s so different from what it should be. The worst experience of my career is seeing kids who give up hope at 16 and 17. What we’re trying to do is renew that hope. There’s nothing that we like better —  that I like better —  than these graduations in June. One of the best things about the graduations is looking at the parents. These parents have been through a lot. They come, like, two hours before the ceremony. They’re so happy. They don’t want to leave after it’s over. Everybody’s taking pictures and everything because their children have come a long way. Those graduations   …     make this work really worthwhile. Disare: How do you tackle the hopelessness? Lisante: One of the things that we are really proud of in District 79 is we have a very good    ratio. We have social workers, guidance counselors, that are really, really dedicated and we give them training. I’m also concerned about them because they’re hearing horrible stories every single day, you know, in small groups and in individual counseling. A lot of issues we can tackle in a group during the advisory. A lot of them have to be tackled individually because there are so many needs and it’s so hard to get teenagers to open up. For example, I mentioned homelessness. Kids don’t admit that they’re homeless. Disare: But you’re often still able to reach them? Lisante: Yeah, it’s the greatest thing   …     The students all get a photo ID when they come in and then we always contrast that photo ID with their graduation picture and, you know, it’s night and day. Like I said before, it’s a harrowing experience to be in any [of these] situations, and you remember what that student was like when they first got in. To see them persist, overcome, pass these Regents [statewide standardized tests] and get a   diploma, or a   equivalency —  that’s a great thing for that student, that student’s family, and their community. Disare: You mentioned   equivalency diplomas. When and how do you help students pursue that option? Lisante: Pathway to Graduation is basically the biggest   equivalency program for students under 21 [in the city]   …     We prepare students to get the skills they need to pass the exam. We help them with college admissions and pay for the [City University of New York] waiver and college counseling. The neat thing about Pathways to Graduation is it’s more than just a   class. We have about probably 75 of these sites through New York City and they’re in traditional high schools, like [DeWitt] Clinton [in the Bronx] Edward R. Murrow High School [in Brooklyn]. We’re also in college campuses   …     [But] a lot of students don’t want that kind of setting anymore. We offer paid internships within hospitals, a wide range of   they can do, a variety of internship experiences, all kinds of jobs. I met two students who have children in the city’s LYFE program [which provides free child care] at DeWitt Clinton High School. They go upstairs to our Pathways to Graduation program, and now they’re going to   Tech [which provides career certification courses for students]. Those are students who are in three of our programs simultaneously. Disare: You have a lot to manage. What is your priority right now? Lisante: We look at the students that are the most at risk, the furthest away from a diploma, and that’s why we are putting so much into the transition services at Rikers. To me, they’re the furthest away from the   diploma. It’s a really, really difficult thing. The same thing for the kids in drug treatment. Supporting those students   …     so they stick and they stay and they don’t drop out —  that’s our biggest priority. That’s our biggest mission: to help those students that are fading to get back on track and to stay on track. Disare: What’s the hardest part of helping   youth? Lisante: The hardest thing about these programs is there’s what we call a rolling register: kids come in and out every day. Schools are not built like that. Schools are built on school years and semesters. Again, when I taught [at Rikers] I’d give a test on a Friday, I’d have three new kids come in on Thursday and three leave on Thursday. So that’s why [it’s easier] to work with students that are sentenced because   …     they know they’re going to be there every day. But most of our students are awaiting the outcome of a case. It makes it very difficult. That speaks to the urgency of the work. You know, again, I came from a high school. We had four years to work with students. We don’t have four years [at Rikers]. We’ve got 40 days. That’s why every day is important. Every minute counts. We ask these students [on the] first day, “Where are you going to go to school when you get out? Do you want to go back to your school? We’ll make that connection. Do you want a new school? Do you want an arts school?” Whatever it is, we put the wheels in motion day one. Disare: As you said, the average student is only enrolled at East River Academy [in Queens] for 45 days. What are the three most important things to do in that time? Lisante: One of them is to get them the   [stability]. It’s an unbelievable process when you get arrested and go through the court system and the handcuffs and the central booking and all this. And then, we expect students right away once they get to us to take an assessment test. How much do you know about math? So we really have to look at that piece first and be very welcoming and comforting and get them settled in and make sure their parents know where they’re at physically and educationally. Disare: And the city has introduced “transition counselors” for youth leaving detention centers. Why is that role important? Lisante: What we’ve found is that students go back to school, they do well, but they don’t always stick. So the transition specialists support the student, and the family, and the receiving school, all the way through graduation. A lot of times that first placement doesn’t work out, so okay, let’s find something else. You want a vocational school, let’s do that. You want a   equivalency, let’s do that. [We do] not give up on students at any point. Disare: What’s a day in the life of a transition specialist like? Lisante: We’re really focused on the students’ aspirations and the students’ dreams. What do they want to do next once they graduate? [We] kind of plan backwards from there. So what the transition specialist does is creates that plan,   it with a student. The student has ownership of it. And then from there, they check in against that plan weekly or every other week. Transition specialists work both in the facility and then in the community. When we transition a student and we know they have a   support, we’re really comfortable that we handed that student off to that organization. It’s the kids that don’t have any support in the community that we’re really concerned about. We have an increasing number of   kids and homeless kids, so when they get out, they really have very little support and our transition specialists have to do a lot more connecting of resources than [for] a typical student. Disare: Do you think state officials are doing enough to provide opportunities for your students to graduate? Even the   options require passing multiple Regents exams. Lisante: They’re on the right track. They’re doing more and more and we’ve met with the Board of Regents on this issue and on the issue of a   equivalency being considered as a diploma and not a     …     The   equivalency, it’s a very tough test to pass, and I think these students should get full credit for graduating because it’s a viable option to go on to higher education. Disare: What do you want the world to know about these students? Lisante: That’s the word I use all the time. They’re students and they’re kids, they’re children, they’re young. When I first went to Rikers, I had a whole different picture. [Then I realized] this is it? These are the most egregious kids in New York City? I just realized they were a lot like my own sons. They are teenagers. And everybody deserves a second chance. That’s my big message. I’ve seen so many of these students get turned around and head in the right direction. Unfortunately, we don’t hear about them. We hear about the recidivism and the   which is a very small percentage of our students. Again, most of them are   offenders and this is a transformative experience that they have with us. Then through these transition specialists, [they] connect into the schools and go onto graduate and have happy lives. This post appears courtesy of Chalkbeat New York.",-0.5
" After Trump Win, The Alt-Right Prepares For An Unexpected Future.  WASHINGTON  —   The white nationalist   movement, once the very definition of fringe politics, is facing a truly unexpected scenario: Their preferred candidate is about to be in the White House. To capitalize on this turn of events,   leaders held a press conference on Saturday at the gathering of the National Policy Institute, the white nationalist think tank headed by Richard Spencer. The event was held in the Ronald Reagan Building in downtown Washington, and attracted vigorous protests outside. Spencer appeared onstage with VDare’s Peter Brimelow,   writer Kevin MacDonald, Arktos editor Jason Jorjani, and American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor. More than two dozen reporters were in attendance, a stark shift from previous   gatherings that attracted fewer. Behind the press conference, the rest of the NPI attendees gathered to watch, at times booing and jeering the reporters when they asked questions. The audience was nearly all young, white, and male, with some sporting Make America Great Again hats and many displaying the “fashy”   haircut common to the movement. The   Spencer said, had before the election been like a “head without a body,” trapped in internal conversations and debates. “The Trump movement was a kind of body without a head,” Spencer said, saying that Trump’s campaign had been “ ” on policy despite having the right instincts on foreign policy and immigration. “I think moving forward the   as an intellectual vanguard can complete Trump. ” Spencer, who can take credit for coining the name of the movement, believes the   has a “psychic connection” with Trump in a way they do not with other Republicans. Indeed, the very name of the   indicates its wish to disassociate itself from the wider right: An important part of its project is to challenge and dismantle the conservative movement. Spencer and the others are careful not to identify Trump himself as   nor his campaign CEO and    White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. The   leaders are aware of their political radioactivity and seek to not harm Trump by linking arms too firmly with him. “I don’t think Steve Bannon is   as I would define the term,” Spencer said, saying Bannon has no direct connection to the movement but that “I think a few of us have shaken his hand” and that there is “common ground” between the beliefs of Bannon and those of the  . Bannon has described Breitbart as a “platform for the ” and under his watch, the site evolved to embrace   ideologies. Spencer said he 90% agreed with Bannon’s assessment but doesn’t think Breibart itself is   per se. “It’s clearly moved away from the conservative movement, it was   and it was also a site that tons of people on the   like, they get their news from, they share,” Spencer said. Now that Trump has won, the   must grapple with policy in   terms. NPI plans to start putting out policy papers as recommendations for the Trump administration going forward (regardless of whether these specific plans will ever have audience in the White House) the first, out now, is called “Beyond NATO. ” One proposal by Spencer is to institute a   freeze on net immigration. He also spoke approvingly of Ivanka Trump’s federally sponsored maternity leave proposals, and of the choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Spencer told me later that he’s also proposing a “less is more” idea in which there is less college attendance and college is reserved for a “cognitive elite,” and a “greatness agenda” involving wildlife conservation. The  ’s willingness to push the boundaries of left vs. right gives it common ground with European   movements, a fact Spencer acknowledged during the press conference, saying, “I would say that many people here have been influenced pretty profoundly by the European new right. ” His   Jorjani’s website, Arktos, translates works of the European movement into English. Spencer has emerged alongside Brimelow and Taylor in particular as the public face of the movement as it gained notoriety during the election cycle. A sardonic man with a fondness for   suits, Spencer clearly relishes the attention, and told me afterward how much fun he’d found the press conference to be. He says he’s beginning to be recognized in public someone came up to him on the T in Boston and told him, “God bless you, Mr. Spencer,” he said. But even if some of the leaders crave the limelight as they bask in Trump’s glow, many of the   rank and file are still wary of public attention. Spencer gave a warning to the media before the press conference to not film attendees without their permission. The   is generally hostile towards the media  —   a term that’s currently in vogue is “lügenpresse,” an old term used by the Nazis meaning “lying press.   Twitter trolls have aggressively attacked journalists, particularly Jewish ones, for the entire election cycle. (Last week, Twitter cracked down and banned several   accounts, including Spencer’s.) Many in the movement use a nom de guerre at these events for fear of being doxxed. I spoke with a    who goes by Ajax and who was wearing a pin that he said signified his membership with Identity Evropa, a group that he said organizes direct actions based around white identity. These actions include giving out flyers. “We understand identity groups broadly like BLM, and to a lesser extent Zionism, on the level that most liberals and conservatives never will be able to because we recognize what it’s like to be completely uprooted and be without an identity and feel alienated from society at large,” Ajax said. A frequent criticism of the term   and particularly of the media’s use of the term, is that it is a kind of euphemism: an attempt to elide the movement’s focus on white nationalism and preoccupation with race. Speaking from the stage on Saturday, Taylor denied that the use of the term is an attempt to sanitize the movement’s true beliefs. “The suggestion in your question is that this is some kind of attempt to hide the ball,” Taylor said. “To pretend that we are not who we are. No one is guilty of that. We are as straightforward as any movement I can imagine. ”  ",-1.0
