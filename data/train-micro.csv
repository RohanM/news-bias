"Radio.Garden lets you tune into the globe – TechCrunch. Some of the most beautiful products are the simplest. Take Radio.Garden, for example. This project by Golo Föllmer at Martin-Luther University Halle displays a photorealistic globe full of green dots. Swing your mouse over one of the dots — in Iran, Estonia or the Faroe Islands — and you can hear a local radio station. The interface itself is surprisingly calming. You’re immediately drawn to the farthest corners of the Earth. Rolling over Iceland brings up some Spice Girls and some local talk radio. Visiting Tehran calls a swirl of disco out of the ambient hisses and pops that Radio.Garden adds to the experience. It’s a beautiful reminder that wherever you go you can probably hear Eric Clapton or Jamiroquai clamoring out of a tinny speaker in some back-alley cafe or a dark taxi. “By bringing distant voices close, radio connects people and places,” writes Föllmer. “Radio Garden allows listeners to explore processes of broadcasting and hearing identities across the entire globe. From its very beginning, radio signals have crossed borders. Radio makers and listeners have imagined both connecting with distant cultures, as well as re-connecting with people from ‘home’ from thousands of miles away — or using local community radio to make and enrich new homes.” He’s absolutely right. Radio has been given short shrift in this era of always on information. It’s a medium from another era, truncated in about 2000 by consolidation and the bubble gumming of the airwaves. But we’re reminded by this beautiful project that there is nothing more magical than picking up a tinny FM station on a long drive between two distant spots and living, for a moment, behind the windows and walls of a far off farmhouse silhouetted by the moon and full of light and sound and life.",0.0
"Julian Assange Sees ’Incredible Double Standard’ In Clinton Email Case. Julian Assange says if the United States government sees him as a threat to national security, it should see Hillary Clinton as one, too. In an interview with Morning Edition’s David Greene, the founder of WikiLeaks called the Department of Justice’s decision not to prosecute Clinton for handling classified information on her private email server an ”incredible double standard.” Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for four years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning on suspicion of rape. In a statement last month, FBI director James Comey said the FBI ”did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws,” but that the use of a private email server was ”extremely careless.” Comey advised the Justice Department that ”no charges are appropriate in this case,” and career prosecutors agreed. Assange noted that, had a case proceeded, Clinton could have been prosecuted under the Espionage Act of 1917, which bans the disclosure of classified information to an unauthorized person ”with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States.” Assange said in the past courts have found that a lack of intent to harm the United States did not absolve the accused of guilt. ”There has been an interpretation saying that it doesn’t matter that you didn’t intend to harm the United States, but they seem to have changed the standard.” In 2013, U. S. Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning was convicted of the Espionage Act after disclosing classified military information to WikiLeaks. Some have criticized the conviction, arguing Manning was a whistleblower, not a spy with intent to harm the United States. In his NPR interview, Assange regarded the open disclosure of information with reverence. He referred to WikiLeaks’ 11 million documents as a ”rebel Library of Alexandria.” ”I believe that the way to justice is education,” Assange said. ”By bringing out into the public domain how human institutions actually behave, we can understand frankly, to a degree, for the first time the civilization that we actually have.” As an example, he cited one of WikiLeaks’ more recent publications: the 20, 000 hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those emails revealed that some senior DNC staffers had worked to promote the candidacy of Hillary Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. Four DNC officials resigned in the aftermath, including its chair, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Assange called the leak ”a great journalistic scoop.” ”That’s a remarkable and important contribution to U. S. democracy by our sources and by WikiLeaks,” Assange said. He questioned how other publications might have handled the information. ”What media organization who had received that information would not publish it? I think that’s a real question. I would like to say the answer is no media organization would censor that material,” Assange said. But, he added, ”I’m not confident that in fact all media in the United States would have published those emails,” referring to what he called the partisan nature of the U. S. media landscape leading up to the election. The potential source of the leaked material has intrigued some as much as its substance: U. S. officials have said they’re ”highly confident” the DNC hack was the work of the Russian government. Assange said he could not give any information to Greene about who his sources are. ”So far we have a perfect record of WikiLeaks having never revealed information that exposed a source over 10 years,” Assange said. In the interview, Assange also spoke about the Trump campaign  ” he’d happily receive any authentic ”internal documentation” from it. And when asked about the murder of a DNC staffer early last month, who some have speculated was a WikiLeaks source, Assange repeated that WikiLeaks does not disclose its sources, ”even dead sources.”",-0.5

"Who’s Getting Money from NIH?. As Democrats and the scientific establishment howl over President Trump’s proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Congress is investigating whether that agency misspent U. S. tax dollars to fund two European cancer institutions now under scrutiny for conflicts of interest and dubious science. Key lawmakers are also trying to understand the nature of the cozy relationship between federal bureaucrats with budgets and foreign researchers who are eager to accept grants to promote a political agenda at taxpayers’ expense. On March 24, House Science, Space, and Technology Committee chairman Lamar Smith sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (who oversees NIH) requesting information about millions of dollars paid to the Ramazzini Institute, an obscure but controversial cancer    based in Italy. The funds were given out by NIH’s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) run by Linda Birnbaum she is also, coincidentally, a Ramazzini fellow. According to the Ramazzini Institute’s website, it achieves “extremely important results at international level [sic] in research into carcinogenic substances present in the environment we live in and in the food that we eat. ” Ramazzini claims to work with NIH to develop “experimental data from   cancerogenesis bioassays . . . and make available to the scientific community the data of the studies published, and therefore to allow qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the risk and other research. ” Despite this claim, no scientific research or budget information is available on their website. Birnbaum  —   who describes her research as focusing on “the pharmacokinetic behavior of environmental chemicals, mechanisms of action of toxicants including endocrine disruption, and linking of   exposures to health effects”  —   has used her post at NIH to waste hundreds of millions of tax dollars promoting a chemophobic agenda. Her agency gave out $172 million in research grants between 2000 and 2014 to try to show how bisphenol A  —   commonly known as BPA  —   affects humans, particularly as a vague “endocrine disruptor. ” Birnbaum also squandered $25 million on research that allegedly found male rats exposed to cell phones for nine hours a day had a slight increase in two types of cancer. (She did not respond to an   seeking comment about Congress’s investigation into her agency.) In a September 2016 letter to NIH, Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, had harsh words for IARC: “Despite this record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies, IARC receives substantial taxpayer funding from NIH. ” He asked for an accounting of NIH’s funding to IARC, saying their standards are “inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm. ” IARC and Ramazzini also have ties. The working group that produced one of IARC’s most controversial reports  —   suggesting that the common weed killer glyphosate is probably carcinogenic  —   included five Ramazzini fellows. That report has been under fire because it flies in the face of other findings as the only study to show that glyphosate causes cancer. Now activists are trying to get the product banned. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, is used on many genetically engineered crops, which environmental activists oppose. The man who initiated the glyphosate report  —   Dr. Christopher Portier  —   also has ties to Birnbaum and NIEHS. Portier worked for NIEHS for 32 years, most recently serving as Birnbaum’s associate director, and had his own laboratory focused on how the environment negatively impacts human health. He, like Birnbaum, is a Ramazzini fellow. Portier has since become a     activist. This is just one more example of how science has been politicized at several federal agencies and why it’s necessary for Congress to finally demand accountability. Under the Obama administration, federal agencies including NIH refused to fully comply with FOIA requests and inquiries from Congress those records should now be available under the Trump administration. Activists within the   world want us to believe that any cuts to federal research spending will devastate scientific progress. In reality, the NIEHS’s cell phone, BPA, and Ramazzini debacles underscore the fact that when stewards of federal research dollars divert apparently essential science funds to support pet political projects and then defy oversight, Congress and the Trump administration aren’t the ones who should be blamed for halting scientific advances.,",1.0
"Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Calls Donald Trump’s Star of David Tweet Anti-Semitic - The New York Times. Hillary Clinton’s campaign said on Monday that an image posted by Donald J. Trump on Twitter over the weekend that showed a photo of Mrs. Clinton against a backdrop of $100 bills and a Star of David was “blatantly  . ” The post accused Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, of being the “most corrupt candidate ever. ” But critics seized on the episode as the latest example of a longtime pattern of racially charged remarks by Mr. Trump, saying the post was meant to exploit stereotypes against Jewish people. In a rebuke on Tuesday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said in a radio interview with Charlie Sykes on WTMJ in Milwaukee, according to The Hill website: “Look,   images, they’ve got no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. ” Mr. Ryan added, “I really believe he’s got to clean up how his new media works. ” The backlash has been swift enough to cause Mr. Trump to do something relatively out of character: He deleted the original post, later sharing an image showing Mrs. Clinton next to a circle instead of the   star. The news website Mic traced the first image, posted by Mr. Trump on Saturday, to a message board containing   and   imagery, and to Twitter accounts that circulated the images. Sarah Bard, the Clinton campaign’s director of Jewish outreach, said in a statement: “Donald Trump’s use of a blatantly   image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it’s a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern. Now, not only won’t he apologize for it, he’s peddling lies and blaming others. ” Though he replaced the image (one observer noted that the tips of the star were still visible in the new post) Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Monday to defend his original decision to post the image with a star. “Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff’s Star, or plain star!” he wrote. In a statement released on Monday night, Mr. Trump dismissed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign’s criticism as “false” and “ridiculous” and repeated his claim that the image was a “basic star often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior. ” But some social media users have disputed Mr. Trump’s suggestion, with one person asking why would he delete a posting if he truly believed it was a sheriff’s star. Mr. Trump’s supporters have insisted that the image never contained a Star of David and that people were being too sensitive or politically correct. Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, appeared on Sunday on CNN and called the reaction “political correctness run amok. ” Other Trump supporters said on Twitter that the news media was exploiting a nonissue. They said they supported the theory that those accusing Mr. Trump of   were creating a fictional subtext for the image. “The only reason the Trump sheriff star tweet is controversial is because CNN makes it that way,” wrote one supporter of Mr. Trump. But white nationalists, including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, weighed in with praise for the tweet: The   League has long condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks on immigrants as hate speech and stereotyping. It called on him in 2015 to stop “fomenting hatred. ” On Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the group’s chief executive, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s handling of the controversy over the posting did not pass muster. “The most appropriate response to the criticisms would be to address them   to apologize, and to articulate firmly and forcefully that bigotry of any sort has no place in this campaign, and that hate has nothing to do with making America great again,” Mr. Greenblatt said. Mr. Trump seemed eager on Monday to move beyond the episode. He posted a flurry of messages about his potential choices for a   running mate: “The only people who are not interested in being the V. P. pick are the people who have not been asked!” He then wrote a post that blamed radical Islam for terrorist attacks.",-1.0
"This is Nest’s new video doorbell – TechCrunch. We’re live at a Nest press conference in San Francisco, where the company is debuting new products rapid fire. The latest debut: Nest Hello, a smart video doorbell. If you’re familiar with existing products like the Ring video doorbell, this one is of a similar vein — just with all of Nest’s usual polish. It’s got a microphone/speaker rig built-in so you can communicate with whoever’s at your door — but, in a clever move, they’ve also provided pre-recorded, tap-to-send quick responses for those times when shouting at your phone is inconvenient. Also super clever: Nap mode. Built with parents with sleeping babies in mind, you can disable your in-house chime while continuing to receive doorbell alerts on your phone. Meanwhile, the Hello will pick up the person/facial recognition system that Nest has spent the last few years building out in its Nest Cam IQ line. That means it can recognize whether that motion on your front porch is a human poking around or just some leaves blowing by. Nest says Hello will ship in Q1 of 2018; no price has been mentioned just yet.",0.0
"Whaling watchdog shrinks loophole allowing Japan’s ’scientific’ hunts.  The world’s whaling watchdog has voted to conduct stricter reviews of whales killed under an exemption to a    moratorium which Japan’s critics say it abuses to hunt for meat.  The resolution on Thursday, opposed by Japan and fellow whalers Norway and Iceland, was adopted by 34 yes votes to 17 against, at the 66th meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). It is not legally binding on members of the commission, which has no policing or penalty function. Submitted by Australia and New Zealand, the resolution seeks to “improve” the review process for scientific whaling programmes  —   which Japan alone conducts, netting more than 15, 000 of the marine mammals since 1986. “We welcome this result as an important reaction to Japan unilaterally issuing its own permits for   scientific whaling,” said Matt Collis of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “We all know that scientific whaling is sham science, and simply commercial whaling by another name. ” Japan defended its annual Southern Ocean whale hunt, saying it was gathering scientific data. The country insisted its actions were in keeping with a 2014 ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which found that permits issued by Japan were “not for purposes of scientific research” and instructed the country to halt its Jarpa II programme. “Reports oftentimes say (that) irrespective of the ICJ judgment Japan started the research, or in violation of the ICJ judgment . .. and that’s not true,” Japan’s commissioner to the IWC, Joji Morishita told fellow delegates. In the judgment of the court itself, “it is clear that the ICJ assumes there can be future research activities,” he insisted. “The ICJ also said . .. that the use of lethal sampling per se is not unreasonable in relation to the research objectives,” Morishita added. After the court ruling, Japan cancelled its   hunt, only to resume it the following year under a new programme called   (New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean). It killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean  —   many of them pregnant, according to observers. The Southern Ocean hosts one of two whale sanctuaries in the world. The issue is a deeply divisive one at the biennial meetings of the IWC, which turned 70 this year. The meat from Japan’s hunts ends up on supermarket shelves and in restaurants, in line with an IWC stipulation that whales taken for research must be eaten. Under the IWC moratorium, all whaling other than for aboriginal subsistence, or science, is prohibited. Japan hunts under the science exemption, while Norway and Iceland lodged formal objections to the moratorium and continue commercial hunts. New Zealand’s commissioner Amy Laurenson expressed her country’s “deep disappointment” with Japan’s resumption of whaling without IWC approval. Japan had referred   to the IWC’s scientific committee, but started whaling before it could complete a review, she said, and accused Tokyo of sidelining the commission. “On the basis of the information the commission has before it, it is clear that   is not in fact for purposes of scientific research,” the commissioner argued, and called on Japan to “cease the lethal component of  ”. “Japan has still not justified the use of lethal sampling,” she said. For Kitty Block of the Humane Society International, Thursday’s vote shrank the scientific whaling “loophole”. “With its continued defiance and its unfettered whaling, Japan is not just killing whales but making itself a true outlier in the community of nations,” she said.",-0.5
"Intelligence Dems still in the dark about surveillance documents: lawmakers | TheHill. Frustrated Democrats from the House Intelligence Committee on Friday morning said they still have not seen intelligence from Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) that he says shows some form of potentially inappropriate surveillance or unmasking of Trump campaign associates. “Nothing — zero. He’s provided absolutely nothing,” ranking member Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said. “He’s not sharing what he told us yesterday he would share.” Asked if he was concerned Nunes was withholding information from Democrats, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) said, “Well, we haven’t got the information that he talked about the other day.” Nunes on Thursday morning apologized to committee Democrats for going public with the information before speaking to them — and promised to share information with the minority about his findings. According to Nunes, he saw the documents at the agency where they are housed. He has provided vague and at times contradictory answers as to whether Trump associates were directly involved, saying that he is waiting to receive more information from the National Security Agency (NSA). He told reporters Friday morning that the NSA was complying fully but that he did not expect to receive all of that documentation on Friday, as had been previously expected. Prior to Nunes’s startling disclosure earlier this week, Nunes and Schiff together had sent a joint request for information that the chair said Friday “should encompass everything that I’ve seen.” Among other things, the letter demands to know who in U.S. government requested or authorized the unmasking of anyone associated with the Trump campaign. “It is possible that we will receive documents from the NSA today as we have requested, but I want to caution that I don’t expect the entirety of everything that we need today,” Nunes said. At this point, Nunes appears to be the only lawmaker who has seen the intelligence documents that he says “alarmed” him enough to brief the president immediately.  Democrats are outraged by Nunes’s handling of his discovery and have called for an independent commission to take over the investigation. “It looks like he’s running his own intelligence service at this point. He’s collecting classified information and briefing the president,” Swalwell said. Minority members met behind closed doors on Friday morning to “figure out what’s next,” Swalwell said. In the past, they have threatened to walk away from the investigation if they feel that it is not being handled ethically. Quigley said that while some committee Democrats were frustrated enough to want to walk away, there was a recognition that if they do so, they would be completely cutting off their ability to influence the investigation. “The worst choice would be to leave the investigation, the lights would go out,” Quigley said. “Occasionally members in frustration will say something like that, but when the group gets together, they recognize what I just said.” But, he said, “We’re having a lot of WTF moments.”  View the discussion thread.

"Amazon says it will add 1,000 more employees in the UK, bringing the total to 28,500, bucking the Brexit chill – TechCrunch. A lot of uncertainty hangs over the U.K. as it continues its slow march out of the European Union, but today one of the world’s biggest companies announced plans to expand its presence in the country. Amazon today said it would add another 1,000 workers in the U.K., including establishing its first corporate and R&D office in Manchester. Amazon said it also plans to add more people to its R&D bases in Edinburgh and Cambridge — respectively known for developing search technology as well as the AI technology that powers Alexa, among other things. The company says it currently has 27,500 “roles” in the U.K. The government is positioning Amazon’s news as a win at a time when many have been criticising how it has been handling Brexit negotiations. “Ensuring that the world’s best and brightest companies continue to invest and innovate in the UK is at the heart of our Global Britain agenda,” said Secretary of State for International Trade, Liam Fox, in a statement. “Amazon’s decision to create hundreds of highly-skilled jobs in Manchester, Edinburgh and Cambridge is an enormous vote of confidence in the UK and a signal to the world that the UK is very much open for business.” The news was announced today as the company presented an “Innovation Day” to journalists, showcasing some of the different areas that are the focus of its R&D hubs in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and the U.K. I was at the event, and while I wouldn’t say the day was strong on news announcements around that work, it’s instructive to consider what Amazon chose to show (and perhaps not show, too). For example, in one demo the company showed off today, a new computer vision-based system Amazon is building in Berlin will allow robots to identify what produce is ripe or rotten so that automatic pickers can select more robust fruit and vegetables to pack off to consumers, and identify what needs to be discarded. This underscores the company’s ambitions in the business of fresh food sales and delivery. Earlier this summer there were reports that Amazon was interested in bidding for a number of large retail locations that were due to be shut down by Homebase, a DIY chain, so that it could set up more delivery (or perhaps even retail) spots across key U.K. cities. However, so far nothing has materialised. You might think it’s ironic for a company that’s announcing job creation is also creating tech that will help eliminate jobs, but Amazon is the very embodiment of giving with one hand, and taking with the other. The company earlier this month announced it would be increasing the minimum wage in its warehouses, but at the same time it also announced that it would be ceasing bonuses (it claimed it would be a net positive for employees). A walk through some of the company’s transportation work, meanwhile, focused more incremental developments rather than fundamental shifts for the company. The focus in the presentation was not on drones (which Amazon has also been building in Europe), nor on autonomous cars (which Amazon is also working on) but on its real-time street navigation services, and other tools to help delivery people make more accurate parcel drops. While Amazon is continuing to add employees in the U.K., it has also had its share of employment controversies. Warehouse workers regularly strike during the company’s busiest sales periods to protest working conditions. And earlier this month, Reuters reported that the company had built an AI prototype to assist with finding and screening suitable candidates to help make its hiring spree more efficient. But the project had to be scrapped after it was found to be biased against women (highlighting some of the problems with “training” in machine learning). The company is also among the tech giants that might finally be held to task over taxes, although the issue has become very long in the tooth over the years, such that it has not been resolved. In the latest development, the EU commissioner who oversees taxes said that he was working on a deal that could be finalised before the end of this year, which could bring in about €5 billion in tax revenues from companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook, based on their “digital” presence rather than physical presence — the loophole that has kept American internet companies from paying large taxes on their profits up to now. However, if a deal isn’t reached soon, it could be pushed back by a year, since Brexit is expected to sidetrack everything in 2019.",0.0
"’Pro-black, Activist’ Rachel Dolezal: ’Race is a Social Construct’ - Breitbart.

"My Lifelong Frizz-Ease Addiction.   was launched in 1989, only a few years before I hit puberty, and according to some estimates, one bottle is sold every 30 seconds around the world. The product, a   potion, promises to turn anyone’s tresses into glossy,   strands or   ramen noodles. The reality, of course, is more complicated. I came of age during the height of the Rachel, an impossibly sleek and angled hairdo that was the essential   look among my peers. Every time I went to the hair salon with my mother, I would dutifully flip through magazines searching desperately for an alternative, something on the Meg   Driver spectrum. But the truth is, I didn’t have the volume of either. Legend has it that I used to have tight spirals like them, but one day, around the age of five, I refused to brush my hair. A bowl was put on my head and my locks were chopped off, never to grow back the same way. According to my mother, that was when my baby curls loosened into waves. She still speaks of that day with regret. Thrust into a limbo of       hair, haircuts were incredibly emotional for me. The magazines only had two options: Julia   or Jennifer Aniston. Maybe it was the fumes in the   salon, but I always went for the part down the center, straight, angled option. They styled it for me at the salon, and I knew it would only look good for three days, maybe four if I skipped swim practice. I always told myself that this would be the time I would figure out how to use one of those giant, round brushes or master the flat iron with the same precision the     woman at the salon could. I tried brushing my hair 1, 000 times a night to make it sleek, like other girls in my class claimed to do, but that didn’t work. I experimented with my grandmother’s   gel and Aqua Net hairspray, but they just made my hair hard, like someone had taken a pencil and a compass and drawn fractals from my scalp. There wasn’t a girl on television (or in my Delia’s catalog) that looked like I did, but there were countless movies where   heroines were transformed into charming beauties by enchanted  . In high school, I overheard some girls talking about hair oil, so I poured   olive oil on my sister’s head, wrapped it in cellophane, and left it overnight. (Better to experiment on my sister first, I reasoned.) She woke up covered in acne, I was grounded, and it took a week for her hair to lose the   look (and smell). That’s what was so special about John Frieda’s creation: It came in a petite, unassuming clear bottle, felt soft to the touch and didn’t stink of desperation (or olives). It wasn’t a gel, it was a “serum,” and it didn’t contain ingredients, it was a patented “formula. ” My hair didn’t need a stylist, it needed a diagnosis. The advertisements’ medicinal language made me feel like I had finally found the cure —  and it was less than $10. It’s this magical thinking that has allowed John Frieda’s   empire to add shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, styling foam, and “10 Day Tamer  ” treatments to its eponymous line. I will be the first to admit that I’ve tried them all. The average woman spends $50, 000 on hair care in her lifetime.   was my gateway drug: I spent thousands on creams, sprays, foams, irons, and cuts that promise curl control. None of them really worked, but I had been successfully convinced that my hair was defective. I needed a product to be presentable, to be desirable, to be taken seriously —  it was just a matter of finding the right one. All the other women in my family suffered from this same illness Thanksgiving was a verifiable   convention, with cousins, aunts, and matriarchs all bringing new concoctions for everyone to try on our big, bouncy, Jewish hair. Scientific studies and unscientific polls all show that this isn’t some imaginary insecurity either: Women are judged based on how their hair looks. Straight hair is considered more professional than curly hair, long hair communicates youthfulness and reproductive health, and black women are openly discriminated against by employers who say their hair looks “messy. ” It wasn’t until college that I stopped struggling with my mane and just let it do its thing. By that time, there were salons that specialized in curly hair, and celebrities besides Ms. Frizzle who wore their locks au naturale. Even John Frieda started creating products that worked with curls of all kinds instead of stifling them. But taking care of my curly hair, even when I finally figured out how to do it, was exhausting. I had to wash, set, and dry it every morning. I had to alternate products every few months to avoid   dandruff disasters and itchy scalp. I had to buy     shampoo. I had to find a hairdresser who understood cutting one inch of wet hair meant cutting two inches of dry hair (and who, blessedly, also served Pabst Blue Ribbon to take the edge off). Eventually, I gave up. I wear it straight now, even though I know that makes me a traitor. My curly hair was defiant, political, wild —  an expression of my true self. My straight locks are a reminder that I’ve succumbed to societal norms, that   and all it represented, finally won. There is no easy, $10 antidote to erasing the hair you were born with. There is, however, a $95,   keratin treatment at a poorly ventilated salon on the Upper East Side that will turn the most unruly of tresses into plain,   hair. That’s where I surrender, for four to six months at a time.",-0.5
"Ex-CIA chief: Worries grew of Trump campaign contacts to Russia.  Former CIA director John Brennan said on Tuesday he had noticed contacts between associates of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 election and grew concerned Moscow had sought to lure Americans down ”a treasonous path.” Brennan, who headed the agency until Trump became president in January, also told a congressional hearing that he personally warned the head of Russia’s FSB security service in a phone call last August that meddling in the election would hurt relations with the United States. Separately, the top U. S. intelligence official, Dan Coats, sidestepped a question on a Washington Post report that Trump had asked him and the National Security Agency chief to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did say he has made clear to Trump’s administration that ”any political shaping” of intelligence would be inappropriate. The comments by Brennan and Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, added fuel to a controversy that has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago amid the agency’s investigation into possible collusion between people associated with his presidential campaign and Russia. ”I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U. S. persons involved in the Trump campaign,” Brennan’s said in testimony to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Brennan said that he cannot say definitively there was actual collusion. Brennan’s testimony was the first public confirmation of the worry at high levels of the U. S. government last year over suspicious contacts between Trump campaign associates and Moscow. It was also the most complete account to date of the CIA’s thinking at a time when intelligence agencies were putting together evidence that Russia was interfering in the heated U. S. presidential race to help businessman Trump, a Republican, defeat Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Comey was heading the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Russian interference and possible collusion with Trump’s campaign, leading to accusations by Trump critics that he has sought to curtail the FBI inquiry. In another development, Trump has retained Marc Kasowitz, a New   trial lawyer who has represented Trump in the past, as his private attorney for special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Russia matter, a Fox Business Network reporter said on Twitter. U. S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in Trump’s favor, including by hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegation. Trump has denied any collusion but the FBI and congressional probes into the Russia matter have dogged the early months of his presidency. ”It should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so,” Brennan said. Brennan said he worried that Russians tried to recruit Americans during the presidential campaign to work for Moscow. Brennan said it was possible for someone to be helpful to the Russian cause without realizing it. ”They (the Russians) try to suborn individuals and they try to get individuals, including U. S. persons, to act on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly,” he said, adding that ”individuals going on a treasonous path often do not realize it until it is too late.” ’WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION’ Republican Representative Trey Gowdy asked Brennan: ”Did you see evidence of collusion, coordination and conspiracy between Donald Trump and Russian state actors?” ”I saw information and intelligence that was worthy of investigation by the bureau (FBI) to determine whether or not such cooperation or collusion was taking place,” Brennan replied, but declined to elaborate. Reuters reported last week that Trump’s fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn and other advisers to Trump’s campaign were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. Flynn was forced out in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Brennan said he believed he was the first U. S. official to raise the matter of election interference with the Russians, citing an Aug. 4, 2016 phone call he had with the head of Russia’s FSB, Alexander Bortnikov. He said he raised media reports of Russian attempts to meddle in the election with Bortnikov, who denied any involvement by Moscow, and told him if Russia pursued this course it would destroy prospects for improved U. S.  relations. Trump’s public approval ratings dropped to a new low in   poll data released on Tuesday, with 37 percent of U. S. adults surveyed approving of the president while 57 percent disapproving. Support for Trump appears to have dropped among Americans of all political stripes. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Coats sidestepped questions about a Washington Post report that Trump had asked Coats and Admiral Michael Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, to help him knock down the notion that there was evidence of such collusion. But Coats did not deny Trump had made such a request. Coats said that ”I don’t feel it’s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president.” The Post reported Coats and Rogers declined the request. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told Coats that the fact he had not denied the Post report should lead to ”even more intensive investigation of the alleged effort by the president to enlist you in shutting down, or stifling that investigation.” ”This evidence, if true, goes to criminal intent and constitutes mounting evidence of obstruction of justice,” Blumenthal added. The leaders of the U. S. Senate Intelligence Committee said they will subpoena two of Flynn’s businesses after he declined to comply with a subpoena for documents in the panel’s Russia probe.

"The Yule Log Channel – TechCrunch. My aunt and uncle lived up the hill from Martins Ferry, Ohio, high above the river. My uncle ran a used car lot — Snezek’s — and so it was understood that they had a little bit of money and a bigger house than the rest of the family in the Valley. We would drive there every year at Christmas; first the two and a half hours to Martins Ferry, a pit-stop at my grandmother’s, and then a drive up the woods that covered the winding upper roads like a dark cloud. These were family gatherings before distractions, before everyone carried their lives with them in their pocket, so you had to prepare. I always brought a few books or some Christmas presents to play with. One year I brought my entire Dungeons & Dragons set in an effort to learn how to play — even though I had no one to play with. We’d shiver in the backseat as we wound up the hill. House windows faced us, candles aglow. White glowing reindeer and sleighs peeked between pines. At the house we’d coast into the driveway and hop out into the crystalline cold. A few steps more and we would be warm. Walking into the house through the door next to the garage, into the warmth of a home fired with cooking and laughter, is one of my fondest memories. The family made pierogi and lasagna, two staples in the pot-luck rotation of those old coal and steel towns. There would be plates of cookies and plenty of ginger ale and Buckeyes, the best candy on earth. There were jars of pretzels and nuts here and there, a sprinkling of gumdrops or hard candy for the old folks. There was fried chicken someone made and wedding soup my mother made. As you walked into that warm place you heard the clack of billiard balls and the roar of the game in the other room. My dad cracked a beer. I got kissed by my aunts a few times and then hid, perhaps in a corner or maybe upstairs by their big tree in a darkened room lit only by a fire roaring on a tube television. That was the height of interactivity, then: a live fire on TV (or, more likely, a looped fire). You imagined what it must be like on the other end of that picture, how much technology you needed to make something so primal and imperative appear on a glass tube. It was as if we had traversed space into a strange craft outfitted with the comforts of home and none of the discomforts. Nestled on the couch, the TV crackling, you were on a space station and safe, a self-sufficient place where memories of cold were far distant. They aired the first Yule log in 1966 from New York’s Gracie Mansion. By the time I was watching it had been around for 20 years. It was a holdover from the early days of broadcast, from the days when the air was dead if there was no one to play in front of the cameras. In a few years the tradition would vanish, but in 2001, in the wake of 9/11, it came back, a reminder of simpler times. There was something about it that could change your outlook. A distant roaring fire was almost as good as one in the house, and far less work. I’d curl up, read, and nod off, the voices of the adults below lulling me to sleep. Now we carry things that burn brightly in our pockets. We don’t need these camera tricks to see fires everywhere. We don’t curl up to the magnet hum of a cathode ray tube and the tinny crackle and pop of facsimile logs. We’re beyond that. Maybe we aren’t, though. Maybe there’s still a warm place, the umbilicus to get there a crystalline moment between the backseat of a car and warm basement rec room. And maybe upstairs there’s a dozing kid watching the last drops of Christmas burn away into the country dark. I think there still is. I hope there still is. Merry Christmas.",0.0
"NFL Network Warns Staffers to Steer Clear of Politics on Social Media. As more and more sports fans call for members of the sports media to “stick to sports,” news has leaked that the NFL Network is now warning employees to avoid talking about politics on their social media accounts. [While ESPN continues to spiral into pure   politics, the NFL Network seems ready to avoid the cable sports network’s troubles, Sports Business Daily reported.  NFL executives are becoming alarmed by the volatility of mixing politics with sports and see it as a sort of “  scenario. ” So, network execs are saying “avoid politics. ” “Those debates are healthy in the middle of newsrooms and discussions  ” NFL Network’s executive producer of studio and remote content, Mike Muriano, said. “But playfully or not, what happens in    conversations can be construed in ways that you don’t want on a public forum like Twitter  —   especially when it comes to politics. ” Execs essentially want employees to “stick to sports. ” One message the NFL gave its talent was to be cognizant that people follow them for their football knowledge. “When in doubt, keep it to the game,” NFL’s vice president of social media and emerging programming, Tom Brady said. “There’s always a time to showcase your personality and be able to engage with fans and go outside of your core. But at the end of the day, as a member of the NFL Media Group, try to stick to football because that’s what people want to hear from you about. ” “Talent needs to be careful with that level of engagement,” Muriano said. “Be smart and sensitive to if you’re getting trolled or not. Then just stop. “Our talent, as the known quantity in this exchange, does not benefit by dressing down a fan  —   even if that fan is way off base. At some point, they have to know when to say that this has taken a turn and I’m not taking part anymore. ” “There is a danger to unfiltered messages that can be delivered to a mass audience immediately. The league told its   talent to use common sense when posting on social media,” the NFL Network told employees. “Don’t fail the social media IQ test,” Muriano concluded. “Is what you’re about to put out there that important? Give it a second thought. ” With the troubles of ESPN as a guide, it is no wonder that NFL Network execs want their employees to avoid the pitfalls of angering millions of customers with constant   political pronouncements.

"German government agrees tighter asylum rules.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and their   Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners agreed on Thursday to tighten asylum rules, reaching a compromise on how to stem an influx of migrants that topped one million last year. The new measures include a   ban on family reunions for asylum seekers who are granted limited refugee protection and speeding up the deportations of failed applicants, said Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, announcing the deal. A dispute over tighter immigration rules has been straining  the ruling coalition, which includes Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and their   Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party, as well Gabriel’s SPD. All three parties are eager to show voters that, despite deep divisions, the government is in control of the refugee crisis before three state votes in March and a general election next year. ”The mood is good,” Gabriel told reporters, signaling unity among the three parties after weeks of tension over CSU leader Horst Seehofer’s threat to take Merkel’s government to court if his demand to stem the flow of asylum seekers is not met.  The new rules, which have been in the works since November and entail a program for integrating refugees, also include speeding up the process for applicants from   safe countries and reducing financial support for asylum seekers. Merkel, whose popularity has slumped over her handling of the crisis, is also holding a meeting with the heads of Germany’s 16 states who are demanding more government funds for German courses, schools, kindergartens and policing. German towns and cities say the influx of 1. 1 million asylum seekers last year is pushing their resources to the limit and they would not be able to accommodate more newcomers if the numbers do not go down. The number of asylum seekers crossing the German border from Austria every day fell to some 700 over the last several days from more than 2, 000 earlier in the year. German officials say the decrease is linked to winter and warn of a spike in spring. This is the second bundle of asylum measures agreed by the government, which pushed a first package of tighter immigration rules in October. Gabriel said that while tightening the rules to discourage migrants from reaching Germany illegally, the government wanted to bring Syrian refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordan. The government also wants to designate Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as safe countries to facilitate the deportation of applicants from those countries. Morocco announced on Thursday that it had agreed to repatriate illegal migrants from Germany.

"Men-Only Swimming At Public Luton Pool A ’Cultural Thing’. A public swimming pool in Luton is holding   swimming sessions on a Friday, with staff stating it is a “cultural thing”. [Bathers were given sudden notice that from the 29th of July the competitive pool at Inspire Sports Village in Luton would be closed to women on Friday evenings for “cultural”reasons.  Men would have sole access to the larger 50m pool, which was built using   funded Olympic grants, while women are expected to use the smaller 20m community pool. Female bathers were allegedly told by staff that if they did not want to use the community pool they were advised to use either Lea Manor or Lewsey pools  —   both nearly ten miles away from Inspire. When a female swimmer asked a member of staff at the pool why   swimming had been introduced, she was told it was a “cultural thing”. The woman told Luton Today: “Why has one section of the community in Luton been allowed to dominate and take over the best pool in the borough?” Referring to the large Muslim community, which accounts for 25% of the town’s population. “I like swimming in the competition pool after a hard week at work on Fridays and now I can’t without any discussion and very little advanced notice. ” The   swimming event has been advertised as “Alhamdulliah Swimming” (a Muslim phrase meaning “Praise be to Allah”) by a group on Facebook referred to as ‘The Strong Believer’. The group administrator posted last week: “Alhamdulliah swimming is back! We have the large 50 metre pool on a permanent basis. Starts this Friday inshallah [Allah willing]. Please share with all friends and family. ” The segregated swimming appears to have been a programme that existed previously at the pool in 2015, which has been revived again this year  —   and on a permanent basis. Last year, when the swimming was held on Sundays, posters advertised that the “awrah (navel to knee) must be covered. No swimming trunks”. Gender segregated swimming is already becoming the norm in European countries such as Sweden. Pools offer separate swimming hours for men and women to accommodate for the Muslim population in heavily Muslim areas such as the city of Malmö, as well as a hundred other Swedish municipalities. A spokesman from Active Luton defended the move and explained that on Friday evenings Inspire offered   swimming sessions. “We regularly provide opportunities for different groups in our programme, including many different activities and swimming sessions. “Active Luton aims to provide everyone in our community, regardless of age, ability or ethnicity, with affordable and accessible opportunities to get active in ways which suit their   needs and lifestyles. ”",1.0
"As the LA venture market booms, Upfront closes its sixth fund with $400 million – TechCrunch. Los Angeles is the third-largest market for venture capital investment in the United States, with $4.2 billion invested in the last year alone, and it’s perhaps the market where capital commitments are increasing at the fastest pace. With the public offering of Snap, and the billion-dollar exits for both Dollar Shave Club and QLogic, the city has also proven to be a place where investors are posting real returns. So it’s no wonder that one of Los Angeles’ oldest venture firms, Upfront Ventures, was able to close on $400 million for its sixth fund. The city is booming, and the blistering pace at which Upfront was able to close the fund (from launch to close within two-and-a-half months, according to managing partner, Mark Suster), is just another sign that the technology scene in Los Angeles is ascendant. Indeed, at the firm’s Upfront Summit, an invite-only affair for investors, entrepreneurs, tastemakers and celebrities held earlier this year, Suster managed to wrangle celebrity entrepreneurs and investors like Kobe Bryant, Baron Davis, Tyra Banks and Gwyneth Paltrow (and the mayor) to pitch the wonders of Los Angeles to the investment community. The $400 million oversubscribed fund is the largest ever raised in the city, Suster said, noting that the close brings the firms total assets under management to $2 billion. “LA has truly arrived,” Suster tells me. “In the past people were reluctant to see a really big VC in LA.” Roughly 45 percent of the capital from the new fund will likely be deployed in Los Angeles and Southern California, Suster said. Indeed, a number of early-stage and Series A-focused investment vehicles will likely feed into the already bulging ecosystem of strong startup companies. Suster declined to comment on the performance of the firm’s latest fund, but did say that its second fund was the best performing fund of its vintage, with investments in BillMeLater, Overture and Investnet. Now with big bets on Ring, Loot Crate, GOAT and TrueCar, there’s been a shift toward more consumer-focused offerings that can leverage what Tyra Banks has called Los Angeles’ “silicon reach.” What limited partners were drawn to, in the fund’s latest closing, was its track record. “What they saw was differentiation and performance,” said Suster. “A fund formed in Silicon Valley is competing for deal with every other manager.” While the size of the fund has expanded, Upfront has also expanded its team, meaning the focus of the firm’s investments will remain on seed and Series A round investors. “Almost 90 percent of the deals are seed capital and Series A,” Suster said. Five years ago the firm had four partners, and now the firm employs six partners — including new addition Kobie Fuller, who came to Upfront from Accel in the past year. Now the firm’s investment partners include founder Yves Sisteron, Greg Bettinelli, Kara Nortman, Fuller, Suster, and Kevin Zhang. Stuart Lander is the firm’s partner in charge of operations and platform teams for the firm. Upfront Ventures managing partner Mark Suster and founder Yves Sisteron Upfront Ventures managing partner Mark Suster and founder Yves Sisteron For Suster, Upfront’s success is a function of a broader trend toward the geographical dispersion of successful investment funds throughout the U.S. Pointing to Bijan Sabet’s Spark Capital in Boston, to Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures in New York and Philadelphia’s First Round Capital helmed by Josh Kopelman, Suster noted that the diversification of venture is more than just a consequence of geography. In a city like Los Angeles, which graduates more engineers than any other American urban center, and which has a broad, diverse background, gender and racial diversity are just as important to a firm’s success as the capital it raises. Suster underscored the importance of this in his own blog post about the fund’s close, writing: Upfront has long held the view that with regards to equality we should DO more than SAY but the events of the last weeks have led us to want to verbalize more our deep-seated commitment to equality in funding founders across ethnicities, nationalities and genders. We believe this isn’t just a market statement — it is where we will drive huge and differentiated returns. Dating back to Upfront II in 2000 (the single best performing fund in the US for that vintage) 2 of our 3 best returns were driven by companies with female founders / CEOs. More recently reports have come out listing VC firms ranked by percentage of female founders where we’re usually listed in the top 5% nationally. In our most recent fund ~30% of the companies we’ve backed have had at least one of the primary founders as a woman. As the firm looks ahead to its own future, Suster and the firm he’s helped grow remain committed to the future of Los Angeles. The two are paired and these days, if an investor is #LongLA (to use the hashtag the firm coined), it looks like limited partners are saying that it pays to be long on Upfront, as well.",0.0
"NYT Says St. Paul Ordered Christians to ‘Execute’ Homosexuals. The New York Times’ sloppiness when reporting on Christianity is proverbial, but perhaps none of its prior errors equals its claim this week that the apostle Saint Paul commanded Christians to kill the homosexuals among them. [With remarkable insouciance, NYT writers Jeremy W. Peters and Lizette Alvarez blithely make reference to “a Bible verse from Romans that calls for the execution of gays,” meaning Saint Paul’s letter to the Romans 1: .  As anyone who has ever read the New Testament knows, Saint Paul never permits that Christians should commit any violence whatsoever against homosexuals, but the Times editors apparently thought that   with the original text was superfluous or that readers were too ignorant to check for themselves. The Times report, titled “After Orlando, a Political Divide on Gay Rights Still Stands,” follows on the fatal shooting of 49 people in the Pulse nightclub by a    Muslim who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. In the wake of the attack, many have tried to compare Christian beliefs regarding the morality of homosexuality with those of Islam, in an apparent attempt to make Christians guilty by association. The biblical passage in question actually speaks of God’s anger toward sinners who reject God despite the abundance of evidence for his existence in creation. It says that those who failed to honor God “became futile in their thinking, and their senseless minds were darkened. ” Saint Paul continues: “Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves. ” “For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions. Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error,” he wrote. The passage ends with a list of the sort of behavior that displeased God: They were filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, craftiness, they are gossips, slanderers,   insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, rebellious towards parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. They know God’s decree, that those who practice such things deserve to die —  yet they not only do them but even applaud others who practice them. Last week Republican Congressman read this passage aloud to his colleagues, incurring the wrath of gay rights advocates who called on Republicans to condemn the “vile and dangerous remarks” contained in the biblical text. “At a time when LGBT people face staggering rates of discrimination, harassment and violence, Representative Allen’s comments spread hate that does real harm,” Human Rights Campaign Senior Vice President said in a statement. Wishing to censor the Bible as “hate speech,” however, would establish a dangerous precedent for religious liberty in America, a nation founded on   principles, especially when the text in question condemns a whole series of actions that few manage to avoid. The New York Times, which prides itself on its careful reporting, has a history of blunders when addressing Christianity. In 2006, journalist Terry Mattingly wrote a column titled “Reporters, Crow’s Ears and Karma Light Nuns,” which documented a series of factual errors made by journalists when reporting on religion, beginning with the   gaffe by Ian Fisher, who referred to Pope John Paul’s metal staff as a “crow’s ear,” instead of the correct term of “crozier. ” In fairness, the New York Times isn’t the only group that has sought to implicate Christian teaching on homosexuality in the Orlando massacre. The Catholic bishop of Saint Petersburg, Fla, similarly blamed Catholic disapproval of homosexual acts for the brutal Orlando slaughter. In a blogpost, Bishop Robert Lynch said that Catholicism “targets” and “often breeds contempt for gays, lesbians and transgender people. ” The seed of contempt, he said, turns into hatred, “which can ultimately lead to violence. ” Unless this attitude changes, he states, “we can expect more Orlandos. ” Follow Thomas D.

"U.S. top court backs New Jersey cop’s political retaliation claim.  The U. S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a former police detective can sue a New Jersey city claiming he was demoted as punishment after getting a campaign sign for his bedridden mother supporting the mayor’s rival in a 2006 local election. The court, in its   ruling, found that Jeffrey Heffernan, a now former member of Paterson’s police force, was not in fact exercising his rights to freedom of association under the U. S. Constitution’s First Amendment because he picked up the sign for his mother and not himself. But the justices decided he could sue the city for violating those rights because the boss who demoted him believed, albeit mistakenly, that Heffernan supported the mayor’s opponent. ”We conclude that . .. the government’s reason for demoting Heffernan is what counts here,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the court. ”When an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the First Amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action . .. even if, as here, the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee’s behavior.” The high court reversed a 2015 ruling by the   3rd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing Heffernan’s lawsuit on the grounds that a First Amendment retaliation claim cannot be based on an employer’s perception of a worker’s actions. The day before Heffernan was demoted, an aide to Jose Torres, Paterson’s mayor at the time who was running for   saw Heffernan getting a large campaign sign backing another mayoral candidate. Heffernan said he got the sign while   as a favor for his mother after her previous sign had been stolen from her front yard, and that the sign did not reflect his personal preference in the mayoral election. The next day, the police department demoted him from detective and transferred him to the traffic division’s walking squad, a move he saw as political retaliation. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing that Heffernan should not be able to sue regardless of whether his demotion was misguided or wrong because he had not been exercising his constitutional rights.

"Lead-Laced Water In Flint: A Step-By-Step Look At The Makings Of A Crisis. Lead seepage into the drinking water in Flint, Mich. has caused a massive public health crisis and prompted President Obama to declare a federal state of emergency there. The problem began when the city switched its water supply in 2014. Almost immediately, residents of Flint  —   a   city where 40 percent of people live in poverty  —   started complaining about the quality of the water. City and state officials denied for months that there was a serious problem. By that time, supply pipes had sustained major corrosion and lead was leaching into the water. The city switched back to its original water supply late last year, but it was too late to reverse the damage to the pipes. High blood lead levels are especially harmful to children and pregnant women, and can cause ”learning disabilities, behavioral problems and mental retardation,” the World Health Organization says. Here’s how the crisis unfolded: Flint officials explore whether the city can save money by switching from its current provider, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD). City and state officials weigh an alternative: Flint could build its own pipeline to connect to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA). That option was projected to save the region $200 million over 25 years, according to City Council meeting minutes. On April 16, Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz tells the state treasurer that the city is going to join the KWA. A day later, Detroit’s water system tells Kurtz it is terminating service to the city effective a year later, in April 2014. Until Flint’s pipeline connecting to the KWA is operational, the city needs an interim source of water and turns to the Flint River, which was also its main water source until the 1960s. Flint River water starts flowing to the city on April 25. In a press release, the city characterized it as a temporary switch and aimed to ease resident concerns about the water quality. Here’s an excerpt: ”Even with a proven track record of providing perfectly good water for Flint, there still remains lingering uncertainty about the quality of the water. In an effort to dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River and its viability as a residential water resource, there have been numerous studies and tests conducted on its water by several independent organizations. . .. Michael Prysby of the Michigan DEQ Office of Drinking Water verified that ’the quality of the water being put out meets all of our drinking water standards and Flint water is safe to drink.’ . .. ” ’It’s regular, good, pure drinking water, and it’s right in our backyard,’ said Mayor [Dayne] Walling, ”this is the first step in the right direction for Flint, and we take this monumental step forward in controlling the future of our community’s most precious resource.’ ” Officials did not immediately treat the Flint River water to ensure it didn’t cause corrosion in the pipes  —   instead, they took what Michigan Radio characterized as a ”  ” approach. Some Flint residents complain about the smell and color of the new water, which is 70 percent harder than its previous water source, according to MLive. E. coli and total coliform bacteria are detected in Flint’s water, prompting multiple advisories for residents to boil their water. An informational document from Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) says the city addressed the problem by increasing chlorine levels in the water. General Motors says it will stop using Flint River water, fearing corrosion in its machines. ”Because of all the metal . .. you don’t want the higher chlorine water (to result in) corrosion,” GM spokesman Tom Wickham tells MLive. ”We noticed it some time ago (and) the discussions have been going on for some time.” Flint is found to be in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act because of the level of total trihalomethanes, or TTHM, in the water. TTHM are disinfection byproducts that occur when chlorine interacts with organic matter in the water. Some types are possible carcinogens for humans, the CDC says. In response, the state starts buying bottled water for its employees at government offices. This continues even after TTHM levels returned to compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act in September 2015, MLive reported. A city test ”reveals high lead content in the water of a Flint resident’s home.” As Michigan Radio reported, the water at Lee Anne Walters’ home ”turns up with a lead content of 104 parts per billion. Fifteen parts per billion is the [Environmental Protection Agency]’s limit for lead in drinking water.” In April, Walters says her child was diagnosed with lead poisoning. An independent test done by Virginia Tech researchers finds lead levels at 13, 200 ppb  —   water is considered hazardous waste at 5, 000 ppb. The EPA says it was notified by the MDEQ on or about April 24 ”that the City did not have corrosion control treatment in place at the Flint Water Treatment Plant.” A leaked internal memo from the EPA expresses concern about lead levels, including the level at Lee Anne Walters’ home. The ACLU picks up the report. Michigan Radio reaches out to the MDEQ for comment about the memo, and spokesman Brad Wurfel says, ”Let me start here  —   anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax.” He adds that he hasn’t seen the memo, but that preliminary tests show the Walters test was an ”outlier.” Wurfel tells Michigan Radio, ”It does not look like there is any broad problem with the water supply freeing up lead as it goes to homes.” The MDEQ dropped two samples from its initial report on lead levels from the city, which put the result within federally mandated levels. ”If the state had just dropped one high sample, Flint still would have been over the federal action level,” Michigan Radio reports. ”But dropping two samples put them below the action level.” Officials said the two samples did not meet federal criteria  —   because one of the samples had a water filter and another came from a business rather than a home, Michigan Radio reports. A team from Virginia Tech tests hundreds of homes for lead in Flint, and says that ”preliminary tests show ’serious’ levels of lead in city water.” ”The levels that we have seen in Flint are some of the worst that I have seen in more than 25 years working in the field,” Dr. Marc Edwards, a member of the Virginia Tech team, tells Michigan Radio. Officials such as MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel dismiss the Virginia Tech results. He tells Michigan Radio: ”I don’t know how they’re getting the results they’re getting. . .. I know that it doesn’t match with any of the other surveillance in the area.” In an email to MLive journalist Ron Fonger, Wurfel says: ”It’s scientifically probable a research team that specializes in looking for lead in water could have found it in Flint when the city was on its old water supply. We won’t know that, because they’ve only just arrived in town and quickly proven the theory they set out to prove, and while the state appreciates academic participation in this discussion, offering broad, dire public health advice based on some quick testing could be seen as fanning political flames irresponsibly. Residents of Flint concerned about the health of their community don’t need more of that.” In a September interview with NPR, Edwards says: ”Flint is the only city in America that I’m aware of that does not have a corrosion control plan.” A study from the local Hurley Medical Center found that 2. 1 percent of children age 5 and under had elevated blood lead levels prior to the switch to Flint River water, compared to 4. 0 percent after the switch. A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said the elevated lead level results may be a result of seasonal changes, rather than the change in the water source. Flint issues a lead advisory to residents. ”While the City is in full compliance with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, this information is being shared as part of a public awareness campaign to ensure that everyone takes note that no level of lead is considered safe,” it reads. That same day, Gov. Snyder’s chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, writes in an email that the MDEQ and Department of Community Health ”feel that some in Flint are taking the very sensitive issue of children’s exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political football claiming the departments are underestimating the impacts on the population and particularly trying to shift responsibility to the state.” An action plan released by Snyder says the city and state will provide free filters and water testing for Flint residents, among other things. Flint switches back to the Detroit water supplier, which is now called the Great Lakes Water Authority. The governor’s office said in press briefing notes that the Detroit water ”will be easier to manage. It comes from a more stable source than the river, it is fully optimized for corrosion control, and it is clear that residents of Flint have more confidence in this water source.” In an email to a Detroit News reporter, MDEQ Director Dan Wyant discusses why there were no corrosion controls in place when the city started using Flint River water. He seems to chalk up the lack of corrosion controls to a misunderstanding: ”What has become clear in recent weeks is that the staff believed they were handling the situation in accordance with the proper protocol for a water provider using a new source, but the federal Lead and Copper rule has a particular provision for communities over 50, 000 people that the system operator must continue treating with full corrosion control even as they test the water. ”What the staff did would have been the proper protocol for a community under 50, 000 people. None of the DEQ staff in this division had ever worked on a water source switch for a community over 50, 000 people  —   it’s uncommon for big communities to switch sources. ”It’s increasingly clear there was confusion here, but it also is increasingly that DEQ staff believed they were using the proper federal protocol here and they were not.” Wyant adds that lime had been added to the water but provided ”insufficient corrosion control.” A December email from Snyder’s communications director, Meegan Holland, also said that Flint never tested the impact of the Flint River water on the distribution system. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declares a state of emergency over the elevated lead levels in the city’s water. ”I am requesting that all things be done necessary to address this state of emergency declaration, effective immediately,” Weaver tells the City Council, according to MLive. Weaver, who vowed to fix the water crisis, beat out incumbent Dayne Walling in an election the previous month. MDEQ Director Dan Wyant and spokesperson Brad Wurfel resign, MLive reports. This comes a day after the Flint Water Advisory Task Force, created by the governor, releases a preliminary report on the crisis and concludes that primary responsibility rests with the MDEQ. The report says that in the agency’s interactions with the public about their concerns, its response ”was often one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved.” Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder declares a state of emergency in Genesee County due to the lead in Flint’s drinking water. President Obama declared a state of emergency less than two weeks later. The move ”means FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to the people affected. Federal funding will help cover the cost of providing water, water filters and other items,” as we reported. The EPA issues an emergency order to take action on the Flint water crisis. ”EPA has determined that the City of Flint’s and the State of Michigan’s responses to the drinking water crisis in Flint have been inadequate and that these failures continue,” the emergency order reads. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hears testimony from several Flint officials and experts. But much attention has focused on who wasn’t testifying at the hearing: Gov. Snyder and city emergency managers who presided over the change in Flint’s water supply. Snyder, along with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, testifies before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ”Let me be blunt,” the governor says in his opening statement. ”This was a failure of government at all levels. Local, state and federal officials  —   we all failed the families of Flint.” Snyder outlines state agencies’ goals in addressing the Flint crisis. The action plan includes providing professional support for children under 6 with elevated lead levels, replacing water fixtures in public facilities, replacing the city’s 8, 000 lead service lines, and increasing resources for schools. Supporting its preliminary conclusion, the task force charged with investigating the causes of the Flint water crisis says in its final report that the MDEQ bears primary responsibility. Task force member Chris Kolb tells reporters: ”From a regulatory standpoint, to a protection of human health and the environment standpoint, they missed the boat completely. And it is extremely troublesome to me that an agency whose primary role, once again, is to protect human health and the environment came to these decisions, and they never backed off these decisions, no matter how many red flags they saw.” Others are also to blame, the report says, including the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, the city’s emergency managers and the governor. Despite improved lead levels in Flint’s water, it remains unsafe to drink without a filter, according to results released from Virginia Tech researchers. (Though Gov. Snyder later pledged to drink filtered Flint water for 30 days.) That’s partially because residents have been using very little of the tainted water. As the   has reported, ”in an unfortunate cycle, the water additives that would ’ ’ corroded pipes in the water system, thereby preventing lead from leaching into the water, are not reaching the pipes because people in Flint don’t want to pay for contaminated water that they can’t use.” MLive reports that in December, Flint began adding phosphates to the water that would ”rebuild the protective coating inside transmission lines.” Michigan’s attorney general, Bill Schuette, announces that three people will face charges  —   the first criminal charges leveled against officials over the lead crisis. Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby are state officials at the MDEQ. City employee Michael Glasgow is Flint’s water quality supervisor. As the   reported, the three ”face felony charges including misconduct, neglect of duty and conspiracy to tamper with evidence. They’ve also been charged with violating Michigan’s Safe Drinking Water Act.” Schuette announced that his office is suing two companies involved in Flint’s crisis, and he says the damages could reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Veolia, a French company, was hired by the city as a   consultant in 2015.   firm Lockwood, Andrews  Newnam was originally hired in 2011 and helped to operate the water treatment plant using the Flint River. The civil lawsuit accuses both firms of negligence and public nuisance, and also accused Veolia of fraud. ”In Flint, Veolia and LAN were hired to do a job and failed miserably,” Schuette told reporters at a news conference. ”They failed miserably in their job  —   basically botched it, didn’t stop the water in Flint from being poisoned. They made it worse, that’s what they did.” Schuette announced criminal charges against six more current and former state employees, bringing the total number of people charged to nine. Liane   is the former director of the drinking water and municipal assistance office within the MDEQ. She and two subordinates, Adam Rosenthal and Patrick Cook, allegedly misled officials about Flint’s water treatment plant, which was not in compliance with lead and copper rules. The other three people charged are current or former employees of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The director of the child health unit, Nancy Peeler, her subordinate, Robert Scott, and a state epidemiologist Corinne Miller allegedly failed to release a report that showed unsafe lead levels in the blood of Flint children. All six are charged with misconduct in office, conspiracy, and willful neglect of duty. Rosenthal is also charged with tampering with evidence, for allegedly requesting water tests that did not show elevated lead.",-0.5
"Trump hands mic to supporter at Florida rally.  (CNN) In what appeared to be an improvised moment, President Donald Trump invited one of his supporters to join him on stage and take the microphone during a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on Saturday night. As the man climbed up, the President addressed security concerns by saying to the crowd, and perhaps to Secret Service agents, ”I’m not worried about him. I’m only worried he’s going to give me a kiss. I’m not worried about anything else.” Gene Huber, wearing a black Donald Trump   hugged the President and spoke for a few moments. ”Mr. President, thank you so, sir. We the people, our movement is the reason why our president of the United States is standing here in front of us today,” Huber said. ”When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.” ”A star is born,” Trump said as Huber returned to the crowd. ”I wouldn’t say that the Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others.” Later, Huber was interviewed by CNN’s Pamela Brown and said he’d been waiting since 4 a. m. ET to get into the rally. He believed Trump chose him to climb on stage after watching his interviews with TV reporters before the rally. Huber said Trump inspires him so that he keeps a   cardboard cutout of the President in his house. ”I salute that every single day and I pray and I tell him, ’Mr. President, I pray for your safety today,’ ” Huber said. ”And I’m not lying, I do that every single day to the president, but he’s cardboard.” He posted a photo of the cutout on Twitter, saying: ”The Best Vistor I could ever have! President Trump came to Florida to see me! Wow, never will forget this! @realDonaldTrump @thebestcloser” As the interview with Brown wrapped up, Huber asked, ”And can I just say one quick thing?” ”Quickly,” Brown replied. ”I appreciate the interview,” Huber said. ”Let’s just be a little, little nicer to our president. Thank you so much.”",-1.0
"Cameraperson review - a beautifully curated collage of outtakes. Spend 25 years on any job and you’re bound to have a little down time. Kirsten Johnson has worked for decades as a cinematographer on many acclaimed documentaries, travelling to places such as Bosnia, Darfur, Kabul and Texas. Wisely, she always kept her camera running and didn’t throw away the spare footage. By collecting and curating “leftover stock” for her experimental film Cameraperson, she has made more than just a record of “what I did at the office”. It is a remarkable document about the creative process in the service of a specific goal. It may even tap into a richer vein: what it’s like to live on planet Earth. Mostly a collection of scattered vignettes, Cameraperson differentiates itself from other grand “this is what the world is like” collages. Trailing a shepherd in rural Bosnia, Johnson chuckles as she positions herself for a good shot. The POV travels around a bit, until the camera is placed on the ground, in what looks like the right spot. Wait, there’s just one more thing to fix, as a hand appears from out of frame to pluck some pieces of grass. Perfect. It’s likely the resulting image was incorporated for just a flash during a transition or   moment. In a work about the horrors of war, it surely flew by barely noticed. But for an instant, the cameraperson was   capturing a great image. Later, Cameraperson is surveying a great field in Texas when lightning strikes. Again, who knows how the image was used in whichever film. In this version, though, we’re privy to Johnson’s surprised gasp. It’s a reminder that everything we see is  . As she travels the globe, we begin to better understand the personality taking these shots. Much of the time, Johnson takes a     approach, but she is also there to guide interviewees, from courtroom attorneys to terrified young women at a health clinic.  The instinct to intervene has to be kept in check. While shooting a young boy playing with a hatchet on a farm, we hear Johnson clicking her tongue, and can almost sense how close she is to shouting, “No, no!” She is, after all, a mother of twins, whom we see during glimpses of her home life in New York  —   in stark contrast to her prowling an   prison in Yemen. The jumbled nature of Cameraperson is sure to have detractors. It has no discernible plot and it’s hard to defend against accusations that we’re just looking at all the junk that didn’t make it into other movies. (Is this cinema’s first attempt at the record industry’s old   and rarities gambit?) But patterns do emerge. Struggles in the world’s hotspots mirror situations in the west, and Johnson connects them thematically and visually. (There is a   of long legs crossing thresholds.) To make the movie work, the audience needs to put in a little effort, but a philosophy of connectedness is present. For those happy to ride shotgun during a remarkable travelogue, it’s no surprise that Cameraperson is extremely well shot. ",-0.5
"Brazil top judges back graft probe despite concern over Lula’s detention.  Senior judges in Brazil voiced concern on Saturday over the detention of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, even as they threw their support behind the sweeping corruption investigation that threatens to topple his embattled successor. Lula’s three hours of questioning in police custody on Friday was the highest profile development in the    probe focused on state oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras). The detention of the    Lula, Brazil’s first   president and a hero to millions of his fellow citizens, shocked his supporters. His   government helped lift an estimated 40 million Brazilians out of poverty.  Supporters and opponents of the former union leader clashed outside his home on the outskirts of Sao Paulo after Lula was detained by police early on Friday.  Supreme Court Justice Marco Aurélio Mello told CBN Radio on Saturday that ”nothing justified the use of force” when police picked up Lula unannounced from his apartment. Even Justice Gilmar Mendes, who has publicly said there is strong evidence the ruling Workers’ Party used graft proceeds to fund electoral campaigns, called Lula’s interrogation in police custody a ”delicate” situation in O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. The federal judge who ordered Lula to be brought in for questioning, Sergio Moro, said in a statement on Saturday that steps were taken to protect Lula’s image during the operation, and he expressed regret that it sparked violence.  Speaking to his supporters at Workers’ Party headquarters in Sao Paulo after being released on Friday, Lula said investigators were ”disrespectful of democracy” and that he ”deserved respect.” Lula has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing either while in office or since. President Dilma Rousseff flew from Brasilia on Saturday morning to meet with Lula in his apartment in Sao Bernardo do Campo, in a show of support for her predecessor and political mentor. She called his detention ”unnecessary.” But the public prosecutors in charge of conducting the probe shot back at critics’ claims that Lula was handled poorly. They said police have detained 116 other suspects in the Operation Car Wash investigation in the past two years who were treated with similar care as was taken with the   and never has the public complained of the practice. Lula ”is owned no more respect than any other Brazilian citizen, as he holds no power that puts him beyond the reach of the Car Wash investigation” according to the law, prosecutors said.     Before Friday, some analysts had questioned whether the crackdown on graft could be at risk of fizzling out after the justice minister stepped down amid a barrage of criticism from the ruling Workers Party over the investigation. But Supreme Court justices were unambiguous in support for prosecutors pursuing their investigations into Brazil’s biggest ever corruption scandal.  Justice Rosa Weber late on Friday rejected a request by Lula’s lawyers to suspend investigations into real estate assets and the  ’s institute, which police allege he and his family likely used to launder money stolen from Petrobras. Even Mello, who was critical of Lula’s arrest, said the evidence uncovered by prosecutors was ”very serious” and deserved further investigation. The pressure on Rousseff and Lula shows no sign of abating. Local media have reported on a spate of new plea bargains by senior politicians that could further ensnare the government. IstoE news magazine on Thursday published alleged testimony by Workers’ Party Senator Delcidio Amaral claiming that Rousseff and Lula both directly benefited from corruption. He alleged Rousseff had tried to hamper the investigation. The president strongly denied the reported accusations on Friday. Epoca weekly magazine, meanwhile, on Saturday published testimony from   Pedro Correa, who also outlined graft at Petrobras stretching back to Lula’s government.  Ratcheting up political tensions, opposition lawmakers said on Friday they will block Congressional voting until the Supreme Court clears the way for the impeachment process against Rousseff. Congress is due to hear the proceedings against the president, on grounds that she broke budgetary guidelines to boost her 2014   campaign, but is awaiting guidelines on how to proceed from the court first.

"Scott Uehlinger: Susan Rice Unmasking ‘Abuse of Power’ Violates ‘Spirit of the Law,’ Should Be ‘Further Investigated’. Former CIA operations officer Scott Uehlinger,   of The Station Chief podcast, talked about the Susan Rice “unmasking” story with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“I think it’s an issue which deeply concerns people like myself and other people,   officers in the intel community,” Uehlinger said. “Even though at this point, there seems to be no evidence of breaking the law, this ‘unmasking’ of people was   at best. I think it really shows that abuse of power and the fact that many people in the Obama administration were willing to violate the spirit of the laws designed to protect Americans, perhaps rather than the law itself. ”  LISTEN: “As a   CIA officer, we were always told by upper authority, you’re always told to  —   and the quote is  —   ‘avoid the appearance of impropriety,’” he said. “Well, this does not pass that smell test, definitely. ” Uehlinger said another thing that concerns   officers in the intelligence and military communities is “the American people, average Americans like myself, are tired of seeing two sets of rules followed by the   and then the   people. ” “This is just part of that again. A   officer would have gotten into big trouble doing anything remotely like this,” he observed. “But now, we have a lot of people saying that she should just be given a pass. ” “While I understand, you know, it’s important that the Trump administration has to move forward with its domestic agenda, but these allegations demand to be further investigated,” he urged. Kassam proposed that Democrats and their media would not allow the Trump administration to move forward with any part of its agenda until this “Russia hysteria” is cleaned up. That will be a difficult task since, as Kassam noted, the hysteria has been burning at fever pitch for months without a shred of evidence to back up the wildest allegations. Uehlinger agreed and addressed Kassam’s point that media coverage alternates between “no surveillance was conducted” and “we know everything about Trump’s Russia connections. ” “The Obama administration relaxed the rule that allowed raw intelligence that was gathered by the NSA to be shared throughout the government,” he pointed out. “First of all, to relax that, there is absolutely no operational justification for doing that. With all of the   problems, with espionage, with Snowden, all these things we’ve had, to raise by an order of magnitude the access to this very sensitive information makes no operational sense at all. ”  “So for someone to approve that, it’s clear they had another intent, and I believe the intent was to allow for further leakage,” he charged. “To give more people access, thus more leaks, which, in fact, would hurt the Trump administration. It seems very obvious when you put that together and combine it with the actions of Susan Rice and other people in unmasking people. That is the true purpose behind this. ”  “I say this as somebody who  —   you have to remember, when I was a station chief overseas, this is what I was reporting on. I was in countries like Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kosovo  —   countries which constantly had the offices of the prime minister or president using the intelligence services to suppress the domestic opposition. So I’ve been to this rodeo before, many a time. I saw the storm clouds gathering several weeks ago, and everything I’ve suspected has so far come to fruition,” Uehlinger said. He pronounced it “very disappointing” that such transparent abuse of government power for partisan politics would occur in the United States. “An intelligence service has to have the trust of the people and the government in order to function effectively,” he said. “With all of these scandals happening, and with the name of perhaps the CIA and other intelligence community elements in the mud, this makes the object of protecting our national security more problematic. The agencies have to have the trust of the American people, and they’re losing it, because it seems as though they’ve been weaponized  —    perhaps, like I said, not breaking the law but playing very close to the line. ” Kassam suggested that leaking the information might have been illegal, even if Rice was legally entitled to request information on Donald Trump’s campaign and unmask the U. S. persons monitored during surveillance of foreign intelligence targets. “That’s absolutely the case,” Uehlinger agreed. He went on to argue that the absence of hard evidence for any wrongdoing by the Trump campaign in all of these leaks was highly significant. “Since basically the Obama administration has sort of loaded this with these rule changes and all to allow for leaks the fact that there is no ‘smoking gun’ of Trump administration collusion with Russia indicates that there isn’t any. There is nothing substantial here because a juicy morsel like that would certainly have been leaked by the same people that have been leaking everything else. The fact it hasn’t been leaked out means it does not exist,” he reasoned. Kassam said some of the Russia hysteria came from imputing sinister motives to conventional business dealings, arguing that Trump’s organization made deals around the world, and it is exceedingly difficult to do business with any Russian entity that is not somehow connected to the Russian government. “That’s an excellent point. You’re absolutely right,” Uehlinger responded. “It shows these people who are doing these gambits are relying on the relative ignorance of the American public of the actual nuts and bolts of intelligence to make their point. Anyone with any background in this stuff can see it for what it is: a desperate attempt to discredit an administration because they were crushed in the past elections. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

"New Evidence Shows There’s Still Bias Against Black Natural Hair. Stories about black women whose employers asked them to cut their dreadlocks or to trim their big afros have surfaced with more frequency in the last few years. Now a new study confirms that many people  —   including black ones  —   have a bias against the types and styles of natural hair worn by black people. The ”Good Hair Study” was conducted by Perception Institute, which describes itself as ”a consortium of researchers, advocates and strategists” that uses emotional and psychological research to identify and reduce bias in areas such as law enforcement, education, civil justice and the workplace. The study resulted from a partnership with Shea Moisture, a   hair and body products company, and aimed to better understand the connection between implicit bias and textured hair. The Good Hair Study asked over 4, 000 participants to take an online IAT, or implicit association test, which involves   photos of black women with smooth and natural hair, and rotating word associations with both. According to the study, ”a majority of people, regardless of race and gender, hold some bias towards women of color based on their hair.” But the results also indicate that this bias is learned behavior, and can be unlearned. In the study, millennials of all races came across as more accepting of textured hair. And ”naturalistas,” women who choose to wear their hair natural, ”showed either no bias or a slight preference for textured hair.” Some key findings confirm that black women suffer more anxiety around hair issues, and spend more on hair care than their white peers. They are almost twice as likely to experience social pressure at work to straighten their hair compared to white women. The study also concludes that, ”White women demonstrate the strongest bias  —   both explicit and implicit  —   against textured hair.” They rated it as ”less beautiful,” ”less  ” and ”less professional than smooth hair.” However, white women who are in contact with black women naturalistas demonstrated lower levels of bias. Given that white women make up a large majority of the 38 percent of female managers who decide what looks are appropriate for work, legal conflicts sometimes ensue. And courts tend to rule in favor of employers in such cases. Noliwe Rooks, a Cornell University professor who writes about the intersection of beauty and race, says for some reason, natural black hair just frightens some white people. ”I have yet to come across an actual court case . .. where the texture of hair for another racial group has reached the point of a court case,” she said. The good news is that natural hair has become increasingly popular, as black women decide to give their hair a break from chemicals and heat. The Boston Globe reported that ”sales of hair relaxer dropped from $206 million in 2008 to $152 million in 2013.” At the same time, demand for products for natural hair began to increase. Tellingly, beauty companies outside the black beauty and hair industries began to notice. Carol’s Daughter was bought by L’Oréal in 2014. Today, numerous      companies have lines for naturally curly hair. There are even online curl pattern charts that ”grade” curls’ looseness or tightness to guide the towards products that will work best for her. It seems the naturalistas are making inroads. Certainly, popular culture is infused with images of women with natural, unstraightened hair: Tracee Ellis Ross, Yara Shahidi and Marsai Martin have all gotten praise for frequently going au naturelle on their hit show  . Esperanza Spaulding reigns over her bass with a towering Afro. NBC viewers reeled when Tamron Hall traded her slick pixie for a little curly fro in 2014. So for younger people, natural hair is just that  —   a natural, obvious thing to wear. Even the U. S. Army got on board after an initial stumble. If trends signal what’s ahead, workplaces may eventually become safe havens for natural hair, which has endured as a touchstone in racial politics for far too long.",-0.5
"FDA plan would make cigarettes less addictive. The Food and Drug Administration is moving ahead with new rules that would reduce the nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. It’s also exploring whether more regulation of flavored tobacco, including menthol, would help reduce overall smoking rates in the U.S. Why it matters: Smoking kills almost 500,000 Americans each year. Making cigarettes less addictive or non-addictive could ultimately save as many as 8 million lives and billions of dollars in health care costs, the FDA said today.",0.0
"Fitch cuts Italy’s debt rating; cites weak growth, political risk.  Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italy’s sovereign debt on Friday, citing the country’s sluggish economic growth, fiscal slippage, weak government, banking problems and political risk ahead of elections due in 2018. Fitch cut Italy’s sovereign credit rating to ’BBB’ from ’BBB+’ a move that could put further pressure on its borrowing costs which have already been rising in recent months. The outlook for the rating is now stable, it said. The agency had put the euro zone’s third largest economy on watch in October with a negative outlook ahead of a referendum on constitutional reforms intended to streamline lawmaking which was lost by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Renzi then resigned to make way for what Fitch described as ”a weakened interim government,” led by his former foreign minister Paolo Gentiloni. ”Italy’s persistent track record of fiscal slippage, backloading of consolidation, weak economic growth and resulting failure to bring down the very high level of general government debt has left it more exposed to potential adverse shocks,” Fitch said. ”This is compounded by an increase in political risk and ongoing weakness in the banking sector, which has required planned public intervention in three banks since December,” it added. Italy’s public debt hit a record last year at almost 133 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)   the highest ratio in the   euro zone after Greece. Italy, which has the most sluggish growth in the euro zone and an unstable political outlook, has repeatedly backslid on promised deficit cuts. The result is that markets have become increasingly leery of its government bonds. The spread between Italian benchmark bond yields and their safer German equivalent has widened to more than two percentage points from one percentage point a year ago, and that rise would have been far steeper without the support of the European Central Bank. Fitch noted that Italy’s debt last year totaled 11. 2 percent of GDP higher than the target Rome had set in 2013. BANK WOES The ratings agency forecast Italy’s economy will grow by 0. 9 percent in 2017, the same pace as last year, and by 1. 0 percent in 2018, which would still leave   GDP more than 5 percent below the 2007 level. In January, Canadian ratings agency DBRS cut Italy’s sovereign rating, citing the same problems highlighted by Fitch. Moody’s Investors Service also has the country on a negative outlook, meaning a downgrade could be in the pipeline. Fitch said its outlook for Italy’s banking sector was negative, reflecting the high level of   loans and weak profitability. Three banks   Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca   are seeking public intervention to keep them in business. The Italian banking sector as a whole is weighed down by some 203 billion euros ($217. 68 billion) of bad loans. The agency said that ahead of next year’s election, the ”risks of weak or unstable government have increased, as has the possibility of populist and eurosceptic parties influencing policy.” Recent opinion polls have given a clear and growing lead to the     Movement, which wants to hold a referendum on Italy’s continued membership of the euro zone.  (Editing by G Crosse) BERLIN U. S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist approach to trade has the potential to ignite a trade war, the German DIHK Chambers of Commerce warned on Tuesday, adding that German companies were among the biggest job creators in America.

"Paper: Alex Soros Enlists Pros to Practice Photo Poses, Procure Women - Breitbart. The New York Post’s Dana Schuster profiles the public rise of Alex Soros, son of billionaire globalist activist George Soros, and the cultivation of his playboy image. [From the New York Post:  It’s an August weekend at “Camp Soros,” a $72 million Water Mill estate, and the rosé is flowing.

"Psychedelic drugs induce ’heightened state of consciousness’, brain scans show. Brain scans have revealed the first evidence for what appears to be a heightened state of consciousness in people who took psychedelic drugs in the name of science. Healthy volunteers who received LSD, ketamine or psilocybin, a compound found in magic mushrooms, were found to have more random brain activity than normal while under the influence, according to a study into the effects of the drugs. The shift in brain activity accompanied a host of peculiar sensations that the participants said ranged from floating and finding inner peace, to distortions in time and a conviction that the self was disintegrating. Researchers at the University of Sussex and Imperial College, London, measured the activity of neurons in people’s brains as the drugs took hold. Similar measurements have shown that when people are asleep or under anaesthetic, their neurons tend to fire in a more predictable way than when they are awake. “What we find is that under each of these psychedelic compounds, this specific measure of global conscious level goes up, so it moves in the other direction. The neural activity becomes more unpredictable,” said Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex. “Until now, we’ve only ever seen decreases compared to the baseline of the normal waking state. ” The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, appears 74 years to the day after the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman went on the world’s first LSD trip. In one of the most terrifying examples of self experimentation in the annals of science, Hoffman ingested 250 micrograms of lysergic acid and had to be helped home on his bicycle by his lab assistant. After a local doctor reassured Hoffman that he was not about to die, the scientist began to enjoy himself, writing later about fantastic images surging in on him and “exploding in coloured fountains. ” The scans found the most notable effects in parts of the brain that are known to be important for perceptions, rather than other roles such as language and movement. And while it is unclear how the change in brain activity affects consciousness, the result is what the scientists expected. “I think people would have the intuitive idea that their experience on psychedelic compounds is a bit more random, a bit less constrained, that there’s a mixing of the senses, and all kinds of connections that are experienced between things that are previously unconnected,” Seth said. Robin   a researcher at Imperial College who took part in the study, said the sudden increase in randomness in brain activity appeared to reflect a deeper and richer conscious state. “People tend to associate phrases like ‘a higher state of consciousness’ with hippy speak and mystical nonsense. This is potentially the beginning of the demystification, showing its physiological and biological underpinnings,” he said. “Maybe this is a neural signature of the mind opening. ” Beyond confirming what scores of hippies learned more than 40 years ago, the research could help scientists to understand what neural activity corresponds to different levels of consciousness in humans. Another hope is that by understanding how people respond to the drugs, doctors can more accurately predict which patients might benefit from having psychedelic drugs to treat mental disorders, such as depression.   was among researchers who published a small trial last year into the use of psilocybin to treat serious depression. The results were promising, but more studies are needed before the compound can be considered for treatment, and the scientists warned people off picking magic mushrooms to treat their condition.  “The evidence is becoming clear that there is a clinical efficacy with these drugs,” said Seth. “We might be able to measure the effects of LSD in an individual way to predict how someone might respond to it as treatment. ” ",-0.5
"The great disorientation machine. The coming release of a secret House memo, hotly sought by conservatives, will intensify the great muddying of the Russia investigation in the public's mind. Why the memo matters: Trump's allies are betting that when all is said and done — and when special counsel Bob Mueller has completed his report — the American people will be so thoroughly disgusted with everyone that the political outcome is a wash. I have been flooded with email from conservatives who have been ignited by the #ReleaseTheMemo campaign that has flourished online, fed by Fox News. The Trump Justice Department warned that the classified memo's release, without proper review, would be ""extraordinarily reckless."" That smoldering fire ignited yesterday after the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release the memo, with the final decision up to President Trump. ""Committee Republicans said the memo’s release would shed useful light on potential political bias that may have warped the early stages of the Russia investigation,"" per the N.Y. Times. ""Democrats called the three-and-a-half-page document a dangerous effort to build a narrative to undercut the department’s continuing Russia investigation, using cherry-picked facts assembled with little or no context."" This followed the revelation earlier in the day that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe would step down in advance of his scheduled retirement, after months of private and public pressure from the Trump administration. What Trump can point to in the ""failing"" N.Y. Times: ""Agents and lawyers expect the report by the Justice Department’s inspector general ... to be highly critical of some F.B.I. actions in 2016, when the bureau was investigating both Hillary Clinton’s email use and the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia."" Jonathan Swan and I are told that President Trump has already made up his mind to release the memo, which he sees as vindication, despite Justice Department resistance. Trump believes it will solidify in the public's mind that there's a Deep State out to get him. Couple that fact with some genuinely troubling text messages between FBI agents, and the Fox News chorus warning of a Deep State coup, and you have the makings of a disorientation machine. Last night, I saw how hot the House was burning when I interviewed Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, just after Sean Hannity had told his prime-time Fox audience that the memo would expose ""the biggest political scandal in American history."" Hannity said he has been told the memo's contents ""will shock the conscience,"" and that the bias in the early stages of the Russia investigation ""makes Watergate like stealing a Snickers bar from a drugstore."" Hannity added: ""We're talking about potential crimes. We're talking about people being charged, going to jail. ... It's a scary night."" Schiff told me his office has received obscene calls and death threats over the what he calls a ""Republican spin memo,"" and said the right's ""reckless hyperbole is just so destructive of our democracy."" Schiff said the right faces the danger of a letdown when the memo ""doesn't live up to its billing."" Schiff added: ""They have so hyped this ... that they've led their echo chamber into thinking that this is something extraordinary. ... It's incredibly misleading. I don't think it in any way impugns the Russia investigation, or provides any basis for firing any of the personnel involved."" Be smart: This strategy is working better than you think. Trump portrayed Hillary Clinton as an enemy of the state, and she lost. He turned the media into an enemy of the state, if you look at polls of Republicans. And, perhaps most alarming of all, he's trying to make the FBI look like an enemy of the state.  *Note: the first bullet has been updated to say DOJ said the memo should not be released without being reviewed.",0.0
"U.S. federal court jury finds Apple infringed three Qualcomm patents – TechCrunch. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm has chalked up another small legal victory against Apple in another patent litigation suit. A jury in a U.S. federal court in San Diego found Friday that Apple owes Qualcomm about $31M for infringing three patents, per Reuters. As we reported earlier the San Diego patent suit relates to the power consumption and speed of boot-up times for iPhones sold between mid-2017 and late-2018. Qualcomm had asked to be awarded up to $1.41 in unpaid patent royalties damages per infringing iPhone sold during the period. The chipmaker has filed a number of patent suits against the iPhone maker in the U.S., Europe and Asia in recent years. The suits are skirmishes in a bigger battle between the pair over licensing terms that Apple alleges are unfair and illegal. In a statement on on the San Diego trial outcome Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, Don Rosenberg, said: Today’s unanimous jury verdict is the latest victory in our worldwide patent litigation directed at holding Apple accountable for using our valuable technologies without paying for them. The technologies invented by Qualcomm and others are what made it possible for Apple to enter the market and become so successful so quickly. The three patents found to be infringed in this case represent just a small fraction of Qualcomm’s valuable portfolio of tens of thousands of patents. We are gratified that courts all over the world are rejecting Apple’s strategy of refusing to pay for the use of our IP. The iPhone models involved in the patent suit are iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X, which were found to infringe two Qualcomm patents, U.S. Patent No. 8,838,949 (“flashless booting”), and U.S. Patent No. 9,535,490 (data management between the applications processor and the modem); and the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X which were found to infringe Qualcomm’s U.S. Patent No. 8,633,936 (high performance rich visual graphics with power management). The patents are not contained in modems and are not standards-essential to cellular devices, Qualcomm said. Reuters suggests the jury’s damages award could have wider significance if it ends up being factored into the looming billion dollar royalties suit between Apple and Qualcomm — by putting a dollar value on some of the latter’s IP, the San Diego trial potentially bolsters its contention that its chip licensing practices are fair, it said. At the time of writing it’s not clear whether Apple intends to appeal the outcome of the trial. Reuters reports the iPhone maker declined to comment on that point, after expressing general disappointment with the outcome. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment. In a statement provided to the news agency Apple said: “Qualcomm’s ongoing campaign of patent infringement claims is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the larger issues they face with investigations into their business practices in U.S. federal court, and around the world.” Cupertino filed its billion dollar royalties suit against Qualcomm two years ago. It has reason to be bullish going into the trial, given a preliminary ruling Thursday — in which a U.S. federal court judge found Qualcomm owes Apple nearly $1BN in patent royalty rebate payments (via CNBC). The trial itself kicks off next month. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed antitrust charges against Qualcomm in 2017 — accusing the chipmaker of operating a monopoly and forcing exclusivity from Apple while charging “excessive” licensing fees for standards-essential patents. That trial wrapped up in January and is pending a verdict from Judge Lucy Koh. At the same time, Qualcomm has also been pursuing several international patent suits against Apple — also with some success. In December Apple filed an appeal in China to overturn a preliminary ruling that could have blocked iPhone sales in the market. While in Germany it did pull older iPhone models from sale in its own stores in January. But by February it was selling the two models again — albeit with Qualcomm chips, rather than Intel, inside.

"Why Apple Is Fighting Not To Unlock iPhones For The Government – TechCrunch. Yesterday, the FBI filed an order Shortly thereafter, Apple CEO Tim Cook published a bold statement indicating that Apple planned to fight the order. Apple was joined by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which said it would aid  in the fight. We’ve already covered the nuts and bolts of the request, as well as Cook’s response and the White House’s response to that response. You can read those for a primer. There has been a lot of ink spilled and there will likely be a lot more, but there are a few questions that I think deserve a closer look — and there is a broader point to be made that will likely get obfuscated by people pursuing technical details rather than implications. This current order is all about Apple refusing to unlock a single device for the FBI. It is not to be confused with the related, but bigger, battle over the government forcing tech companies to weaken their encryption by introducing a ‘secret’ key that only they have. The key question of the day is this: Why is Apple fighting not to unlock a terrorist’s iPhone, instead of waiting to fight their big battle over encryption back doors? Let’s dissect it. The government wants Apple to create a ‘one-off’ version of iOS that it could install on this device with three key changes: The final condition there is the scariest, and the one that Apple objects to the most. Don’t get me wrong. Cook’s letter clearly states that Apple is opposed to all of the conditions, but that last one is different. It is asking Apple to add a vulnerability to its software and devices, not just ‘remove’ a roadblock. There is a possibility that Apple could drag this out with the FBI for a very long time, arguing about reasonable demands or the costs of this to Apple (which could be prohibitive as signing firmware is an incredibly non-trivial process). One outcome could be that Apple grinds down the asks until they just disable the auto-erase function, which is an operating system option that already exists, and leave the rest of it to the FBI to figure out. But that final ask is what the entire objection hinges on. The All Writs Act, passed in 1789 (yes, a 200-year-old law,) is being used to force Apple to comply. The fact that the act is being used to try to make Apple do a lot of work to modify iOS and to add functionality that would significantly weaken its products and their security will likely be at the core of Apple’s defense when this gets to the courts. It’s a huge ballooning of the scope of the AWA, and it sets a precedent for allowing the government to force Apple or other companies to modify their systems to allow access to your private data. And herein lies the rub. There has been some chatter about whether these kinds of changes would even be possible with Apple’s newer devices. Those devices come equipped with Apple’s proprietary Secure Enclave, a portion of the core processing chip where private encryption keys are stored and used to secure data and to enable features like Touch ID. Apple says that the things that the FBI is asking for are also possible on newer devices with the Secure Enclave. The technical solutions to the asks would be different (no specifics were provided) than they are on the iPhone 5c (and other older iPhones), but not impossible. If I had to bet, Apple is probably working double time to lock it down even tighter. Its reply to the next order of this type is likely to be two words long. You pick the two. The point is that the FBI is asking Apple to crack its own safe. It doesn’t matter how good the locks are if you modify them to be weak after installing them. And once the precedent is set then the opportunity is there for similar requests to be made of all billion or so active iOS devices. Hence the importance of this fight for Apple. This is why the debate around this particular order should not focus overmuch on the technical aspects — but on the fact that the government would be weakening the security of a private company’s product, potentially impacting the civil liberties of American citizens and foreign nationals worldwide that use those products. Apple has complied with government information requests for years, and likely did so in this case. It is technically possible, for instance, to retrieve data from iCloud backups of devices. Farook’s device was last backed up in October 19th of 2015, which means that the FBI already has access to that data. The agency can use other avenues (and likely has) to gather data about calls by issuing information requests to cell carriers, for instance. “From my crude testing in the past on an iPhone 5, a four digit passcode should be possible to brute force in less than an hour. A six digit passcode should be possible to brute force in less than a day,” says Will Strafach, ex-jailbreaker and CEO of mobile security firm Sudo Security Group. “I have not tested times for passcodes with numbers, letters or symbols, but it is fairly easy to understand why it would take substantially longer. With numeric passcodes, it’s 10,000 possibilities if four digit and 1,000,000 possibilities if six digit. But introducing symbols and letters drastically will increase the possibilities, considering you could even use multiple keyboards (for example: an English phrase, an Arabic phrase, and then. some numbers and symbols).” There are also already tools that the law uses to access passcode-locked iPhones. Many of these tools are bundles of programs that use jailbreak exploits to gain access to the iPhone’s memory, and then a suite of tools to access and analyze the data. These tools are then branded with a security firm’s rubber stamp and sold to law enforcement. When the exploits are repaired by iOS updates or patches, the tools become ineffective. https://twitter.com/JZdziarski/status/700085957643657220 The idea that a government-issued phone that the FBI says Farook used to talk to co-workers would be used to openly facilitate an act of terrorism is somewhat far-fetched. Instead, it is being used as a crowbar that essentially forces Apple to oppose the order. Regardless of the outcome, it’s likely that this case will be used to bolster the call for Congressional legislation that forces American companies to weaken their encryption by installing a ‘back door’ for the government. Which brings us back to a question of philosophy. There are other battles to come in this fight. Encryption of data on iPhones, for instance, is another whole technical gambit, one that Apple has made great efforts to remove from the equation by making it impossible for them to decrypt customer data even if requests were made. That would require that Apple modify its software and firmware on its devices to enable governmental agencies to bypass encryption. Once that method exists, there is absolutely, positively, no way for it to be kept solely for the use of the government. It also raises the question of how any international user of an iPhone would ever feel safe — especially given what we now know about the government’s electronic surveillance capabilities and its willingness to use them. Apple is choosing to fight this battle now, rather than later. Cook’s letter draws a line out on the beach, where we’re still talking about allowing brute force cracking of iPhone passwords — rather than right up against the fortress, where we will be fighting for our right to secure encryption. It’s a gambit with risks, for sure, outlined well by Ben Thompson here. If Apple loses this battle because the court sees a request for a terrorist’s iPhone to be unlocked to be reasonable, then it is going to be that much harder to fight the encryption battle later. But Apple sees this as the line — the modification of one of its products to weaken its security. To Apple, any back door is still a back door, and an unacceptable condition. It doesn’t matter to Apple whether the fight is over a passcode or over encryption. Like I said, it’s a risk, but it’s one that Apple feels it must take. All of the various outcomes of this situation make alterations to the playing field. The government gets Apple to add a weakness to a product? A precedent for weakening all security. Apple fighting back successfully? A possible precedent for protecting the users of all smartphones iOS, Android and otherwise. A potential win in the courts? Precedent to protect security, but also possibly to force Congress to ruin American encryption. 1/5 Important post by @tim_cook. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users’ privacy — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 17, 2016 Other tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have yet to weigh in — though they have potentially just as much to lose or gain. Whether this is because they have facilitated these requests without a fight, who knows? For Apple’s part, this isn’t the first time that Cook has taken a strong stance on security and privacy, his speech last year summed up how Apple has used it as a differentiation point before and since. This is a seminal battle between the biggest tech company on the planet and the most powerful government on the planet. This is why it’s important that we don’t get mired down in technicalities. For Apple, and for us, this is not a question of can we, but a question of should we. A question that will have implications for everyone from journalists to heads of state to private citizens of all countries. Article updated to correctly identify the phone’s owner, Syed Farook.",0.0
"France readies for Euro 2016 with intense security measures. On Friday night, host nation France will face off against Romania in the opening match of Euro 2016, one of soccer's most prestigious international tournaments. The championship will be held across stadiums in France and will showcase some of the world's best footballers. It will take place amid heightened security concerns after a series of high-profile, fatal terror attacks in France and neighboring Belgium. Friday's match will be held at the Stade de France in Paris, where suicide bombers struck in November, killing four people, including themselves. That incident was part of a series of co-ordinated assaults on the city that killed 130 people and came after an earlier attack on Paris in January that left 17 dead. This week, the U.K. government warned there was ""a high threat from terrorism"" at Euro 2016 – hot on the heels of a similar alert from the U.S. State Department. French authorities appear to be leaving little to chance and the country is set to remain in a state of emergency until July 26, after the tournament is over. ""The authorities will consider previous attacks, so they will be preparing for a small arms attacks similar to what we saw in Paris (on) November 13 last year and the January attacks at (the office of) Charlie Hebo,"" David Lowe, an expert in terrorism from the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University, told CNBC. ""(These types of attacks) are relatively easy to plan and carry out and they give the maximum effect in both casualties and in the terror effect,"" he said, adding that suicide bombings were another possibility. The French government expects 2.5 million spectators – many from abroad – will attend Euro 2016 games across France this summer. These fans should expect queues at stadiums and other venues, Malcolm Tarbitt, executive director of safety and security at the International Centre for Sport Security, told CNBC. ""With French authorities extending the state of emergency to cover Euro 2016, fans will obviously have to expect a higher level of security than they're used to at stadiums and other venues,"" Tarbitt said. ""As a result, a bit of patience, good humor and common sense will be required."" Around 90,000 people are set to provide security during the tournament, including 42,000 police officers and 10,000 soldiers. Each competing soccer team will be assigned at least two of France's elite RAID officers. France will deploy police and gendarmerie around the perimeters of stadiums, in advance, while local authorities will be responsible for security in and around fan zones. The U.K. government has told Britons attending games to be ""vigilant at all times,"" warning that stadiums and transport hubs could be targeted by terrorists. On the same note, Tarbitt told CNBC that vigilance from the public was one of the several factors that could help keep the tournament safe, along with effective communication and intelligence gathering. ""When it comes to securing any major international sport event, intelligence and coordinating information quickly and appropriately through the various levels of public and private stakeholders involved in securing the event will be vital,"" he told CNBC. ""Whether this is sensitive intelligence about possible terrorist suspects from different countries or even information about security operations at a particular venue, effective communications between all parties involved with security and the general public will be an important area for the overall success and security of the tournament."" Lowe and Tarbitt said France had likely made detailed plans of possible responses to attacks. ""Unfortunately, French authorities have got very recent experience of dealing with terrorist attacks and from the previous attacks they suffered, one important task that will have been carried out is the debrief, from which to learn what went well and what did not go so well and learn from it,"" Lowe said. Tarbitt said preparedness exercises had been carried out in the run-up to the tournament. ""For any potential major incident at stadium or fan venue, evacuating spectators and ensuring a rapid response from police and ambulance services will be prioritized. Neutralizing any threat and treatment of any possible casualties will follow shortly after,"" he told CNBC. Lowe added that the likelihood of an attack occurring was still remote. ""One also has to look at the number of attacks that have occurred (in relation) to those that have been prevented in Europe,"" he said. ""France is on such a high security alert and has kept its state of emergency, many of the locations linked to the tournament will be hard for terrorists to penetrate,"" he added.",0.0
"Amazon to add more than 100,000 jobs in U.S. hiring spree.  Amazon. com Inc on Thursday said it will create more than 100, 000 jobs in the United States, from software development to warehouse work, in its latest move to win over shoppers by investing in faster delivery. The world’s largest online retailer will grow its   U. S. workforce by more than 50 percent to over 280, 000 in the next 18 months, it said in a press release. Amazon is spending heavily on new warehouses so it can stock goods closer to customers and fulfill orders quickly and cheaply. The new hires, from Florida to Texas and California, will be key to the company’s promise of   shipping to members of its Amazon Prime shopping club, which has given it an edge over rivals. At least 16 new U. S. fulfillment centers are in the works for this year and next, said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Some mark Amazon’s first expansion into population centers like Houston, he said. Amazon declined to comment on where it would hire the most, whether for fulfillment work or corporate roles. ”We view this as a positive signal . .. of the current trajectory of Amazon’s businesses, as well as management’s confidence,” Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. ”While there may be some ’political capital’ involved with the timing and details of Amazon’s announcement,” he added, ”we suspect there is little, if any, shift of employment at Amazon from international locations to the U. S.”   Donald Trump has made job creation in the United States a cornerstone of his agenda. Last week, Ford Motor Co reversed plans for a $1. 6 billion factory in Mexico and said it would add 700 jobs in Michigan after receiving criticism from Trump. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team gave the   partial credit for Amazon’s hiring spree. ”The   met with heads of several of the tech companies and urged them to keep their jobs and production inside the United States,” spokesman Sean Spicer said in his opening remarks in a press call on Thursday.  Reported to have a grueling work culture, Amazon has come under fire for operating   warehouses and not recording workers’ injuries.  The company also is bleeding    retailers of more jobs than it has created, according to the Institute for Local  . ”Amazon is an even   employer than other warehouse operators,” said the institute’s   Stacy Mitchell. Amazon said it has a focus on safety, conducting millions of checks each year and requiring safety training for workers. It said employee pay is highly competitive and benefits are the same for warehouse workers and executives. It did not immediately comment on its impact on    jobs.

"Art You Can Wear On Your Arm? For Judith Leiber, It’s In The Bag. Judith Leiber’s handbags are meant for wowing  —   not schlepping. They’re shaped like penguins, fruits, zebras, streetcars and firecrackers. First ladies and movie stars have carried them, and now they’re the subject of an exhibition at the Museum of Art and Design in Manhattan. ”I wanted to make something that was more interesting and more special than what other people made,” explains Leiber, now 96. But that also meant they weren’t cheap. ”I wanted to make the most expensive bags that anybody could make,” she adds. ”That’s what I like to do.” Leiber initially planned to make her fortune in cosmetics. Her family sent her to college in London to study chemistry, but World War II broke out and she returned to her native Hungary. Completing her education was no longer an option and the Jewish teenager became apprenticed to a handbag company  —   rising to master craftswoman. But as the war escalated, the business closed.   Her family was moved from their home, her father sent to a camp, and Judith, her sister and mother were forced to live in the ghetto. They all survived the Holocaust and Judith met Gus Leiber, an American soldier, and moved with him to New York in 1946. There, she worked in the American handbag industry and, at her artist husband’s insistence, founded her own company in 1963.  ”Every night she would cut patterns,” Gus Leiber says. ”She was simply a genius with a knife. She worked night and day  —   it was remarkable.” Gus Leiber taught art by day and, in his spare time, made deliveries and did whatever else his wife’s fledgling company needed. After an iffy line of green handbags that weren’t so popular, the company grew rapidly, from four employees to 200. All told, in her   career, Leiber designed 3, 500 bags. There are about half that many in the museum next to her house. Collections manager Ann Stewart says Leiber’s ideas could come from anywhere  —   paintings she’d seen, a piece of pottery, photographs, nature, even grocery produce. Leiber’s food series  —   sparkly fruits and veggies  —   is ”really fun,” Stewart says. The blood red tomato looks tempting enough to eat. The eggplant is a perfect specimen. And the bunch of asparagus? That was a favorite for sculptor Larry Kallenberg. It was his job to make many of the   wax molds used to cast Leiber’s bags. ”This asparagus has always been the favorite thing I ever made for her,” Kallenberg says. ”Lions, peacocks, ah, every day, but an asparagus pocketbook? How crazy is that? And how wonderful that she would think of it.” Leiber called him her buddy boy. ”I was her hands,” he said. ”They were all her ideas what I did was to modify somewhat, every once in a while I’d come up with a design. But basically everything was run by her. . .. I just did what she told me to do  —   magnificently  —   but they were all Judith Leiber.” Now, nearly 100 of them are in New York’s Museum of Art and Design, in the first major museum exhibition of her work in more than 20 years. Show curator Samantha De Tillio says no woman would have carried an asparagus on her arm before Leiber came along. ”She, I think, introduced the idea that handbags could be whimsical and fun and that kind of humor could be appropriate for the red carpet or for a First Lady,” De Tillio explains. ”So I think she created the environment where women wanted something more, or different  —   and then filled it very successfully.” Leiber is now retired. She likes to sit in a comfy chair in her spacious,     Long Island home and read murder mysteries.  ”I was very happy with all the bags I made,” she says. ”I made all kinds of things, some of them were very classic, some of them were kind of crazy, but we did all kinds of things that I thought were very good.” Plenty of others agreed  —   and some spent several thousands of dollars to own one of her works of art. They’ve become not just collector’s items, but family heirlooms. In homage, many visitors arrive at the New York exhibit with Leiber bags on their arms.

"Fine-tuning your portfolio for the new year. The past year was not easy on investors. Between the crisis in Greece, the market turmoil of August and September, and the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, 2015 was a year to rattle nerves. The market's tumble at the start of 2016 trading is giving investors little reason to believe the new year will be any gentler. But before you go into a defensive crouch, remember that this could be a great time for you stop, think, and plan. You may have sold some losing positions at the end of 2015 and managed to reduce your upcoming tax bill. Good for you – and now you need fine tune your new investment mix. Experts recommend that you first determine your needs and priorities, and then decide which investment mix will match those needs. Your priorities may include things like your time horizon — or how long until you might need the money for other purposes — and your appetite for risk. Perhaps none of this has changed since you last rebalanced, but you still need to make sure your investment allocation reflects your goals. While it does not pay to rebalance too often (every time you do, you incur transaction costs and potentially realize investment gains), it's a good idea to consider doing so after you have harvested tax losses. Too often, people allow their portfolio mix to shift over time, which can be detrimental. Vanguard in November published a study on asset allocation, and found that for global assets under management in open-end and exchange-traded funds, stock allocations reached 62 percent on Dec. 31, 2006. They then fell as low as 38 percent in 2008, during the financial crisis. After years of solid or strong returns, stock exposure then rose to 56 percent as of Dec. 31, 2014. ""Assets under management,"" the report said, ""tended to drift based on market performance."" That kind of drift could pay off in the short run: If stock market returns are robust for two years in a row, holding off on rebalancing after year one would give you overexposure to a strong asset class. But allowing your exposure to one asset class to get too big can sharply increase the volatility in your returns. Vanguard analyzed calendar year investment returns from 1926 through 2014 and found that an all-stock portfolio would have delivered an annualized return of 9.7 percent. But returns for at least one year declined 43.5 percent. A portfolio invested half in stocks and half in bonds would have produced an annualized return of 8.1 percent, or 83.5 percent of the all-stock portfolio. But the balanced portfolio's worst annual return would have been a decline of 22.7 percent, roughly half as poor as the all stock portfolio's worst year. Risk appetite and investment time horizon are personal choices, but minimizing taxes is virtually a universal goal. To that end, it is a good idea to consider how rebalancing will affect your tax bill. If you are a long-term investor with some of your assets in a tax-sheltered account, consider concentrating your rebalancing moves there, according to analysts at Morningstar. ""Even if you sell winners that you hold within your 401(k) and IRA and use the proceeds to bump up your weightings in laggard holdings in those same accounts, you won't pay capital gains taxes,"" they wrote. If you do need to rebalance in a taxable account, you can avoid adding to your tax bill by using new money, rather than selling investments you already have. As for where to put your money, experts have no shortage of opinions. Inflation is one factor where views are shifting. ""Headline inflation will rise across developed markets, bringing core inflation closer to target,"" Goldman Sachs said in its 2016 outlook. That, in turn, could drive further interest rate hikes, the firm said — perhaps more than investors expect. In addition, Bilton wrote, the dollar's rise will likely slow after strong appreciation in 2015, which should allow corporate earnings to recover. As a result, he recommended being overweight on U.S. and European stocks. Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, expects ""low- to mid-single-digit"" returns for equities, a guardedly positive forecast. However, he is relatively optimistic about the financial and consumer discretionary sectors. Rebalancing can by unsettling: After all, when you do it, you are selling assets that have performed well and loading up on your recent losers. But rebalancing can help you from selling in a panic when markets experience a sudden fall, wrote Charles Rotblut, a vice president at the American Association of Individual Investors and the editor of its journal. ""Rebalancing lessens the blow of bear markets, making it easier to stick with stocks,"" he said. In addition, rebalancing restores a sense of control. Rather than being left wondering what the best decision is for your portfolio based on what the pundits are saying about market direction, you have a strategy that prompts you to act and gives direction on how to do it."" And, of course, having a strategy just may be the best investment plan of all.",0.0
" Instacart’s Tipping Transparency Issues Could Lead To Thanksgiving Strike.  Facing criticism from customers and threats of a strike from its   workers, Instacart is rolling out a software update intended to better explain the recent changes it has made to the pay and tips earned by the people that pack and deliver the groceries on which it has built its business. The move follows unrest among some of Instacart’s   workers, who are frustrated by a recent decline in   earnings, as well as by new contracts that include arbitration agreements that would preclude them from jointly suing the company. This growing coalition of Instacart workers is orchestrating a movement against the company via social media that includes calling in complaints to the Department of Labor and a possible strike intended to disrupt the company’s delivery operations during two busy shopping days leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. “Part of me feels bad because we may or may not be ruining people’s holiday, but this is a strike on Instacart,” said Melanie Sutton, a shopper in Chicago who plans to participate in next week’s boycott. She personally knows of seven other workers who plan to participate. “They’ll hopefully   everything after that. There’s only 20 (if that) shoppers in my zone. So if only a couple people are working, it’ll be a huge blow to Instacart out here. ” In September, Instacart changed how tipping works for the independent contractors  —   “full service shoppers” in Instacart parlance  —   who both shop for and deliver groceries to Instacart customers. Instead of defaulting to a tip that goes directly to the worker filling an individual order, the system now defaults to a service fee that is pooled among all Instacart workers, with the option to add an additional tip later on. Instacart had originally planned to kill tipping altogether, but outcry from workers  —   and customers, according to the company  —   caused them to alter course just before the changes rolled out. The goal of this update, according to Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta, was to stabilize pay and make the company more sustainable  —   a change he conceded would inevitably cause some workers to lose money. “We’re going to pay a fair and competitive wage in every single market,” Mehta told BuzzFeed News at the time. “If you’re getting more than that, it’s going to go down. And if you’re getting less than that, it’s going to go up. ” Workers who experienced a decline in wages were unsurprisingly upset by the loss in earnings, which they’ve estimated was around 30 to 40% of their Instacart income  —   a figure corroborated by a BuzzFeed News analysis of paystubs. Some reached out to Instacart customers to note that the change was hurting their livelihoods. “This service amount is not a tip, and won’t go directly to the shopper delivering your order,” reads a flyer that workers have been handing out to customers, which includes step by step directions to opt out of the service fee in favor of a tip. Some workers posting screenshots of their paystubs to two   Facebook groups say the tactic is working. Workers anecdotally report that they’ve received more tips recently than they did in the weeks immediately following the change. But not everyone is satisfied. In addition to mourning a decline in earnings, some Instacart workers are taking issue with the fact that Instacart is asking some of them to sign updated contracts, which reiterate Instacart’s existing arbitration agreement. Instacart was the subject of a   lawsuit from workers last year, but the case was sent to individual arbitration. Arns Law Firm, which represented the workers, tried to get the case reconsidered, but on Thursday, the judge denied their motion. Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and WeWork have all previously used arbitration clauses to evade   lawsuits. Arns has distributed information to workers encouraging them to take advantage of their opportunity to opt out of the arbitration agreement in the new contracts, but Instacart says the new arbitration agreements aren’t a change to its existing policy. “We update and revise shopper agreements from time to time they’ve always included an arbitration agreement,” Instacart communications director Rebecca u told BuzzFeed News in an email. “All new shoppers have been on the latest version of that agreement since March, right now we’re getting existing shoppers on the same agreement. ” But Jonathan Davis, an attorney with Arns, said the new arbitration clause is a “different agreement with new language that impacts rights. ” It’s unclear whether workers who opt out of the arbitration agreement will pursue a new class action lawsuit going in the future. The Instacart workers dismayed by the company’s decisions regarding their compensation and legal rights are now working to orchestrate a strike on Nov. 22 and 23. Their stated goal is to jam up Instacart’s system in the days leading up to Thanksgiving. Organizers, some with experience working in movements including the Fight for $15, OUR Walmart, and Occupy Wall Street, are pushing workers to walk out on shifts to which they’ve committed or refuse to fill orders they’ve accepted in hopes of sending a pointed message to the grocery delivery service. “I am boycotting because my income is 25% of what it used to be. ” Danielle Gage is a shopper in Boulder, Colorado, who plans to participate in the Thanksgiving strike. “I am boycotting because my income is 25% of what it used to be. Now $8 an hour is a “good” day,” she said via email. “Every time I have told a customer how the new service fee works they were outraged and Instacart simply doesn’t care. ” Though   Facebook groups have been growing, it’s unclear how many workers intend to boycott the platform next week. Some workers are planning a picket instead with a date tentatively set for early December. Still others have been calling the Department of Labor to complain, or reaching out to Instacart’s commercial partners to put the pressure on them. This momentum has led to the creation of a “National App Workers Guild” Facebook page in support of “Instacart shoppers who were voicing dissent over the removal of tips by Instacart. ” Instacart twice declined comment on the prospect of a   boycott. Meanwhile, some Instacart customers are also voicing frustration, saying they were unaware of how the company’s shift to a pooled service fee would impact the people that pack and deliver their groceries. They argue Instacart should have done a better job explaining what was going on with tips. “I read the sentence that described the service fee three times,” Instacart customer Danielle   told BuzzFeed News, “and I still couldn’t figure out exactly what I was paying for, and how it was different from the tip. ”   said if Instacart doesn’t take steps to address the confusion, she would seriously considering leaving the platform. “I read what it said in the app, and I was confused. ”  ’ complaint was echoed by other Instacart customers across Facebook and Twitter. Indeed, BuzzFeed News conducted an informal (and, yes, unscientific) survey of Instacart customers, to which around 5, 000 people responded. The overwhelming majority reported that they were unaware of the changes the company had made to its tipping structure and how it had impacted Instacart’s   workers. Instacart told BuzzFeed News it has so far refrained from emailing customers about the change in tipping procedure because it claims very few customers actually open and read its emails. Instead, this week, the company has been gradually rolling out language in its checkout flow that says “NEW: We now use a service amount to pay the shoppers that work on your order. ” The system still defaults to a 10% service fee, however, and there’s no specific mention of tips until you click on “Learn More. ” Customers also have the opportunity to tip after the delivery is completed. Elise Tribbey lives in Denver, where she uses Instacart to order groceries around once a month. The last time she used the platform, she noticed the introduction of the service fee, but “was unclear on where I was supposed to put the tip. ” Tribbey said she understands the importance of tips to workers because her husband works in the service industry. She said she’ll continue to use Instacart as long as tipping instead of paying the pooled service fee is an option. But if the fee were to become mandatory she “might reconsider. ” “I read what it said in the app, and I was confused,” she told BuzzFeed News. “So I googled and I think I learned more from the articles and Facebook posts than I did from Instacart. ”   ",-1.0
"We chuck out 31% of our food supply: How to stop the waste. Food statistics can have a way of zeroing in on our collective eating Zeitgeist with uncomfortable data points. For example, U.S. consumers waste up to 50 percent more food than Americans did in the 1970s, according to National Institutes of Health. And if you're assuming restaurants and farming are the sole culprits of food and agricultural waste, consider that a U.S. family of four discards around $1,500 a year on food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Decades ago, fresh food was less desirable, and even perceived as dangerous. You reached for a salted piece of fish or meat. Frozen food wasn't a pariah. Over the years, fresh food has become widely available and almost idealized objects — proof of better eating and living than prior generations. From kale to quinoa, a grain high in protein, it seems every crop wants to be the next big, super food hero. ""There is this whole idealization of fresh food,"" said James McWilliams, a history professor at Texas State University at San Marcos and author of ""Just Food,"" which tackles how to eat responsibly. And hunting for the freshest can easily turn into a game of what's the best-looking produce. A priority on food aesthetics in turn creates a chain reaction in the food-supply system. Blemished items can end up in landfills, which create greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Only the best specimens make the cut onto U.S. and global food shelves. ""A lot of product is excluded earlier in the supply chain because not everything grows that perfectly,"" said Dana Gunders, a scientist focused on food and agriculture for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Read MoreHow China is changing your dinner plate This desire for fresh, perfect food and the economics of farming are generating food and agricultural rubbish like never before. Producers sometimes throw out edible food because harvesting amid variable factors, like labor costs, can make processing unprofitable. In California, the nation's largest agricultural producer and exporter, 25 percent of all state landfill waste is food and agricultural waste, according to the University of California, Davis. And speaking of landfills, Whole Foods got dinged by a Twitter user for selling pre-peeled oranges in small, plastic containers. The retailer apologized and pulled the products. Oranges will be left alone in their natural packaging: Peels. Of course food insecurity and poverty are real problems in America. But that's part of a much bigger set of global, agriculture-related challenges. Globally, populations and food demand are forecast to grow, giving new urgency to food waste reduction goals. The world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from the current 7.3 billion, according to United Nations figures. Scientists and researchers are seeking waste reduction, including technology-based solutions to transform food and agricultural waste into converted energy. The end game is feeding people. Not landfills. U.S. food loss and waste accounts for about 31 percent of the overall food supply available to retailers and consumers, with far-reaching effects on food security and climate change, according to the USDA. Food loss and waste is single largest component of disposed U.S. municipal solid waste. With the need for solutions accelerating, the U.S. in 2015 issued its first-ever national food waste reduction goal, calling for a 50 percent cut by 2030. The solutions lie in public-private partnerships as well as individual changes in eating habits. In part because of the abundance of food choices and retailers, it's easy for consumers to chuck an edible head of romaine or hunk of cheese if they show only the slightest blemishes. ""The irony is that when people are in stores, they're so price sensitive. Ten cents will push them one way or another,"" said Gunders, also author of the ""Waste-Free Kitchen Handbook"" The book is a practical guide to preserving the shelf life of products, wasting less food and saving money. ""Nobody wants to waste food,"" she said. On the flip side, some in the food industry are exalting the qualities of imperfect or ugly foods to help solve world hunger. And there's more discussion about food expiration, and the difference between ""sell by"" and ""use by"" dates on packaging. ""Expired"" food doesn't necessarily have to be thrown away. Last year, Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe's, opened a nonprofit grocery store in the low- to middle-income neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston. The shelves feature surplus and aging food. ""We can offer these daily values by working with a large network of growers, supermarkets, manufacturers, and other suppliers who donate their excess, healthy food to us, or provide us with special buying opportunities,"" according to the Daily Table store. And creative food sourcing business models can help feed America's working poor. Read MoreWhat the future of food looks like ""Our whole food system is based on maximizing profit. It's not based on maximizing food use,"" said Gunders. Ruihong Zhang, a professor in UC Davis' biological and agricultural engineering department, invented the technology behind a commercial-grade, patented ""BioDigester."" It's designed to transform organic waste including food, yard and paper waste into biogas, which is then combusted to generate electricity and heat. Biogas can even be processed into renewable natural gas and transportation fuel. This scientific process is called anaerobic digestion and includes a series of biological processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. Waste is stored in large, oxygen-free tanks (called digesters) with microbes. The idea is farm to fork to fuel. One BioDigester on the UC Davis campus can transform about 50 tons of organic waste daily to generate roughly 16,500 kilowatt hours of electricity a day. The wastes comes from multiple sources, including campus dining halls, restaurants and grocery stores. There's a larger BioDigester in Sacramento in which 100 tons of organic waste (mostly food waste) is transformed into compressed renewable natural gas for fueling buses and trucks. Sacramento also has a smaller BioDigester, which takes in about 10 tons of waste per day. ""Agricultural waste is a big stream. But we can convert the waste to energy,"" Zhang said.

"Rubio gets boost from Republican endorsements, Cruz missteps.  Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio received boosts Monday in his drive to become the mainstream Republican alternative to   Donald Trump, with a string of   endorsements and missteps by rival Ted Cruz’s campaign. Rubio, who eked out a   finish in South Carolina’s primary by fewer than 1, 000 votes over Cruz on Saturday, racked up endorsements from prominent Republicans including U. S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and former presidential candidate Bob Dole. Rubio and Cruz came out of South Carolina with sharper criticism of Trump, who swept the Southern state with a comfortable margin of victory. At the same time, the two senators’ rivalry intensified   and soured. Cruz fired his main spokesman, Rick Tyler, on Monday afternoon over a video that falsely showed Rubio dismissing the Bible.  Tyler had apologized late on Sunday for posting ”an inaccurate story” involving a video purporting to show Rubio referring to the Bible and saying, ”Not many answers in it.” Tyler had retweeted a link to the misleading video and posted it on Facebook. Cruz fired Tyler the next day, saying his campaign did not question the faith of other candidates. ”That’s why I’m asking for Rick Tyler’s resignation,” Cruz said. The   senators from Texas and Florida are locked in a battle to become their party’s alternative to political outsider Trump in Nevada’s caucus on Tuesday, the last Republican presidential contest before the busy voting month of March.  Tyler’s dismissal came amid intense criticism of the Cruz campaign as dishonest from both Rubio and Trump. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant called Cruz a ”candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected” and urged him to apologize.  ”There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom, that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty,” he said. Trump seized the opportunity to pile on Cruz, whom he has repeatedly characterized as a liar.  ”Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!” the billionaire businessman from New York said on Twitter. ”Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! ,” continued Trump, who has derided Cruz for failing to live up to expectations he would get solid support from evangelical Christians in South Carolina.  Trump was the big winner in that state on Saturday, finishing ahead of Rubio by 10 percentage points.  Opinion polls show Rubio and Cruz running close in Nevada, and both candidates hope to get a boost going into the contests in a dozen states on March 1. Super Tuesday is the crown jewel in the    nominating contests to pick the Republican and Democratic candidates for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Rubio on Monday also secured the backing of three Republican leaders from Nevada: U. S. Senator Dean Heller and U. S. Representatives Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei.   Senator Hatch said that, unlike many in the Republican establishment, he did not dislike Trump. ”I just feel that Rubio is the more serious candidate. And I feel he has the background to be able to really help turn this mess around,” Hatch told Reuters.

"Russia quits International Criminal Court .  (CNN) Russia says it will withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) under a directive signed by President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the ICC had ”failed to meet the expectations to become a truly independent, authoritative international tribunal,” in a statement released Wednesday. It described the ICC as ”ineffective,” adding that ”during the 14 years of the court’s work it passed only four sentences having spent over a billion dollars.” Russia also criticized the court’s handling of the country’s   conflict with neighboring Georgia in 2008, saying ”we can hardly trust the ICC in such a situation.” Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte offered Putin his support before he left for APEC in Peru, also threatening to pull out of the court. ”They withdrew their membership. I might follow,” he said in a statement to the media. ”Why? It’s us small countries that get beaten up.” He reiterated his intention to align with China and Russia. ”If Russia or China will decide to create a new world order, I will be the first to join,” he said. ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said in a statement that ”membership of the Rome Statute is a voluntary and sovereign decision which is the prerogative of all states,” adding ”the ICC is respectful of each states’ sovereignty.” Under Wednesday’s directive, President Putin instructed his Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the UN Secretary General that Russia no longer intends to become a state party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC. Russia signed the treaty in 2000, but did not ratify it, according to the Russian Legal Information Agency. The Rome Statute has been ratified by 123 countries.  The US also previously signed the treaty, but under the Bush administration told the United Nations in 2002 it had ”no intention” of ratifying it. Based in the Hague, Netherlands, the ICC comprises 124 states from around the world. It is the ”court of last resort” and tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. Russia’s actions in Crimea, The announcement comes days after the ICC published a damning verdict on Russia’s actions in neighboring Crimea. The ICC said in a report released Monday that ”the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol factually amounts to an ongoing state of occupation.” Russia annexed Crimea, a territory in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, in 2014 following tensions with its neighbor.  World leaders managed to install a shaky peace deal in 2015. But violence continues in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, and 2016 has seen an increase in casualties. Criticism of Syrian ’war crimes’  President Putin’s directive also follows suggestions from French President Francois Hollande last month that Moscow was guilty of war crimes in Syria. Putin canceled a trip to Paris after Hollande told French TV station TF1 that those behind the bombardment of Aleppo    alluding to Syria and Russia    had committed ”war crimes” and should be held accountable at the International Criminal Court. Russia has carried out airstrikes in Syria since September 2015 in coordination with President Bashar  ’s regime.  This year South Africa, Gambia and Burundi also took actions to quit the International Criminal Court, according to the Russian Legal Information Agency. ",-1.0
"Police: Remains of missing Arizona girl found.  (CNN) An Arizona girl who disappeared from her home almost five years ago is dead, police in Tucson said Friday. The remains of Isabel Celis were discovered earlier this month during a search by authorities, Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said. ”This is not the ending that any of us hoped for but it is also not the ending of the case,” he said. Isabel was 6 when she disappeared from her Tuscon home in April 2012. She was last seen by family members when she went to bed at 11 p. m. on a Friday. When her father went to wake her at 8 a. m. Saturday    a   after her mother had gone to work    he said the girl was nowhere to be found, according to police. Police have followed 2, 200 leads in the case, which attracted national attention. No arrests have been announced and the chief would not discuss suspects at a news conference. The chief said Isabel’s remains were found in a rural part of Pima County, which includes Tucson. DNA from the remains was sent to a lab in Virginia, he said. ”Unfortunately, the results of this DNA analysis did confirm that the remains were those of Isabel Celis,” Magnus said. The chief said the discovery was not happenstance, but he declined to say what led officers to the site. CNN affiliate KGUN said the girl’s family released this statement: ”We want to thank the community for the support they have continued to show for Isa over the years and for refusing to give up hope. Now is our time to mourn. We ask for our privacy during this time so that we can do that.”",-1.0
"Frank Lloyd Wright in 5 buildings.  (CNN) Frank Lloyd Wright, considered by many to be the greatest American architect of all time, was born 150 years ago today. The mastermind behind more than 500 projects realized around the world over seven decades, he’s remembered for elegantly blending nature with the built environment. Here’s what his five most memorable buildings tell us about his life and work.  1910: Robie House (Chicago, Illinois)  In 1909, Frank Lloyd Wright left his wife and six children. In Europe, he met his lover, Martha ”Mama” Cheney, who had left her American husband to join him.   In Germany, Wright arranged publication of the Wasmuth Portfolio, 100 lithographs of his work to date. This was a revelation to the first generation of European modern architects. Work is said to have stopped for a day in the Berlin office of Peter Behrens, where the architect’s young assistants, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, pored over a first edition.  Read: New US embassies make an architectural statement, With their open plan floors, low roofs, ribbon windows and long horizontal lines, Wright’s Prairie Houses were distinctive and modern. Before Wright and Mama returned to the States, the most impressive of these was completed by Marion Mahony, Wright’s first assistant, and interior designer George Mann Niedecken for Frederick C. Robie, a   old Chicago businessman.  With its steel frame and brick skin, the construction of the house was considered highly advanced. Named a US National Historic Landmark in 1963, it has been under threat of demolition twice: in 1941 and again in 1957, both times by the Chicago Theological Seminary, its owner since 1926.  ”It all goes to show,” said Wright, ”the danger of entrusting anything spiritual to the clergy.”  Currently being returned to its original condition, the Robie House epitomizes the spirit of what was an original and wholly American architecture independent of European influence. 1923: Imperial Hotel (Tokyo, Japan)    The scandal over his flight to Europe ensured Wright was without new commissions for several years. Worse still, in 1914 a male servant set fire to Taliesin, the Wisconsin house he had built for Mama, and murdered her, her children and several members of staff with an axe as they fled.  The commission to design the new Imperial Hotel in Tokyo came as the architect’s salvation. A lifelong collector of Japanese prints, Wright visited the city multiple times, creating a   courtyard building fusing Eastern and Western themes, the latter expressed through his growing fascination with Mayan design.  Completed in 1923 by his Tokyo assistant Arata Endo, this quixotic hotel was, according to Wright, ”a system of gardens and sunken gardens and terraced gardens, of balconies that are gardens and loggias that are also gardens and roofs that are gardens.”  Kameki and Nobuko Tsuchiura, two young Japanese architects who had worked on the project, joined Wright’s team in Wisconsin. Nobuko was the first Japanese woman architect.  Although alluring in many ways, the Imperial floated on a mud plain. In May 1945 it had been partly destroyed by USAAF incendiary bombs, and it was occupied by American forces from 1945 to 1952. By the 1960s it had sunk deeper into the ground and in 1968 it was demolished.   If it existed today, this would surely be one of the world’s cult hotels. 1939: Fallingwater (Fayette County, Pennsylvania) With the effects of the Great Depression and the growing influence of a younger generation of   Modern architects, Wright’s career stalled.  In 1934, Edgar J. Kaufmann, a wealthy Pittsburgh department store proprietor, commissioned the    architect to design a weekend mountain retreat overlooking the waterfall at Bear Run in the Laurel Highlands 65 miles southeast of the city.  Wright wrote Kaufmann and his wife, Liliane: ”I want you to live with the waterfall, not just to look at it.”  Read: How tech revolutionizes architecture, The result was a highly original and beautiful house set directly over falling water that, while overtly modern, belonged to the landscape. A daring structure, its cantilevered riverfront sagged the moment the concrete formwork was removed, while damp seeping up from the waterfall    accessible by stair from the living     caused mold as   leaked.  It was hard, though not to fall in love with Fallingwater, its very name barely concealing that of ”FLW”. Together with its caped architect (Wright was always a showman) it made the cover of Time. The influential magazine described the exquisite house as the architect’s ”most beautiful job.”  Wright’s star was in the reascendant. A museum since 1964 and in danger of collapse by the end of the century, Fallingwater has been beautifully restored to enchant and inspire future generations.  A rhyme in a café on nearby Route 381 said ”Frank Lloyd Wright built a house over falling   he really shouldn’t have oughta.” Most of us are glad he did. 1959: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York)  Dreamed up in the   Wright’s designs for the Guggenheim    his only museum    were very much against the grain of the rectilinear modern European architecture that dominated New York and cities worldwide from the end of the Second World War.  A spiraling organic structure, rather like a Nautilus shell, the completed Guggenheim was a highly personal architectural statement rather than some rational analysis of function expressed in a grid of   angles.  Read: Innovative designs for communal living, From its opening six months after Wright’s death at the age of 91 (he had never stopped working) the Guggenheim was loved and loathed. Those who loved it reveled in its sense of freedom and daring, its radical architectural breaking from that of conventional museums and galleries. Those who loathed it took against its contrary design.  How could curators be expected to hang paintings, or visitors to contemplate them, along the walls of a continuously ascending, or descending, spiral? When curators questioned the low ceilings, Wright told them to ”cut the paintings in half.”  However controversial, the Guggenheim endeared Wright to New York’s media. In June 1956, he even appeared on the popular TV quiz show ”What’s My Line?”  The following September, he was the subject not once but twice, of ”The Mike Wallace Interview,” sponsored by Philip Morris and conducted in clouds of cigarette smoke, covering subjects from religion and sex to fame and architecture. Wright had become an American legend. He remained, though, a fierce individualist, refusing to ever join the American Institute of Architects. 1956: The Illinois (unrealized)  In October 1956, Wright unveiled his design for The Illinois, a sensational   skyscraper, at a press conference at Chicago’s gargantuan Hotel Sherman. The tallest of all skyscrapers, The Illinois was to have risen from the prodigious green acres of Chicago parkland.  Counterintuitively, or so it must have seemed, The Illinois was the   old architect’s riposte to the very idea of the city in general. As he told Mike Wallace on television when pressed on his religious beliefs, Wright said he spelled God with an ”n” rather than a ”g.” ”N” was for nature.  Read: Why we’re obsessed with building tall, Designed for 130, 000 tenants, The Illinois was Wright’s way of keeping the sheer horizontal sprawl of the American city in check. The   tower, with its twin helipads and 56   elevators, however, remained a dream, although it proved that Wright had become ever more radical with age, and that he was, as he had been since he first promoted his Prairie Houses, still a highly talented publicist.

"Portland, Oregon to demand controversial Uber software tool. Uber has acknowledged using the software, known as Greyball, to circumvent government officials who were trying to clamp down on Uber in areas where its service had not yet been approved, including Portland. It has since stopped the use of the software for that purpose, saying the program was created to check ride requests to prevent fraud and safeguard drivers Reuters reported on Thursday that the U. S. Department of Justice has begun a criminal investigation into Uber’s Greyball program, and that a Northern California grand jury had issued a subpoena to Uber concerning how the software tool functioned and where it was deployed. Portland began its own investigation of Greyball after the New York Times revealed its existence in March. Uber has shared some information with the city but has not turned over the Greyball software itself. In an interview on Friday, Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees the city’s transportation department, said his colleagues on the city council have pledged to support a subpoena against Uber, which will be voted on next week. If Uber does not comply, Portland could ultimately review its ability to operate in the city, Saltzman said. ”We are not ready to go there yet,” Saltzman said. In a statement, Uber’s general manager for Oregon Bryce Bennett said the company has ”fully cooperated” with Portland and provided relevant information to its investigation. The city said it found no evidence Uber used Greyball to avoid inspectors since Uber was allowed to operate there in 2015. Portland received its own subpoena from the Northern California grand jury for records relating to Uber’s activities, including emails between the city and the company or its representatives, according to a copy of the document reviewed by Reuters. The subpoena to Portland was issued on March 10, a week after the New York Times report. The Portland subpoena does not indicate what criminal laws are at issue in the probe. Likewise, Uber’s grand jury subpoena does not list any federal statutes that may have been violated, a source familiar with the document said. A subpoena from a grand jury is a request for documents or testimony concerning a potential crime. It does not, in itself, indicate wrongdoing or mean charges will be brought. In a statement, Saltzman said the city supports the federal investigation.

"Bernie Sanders: Bill Clinton’s Conduct with Women Was ’Deplorable’ - Breitbart. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Bill Clinton for his past “deplorable” behavior with women. [Sanders made the swipe at Sunday night’s Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, hosted by the Black Congressional Caucus Institute. Hillary Clinton said that she will talk to Bill “at the kitchen table” and use him as a goodwill emissary for her White House.  NBC News moderator Andrea Mitchell asked Sanders about his recent assertion that Bill Clinton’s conduct during the Monica Lewinsky affair was “disgraceful. ” Mitchell asked Sanders if he regretted the comment and even went so far as to say that he did not have to answer the reporter’s question in that case. Sanders, yet again, attacked Bill Clinton while also simultaneously calling the question frivolous, which is a tactic that he has commonly used. “I was asked a question. You know one of the things, Andrea, and that question annoys me,” Sanders said. “I cannot walk down the street, and Secretary Clinton knows this, without somebody telling me how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton. ” Mitchell defended Clinton, saying that Sanders did not have to answer the question. “I was asked a question  …     If i don’t answer it then it’s another front page,” Sanders said. “Yes, his behavior, was deplorable. Have I ever said anything about that?” Sanders continued. Sanders’s “deplorable” comment, paired with his assertion that he never said anything about it, is a study in contradictions. Hillary, meanwhile, said that Bill Clinton will be used “as a good will emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we’ve got. ” “It will start at the kitchen table, we’ll see where it goes from there,” Clinton said of her potential conversations with husband Bill in the White House.",1.0
"Bolivia suspends airline as Colombian crash probe points to lack of fuel.  Bolivian authorities on Thursday suspended the license of a tiny charter airline whose plane crashed in Colombia this week after apparently running out of fuel, killing 71 people and wiping out a Brazilian soccer team on its way to a regional cup final. Monday night’s disaster sent shock waves across the global soccer community and plunged Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation, into mourning. The small Chapecoense team was traveling on a charter flight operated by airline LAMIA Bolivia to the biggest game in its history, the final of the Copa Sudamericana. Investigators combing the crash site on a wooded hillside outside of Medellin found no traces of fuel in the wreckage of the BAe 146 made by Britain’s BAE Systems Plc, signaling that the crash may have resulted from lack of fuel.  International flight regulations require aircraft to carry enough reserve fuel to fly for 30 minutes after reaching their destination.  ”In this case, sadly, the aircraft did not have enough fuel to meet the regulations for contingency,” said Freddy Bonilla, secretary of airline security at Colombia’s aviation authority.    Bolivian authorities said they were suspending LAMIA’s operating license and replacing the management of its aviation authority to ensure a transparent investigation. It said that neither decision implied wrongdoing. Local media in Brazil, citing an internal document, reported an official at the Bolivian aviation agency called Celia Castedo raised concerns about LAMIA’s flight plan. The official urged the airline to come up with an alternative route because the 4 hour and 22 minute journey was the same length as the plane’s maximum flight range. The reports said the official, who could not be reached by Reuters for comment, did not have the power to stop the flight. A Colombian civil aviation document seen by Reuters confirmed the flight time was set to be 4 hours and 22 minutes. Medellin air traffic controllers asked the LAMIA pilot to wait while another flight made an emergency landing. Details on the length of the wait and problems with the other flight were not immediately available. Air traffic controller Yaneth Molina, who received the distress call, said in a letter written to colleagues that she had received death threats following the crash. ”I did all that was humanly possible and technically necessary to preserve the lives of the passengers, but unfortunately my efforts weren’t enough,” Molina wrote in her letter, which was later released to the press. A crackling recording obtained by Colombian media of Bolivian pilot Miguel Quiroga’s final words showed he told the control tower at Medellin’s airport that the plane was ”in total failure, total electrical failure, without fuel.”  He requested urgent permission to land, and then the audio went silent. LAMIA Chief Executive Officer Gustavo Vargas on Wednesday said the plane had been correctly inspected before departure and should have had enough fuel for about    hours. In such situations, it is at the pilot’s discretion whether to refuel, Vargas said.  Only 0. 5 percent of accidents on record were blamed on low fuel, according to the U. S.  Flight Safety Foundation. BRAZIL GRIEVES In the soccer club’s small farming hometown of Chapeco in southern Brazil, workers on Thursday erected temporary structures in the stadium to shelter the coffins of 51 victims   players, staff and journalists   expected to arrive back for an   wake on Saturday. Some 100, 000 fans, about half the city’s population, were expected to attend, as were Brazilian President Michel Temer and Gianni Infantino, president of world soccer governing body FIFA. On Wednesday night, when the Copa Sudamericana final had been scheduled, tens of thousands of fans assembled in tribute at Chapecoense’s arena and the stadium in Medellin of rival team Atletico Nacional.  ”We Brazilians will never forget the way in which Colombians have felt as their own the pain of this terrible disaster that ended the historic dream of Chapecoense,” Foreign Minister Jose Serra told the crowds in Medellin. Fox Sports Brasil, which lost six of its journalists in the crash, broadcast 90 minutes of a black screen in the time slot of Wednesday’s game. A spokesman for Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said an inspector for the agency and Colombian officials would transport the aircraft’s black boxes back to the United Kingdom, where the information will be downloaded. Only six on board the flight survived: three Chapecoense team members, a journalist and two Bolivian crew members. Some have wondered why Chapecoense used the charter company instead of a commercial airline. Club Vice President Luiz Antonio Palaoro said LAMIA had a track record of transporting soccer teams around South America, and it had used the airline before.  ”We are dealing with the humanitarian aspect of the families and the victims,” Palaoro told reporters in Chapeco. ”After that, we are going to have to think about restructuring the team and also the appropriate legal measures.” Among surviving players, goalkeeper Jackson Follmann’s right leg was amputated, while defender Helio Neto was in intensive care with severe trauma to his skull, thorax and lungs. Fellow defender Alan Ruschel had spinal surgery.  Two of the Bolivian flight crew, Ximena Suarez and Erwin Tumiri, were bruised but not in critical condition, while journalist Rafael Valmorbida was treated in intensive care for multiple rib fractures that partly collapsed a lung. Tumiri may soon be released, local press reported.

"Juba Gripped by Renewed Violence as Factions Clash in South Sudan - The New York Times. JUBA, South Sudan  —   Armed clashes between two factions and waves of heavy gunfire spread across South Sudan’s capital on Sunday, a day after the nation’s fifth anniversary of its independence. Military helicopters swooped over the city, Juba, and armored vehicles rolled through streets, witnesses said. People took shelter in their homes and hid beneath their beds as the sounds of guns and heavier weapons rose, fell and rose again. “We are fighting at Gudele, Rock City and Jebel,” said William Gatjiath Deng, a spokesman for Vice President Riek Machar, referring to neighborhoods and suburbs of Juba. “There are a lot of bodies. I can’t even count them. ” Each side blamed the other for initiating the new outburst of violence. Michael Makuei, South Sudan’s information minister, said President Salva Kiir would soon declare a “unilateral  . ” The United Nations peacekeeping mission in the country wrote on Twitter that a “heavily armed exchange” had occurred near its base around 8:30 a. m. “The heavy artillery has been continuing since morning,” Shantal Persaud, a spokeswoman for the mission, said late Sunday afternoon. “The civilians have not been able to move from our accommodation” at the mission’s base near Jebel. Even as people sought refuge in their homes, witnesses reported that officers were knocking on doors in some neighborhoods, checking identity cards. The renewed violence broke a short and uneasy calm on Saturday, after fighting had erupted Friday. That violence is reported to have killed at least 150 people, with the toll expected to rise because casualties were still being counted. Factions of the South Sudanese Army loyal to Mr. Kiir and those backing Mr. Machar, who until this year led a rebellion against the government, have been fighting throughout the capital since Thursday, when the two sides confronted each other at a roadside checkpoint. Five government soldiers were killed in those exchanges. Fighting broke out again the next day as the two leaders were meeting. The United States said it had met with representatives of the South Sudanese leadership on Saturday and had received assurances that the fighting would stop. The United States helped engineer South Sudan’s independence from Sudan and still wields influence in the country. On Sunday, however, gunfire erupted again, spreading to different parts of the capital, including near the main army barracks and Juba International Airport. In New York, the United Nations Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Sunday afternoon to address the South Sudan crisis, the council announced on Twitter. In an email, J. Peter Pham, the director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said it was unclear how much sway Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar and other faction leaders in the “  transition government” had over their fighters. “Between the collapse of oil prices and the destruction they themselves wrought in the civil war, South Sudan is so destitute that there are no resources with which the country’s rulers might employ to bring their followers to heel,” Mr. Pham said.",-1.0
"Celebrities getting political at the Oscars? Give them an award. Being both old enough and shallow enough to remember the once seemingly annual horror of Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins’ political speeches at the Oscars, I understand why so many people experience a kind of inner death when celebrities heave themselves up on their political high horse at award ceremonies. From Vanessa Redgrave denouncing the Jewish Defense League as “Zionist hoodlums” in 1978 to Jared Leto giving a shout out to “all the dreamers  …     in the Ukraine and Venezuela” in 2014, the list of celebrities dabbling in politics at the Academy Awards is only slightly more impressive than Donald Trump’s movie cameos. So I get why people feel weary at best, disgust at worst about the inevitable   we’ll get at tomorrow night’s Oscars. Trump supporters will sneer at the    hysterical elitists who think they have a right to tell us normal folk what to do. As journalist (and daughter of John) Meghan McCain put it after the Golden Globes last month: “This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don’t start recognising why and how  —   you will help him get  . ” People voted Trump for lots of reasons but I don’t think a desire to stick it to Meryl Streep was one of them. Meanwhile liberals have been making similar arguments, if in less strident tones. They say that overpaid celebrities railing against the government will only turn the current political situation into an even bigger culture war: coastal elites versus   midwesterners. And that only helps Trump. Bipartisan as this take increasingly is, I don’t have much truck with it. Maybe it’s because there is something pretty hilarious about people saying celebrities shouldn’t talk about politics, when a celebrity is currently the president of the United States. The suggestion that actors are too privileged to talk to us ’umble,   peasants would work better if a Manhattan billionaire who lives in a literal golden palace hadn’t been elected on the basis that he really understands the average American. Celebrities are, after all, free citizens, and last time I checked, the US wasn’t a totalitarian state where criticism of our Dear Leader is forbidden on TV. But I’m guessing Steve Bannon is working on that. I am writing this from America, and, over here, President Trump is the only story in town. Whether people support or fear him, he is the first and last topic of conversation for pretty much everyone I’ve talked to over the past fortnight. For American celebrities not to acknowledge this would make them look a lot more cosseted by privilege than a dislike of the president. Yes, there will be total uniformity of political opinion at the Oscars: the awards take place in California, after all, a solidly Democrat state. And yes, the president can then spin that as proof of liberal elitism. But if everyone avoided doing things that might be reframed negatively by the president, they wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning. And some things are just plain wrong, whatever your politics: the president spreading false rumours about voter fraud and Swedish terror attacks the senate voting to defund Planned Parenthood, the primary health provider for many   women. So if Republican celebrities aren’t speaking up  —   Robert Duvall, say, or Adam Sandler  —   well, maybe they don’t fancy defending the indefensible. For every two celebrities (Viola Davis, Meryl Streep) who speak brilliantly about politics there will be at least 20 (Madonna, Tom Hiddleston) who put their gilded foot in it, which is pretty much the average ratio for humans in general. I’m OK with that. Everyone who feels strongly about these issues has a right to protest, and that includes gratingly   celebrities at massively   events. If you don’t want to hear celebrities wanging on, maybe just don’t watch the Oscars. I hear there are other TV channels out there. Celebrity protests rarely change things. After all, as President Trump and his supporters are keen to point out, all the celebrities in the world  —   and I mean that pretty much literally  —   couldn’t help Hillary Clinton get elected. But they certainly rattle the current president, a man so desperate to be recognised by Hollywood he insisted on appearing in Home Alone 2. Chipping away at his insatiably needy ego may well be one of the more powerful tools against him. For the first time in history, telling celebrities not to talk about politics sounds a lot less like sensible advice, and a lot more like a means of stifling powerful protest.",-0.5
"Journalists Hound Nate Parker, Acquitted for Rape Charge Bill Clinton Walks Free - Breitbart. Fox Searchlight may dramatically alter its promotional campaign for upcoming film The Birth of a Nation, because it fears that journalists will   a    rape case where    Nate Parker was acquitted of all charges. [At the same time, former President Bill Clinton has yet to face a question about the public resurfacing of one rape accuser, Juanita Broaddrick  —   even receiving excuses from a   blogger who admits that she finds Broaddrick’s story credible.  Variety reports that the film studio might ditch a “roadshow” promotional tour with Parker precisely because the press will hound him on this old issue: Despite the fact that Parker was acquitted of the rape charges in 2001, there are still concerns inside Fox Searchlight that the complicated issues raised by the case could overshadow a movie that was expected to be an Oscar  . Parker’s   on the film, Jean Celestin, was found guilty of sexually assaulting the same    female, who claimed to be unconscious, after a night of drinking. Celestin appealed the verdict and was granted a new trial in 2005, but the case never made it back to court after the victim decided not to testify again. According to sources, studio executives at Searchlight are assessing the fallout from a fresh round of stories about the incident on prominent news sites and    sites. The studio held a meeting on Monday morning with Parker’s team, and they are considering not granting new interviews with Parker from now until the movie debuts at the Toronto Film Festival in September. The hope is that by addressing the case well in advance of the movie’s festival run and October 7 debut, Parker can put it behind him by the time audiences get to see the movie. Searchlight is also still trying to determine what the impact of the 1999 Penn State case will have on Parker as the face of the “The Birth of the Nation. ” Part of the sales agreement for the film called for the label to support a roadshow that would have sent Parker around the country, to churches and college campuses, discussing issues of social justice. But each public appearance runs the risk of journalists or audience members reviving details of the court case and raising difficult questions. Journalists, however, have not started such a feeding frenzy for the much more powerful, much more public, and much more white figure of Bill Clinton. In January of this year, Juanita Broaddrick bypassed the press and posted her allegation to Twitter. The post went viral, with over 47, 000 retweets at the time of this writing. I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me.  I am now 73  …    . it never goes away.  —   Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016,  Since then, no journalist has directly asked Clinton about Broaddrick or her story. Not that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has given them much opportunity  —   Bill has not given any    interviews since last fall, and neither he nor Hillary have held a press conference in 2016. The establishment press and its defenders will likely object that Broaddrick’s allegations have received a fresh round of coverage, specifically from BuzzFeed’s Katie J. M. Baker this week. Yet this article is a wonderful example of “BenSmithing”  —   giving the establishment the excuse of having covered a story when asked why they are not pursuing a story. Baker’s interview with Broaddrick sheepishly accepts a “no comment” from Clinton spokesmen, depicts Broaddrick as a poor soul whose credibility has been undermined by   partisans, and generates some negative headlines for Donald Trump. Now when readers demand a direct question to Bill Clinton, BuzzFeed and their    Twitter buddies can link to Baker’s article and dismissively say, “We already covered that. ” Even more disturbingly, one reaction to Broaddrick’s recent resurgence says that Bill might be guilty and that’s okay with me. Rebecca Schoenkopf of Wonkette writes: To sum up, I think Bill Clinton could very well have raped Juanita Broaddrick that it doesn’t make him an evil man, or irredeemable (I’m Catholic we’re all forgiven, if we’re sorry, and Broaddrick says Bill Clinton personally called her up to apologize). It doesn’t even necessarily make him a bad feminist  —   you know, later, once he stops doing that. Let’s bring this back to Nate Parker. His big break as a filmmaker is under threat because he, as a    poor, black college student, was accused of   sex. And despite being young, poor, and black, the justice system declared him innocent. Since then he has proclaimed faith in Christ, married, and become a father to five children. Yet journalists are not willing to let this story go. On the other hand, Bill Clinton in 1978 was already powerful, serving as Arkansas’ Attorney General politically connected and white. He was never charged. Similar allegations of sexual assault continued to pop up for decades from many other women. He has never expressed remorse or admitted guilt  —   even in settling a sexual harassment lawsuit. And when he, as the most powerful man in the country, had an affair with a    White House intern, he was impeached and eventually disbarred for lying under oath. Yet journalists continue to ignore, downplay, or obfuscate his accusers’ charges. Sex scandals mean big business for the news  —   which leads reporters to blow up old,   stories like Nate Parker’s into fresh controversies. However, there appears to be something magical about the last name “Clinton” that keeps them from pursuing these stories with anything close to their typical zeal.",1.0
"What Made Pruitt’s Falsehood Go Viral? . As many soon noticed, these statements were often  …     surprisingly similar. They seemed to attest more to careful   than to some new   consensus. With tremendous reliability, every answer about the issue consisted of two parts. A nominee first recognized the reality of “some” global warming —  sounding appropriately grave and concerned about it —  before they pivoted to casting doubt on whether humans were behind this warming, or even whether a human influence could ever be known at all. “Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,” said Scott Pruitt, the future administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. (That’s part one.) “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be. ” (Part two.) “The risk of climate change does exist. The increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is having an effect,” said Rex Tillerson, future secretary of state. (Part one.) “Our ability to predict that effect is very limited. ” (Part two.) “I do not believe it is a hoax,” said Ryan Zinke, the future secretary of the interior. (Part one.) “I think where there’s debate on it is what [the human] influence is, what can we do about it. ”(Part —  well, you know.) These answers weren’t necessarily true, but they were milder and more reasonable than outright denial. They prompted coverage in The New York Times and The Washington Post, which noted the new position was “more nuanced” and “less urgent” while also noting that it wasn’t, well, correct. As Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, told the Post: “It sounds like an orchestrated campaign of    . The scientific consensus is clear: Most of the warming since 1950 is the result of the buildup of the   greenhouse gases. ” But even as scientists and some journalists shook their heads, Trump nominees’ statements were amended, and not outright rejected, in the broader public conversation. My own work testifies to that: My headline about Tillerson’s hearing announced that he believes in climate change, even as I corrected what was incorrect about his scientific summary. I also wondered if his kinder, softer line pointed to a “potential shift in the Republican Party’s treatment” of the issue.   Compare that to what happened last week. On Friday, Scott Pruitt told a CNBC host that he didn’t believe carbon dioxide to be a primary contributor to   climate change. He also said he hoped for more study and debate of the issue. This is extremely wrong. Decades of research have established that carbon dioxide, emitted by human industrial activities, traps heat in the atmosphere and boosts global temperatures. It is a scientific fact, as surely as the simple pull of gravity or the miracle of photosynthesis is a scientific fact. But if you go back and read Pruitt’s comments from January above, he doesn’t contradict himself. And yet this time, the public leaped in to correct him. My inbox soon filled up with comments from pastors, politicians,   scientists, and former military leaders. So many people called Pruitt’s main telephone number to complain that the EPA had to set up an impromptu call center. And Keith Seitter, the executive director of the American Meteorological Society, wrote a public letter to Pruitt. “We understand and accept that individuals and institutions both public and private can reach differing conclusions on the decisions and actions to be taken in the face of this reality [of climate change],” Seitter said. “But mischaracterizing the science is not the best starting point for a constructive dialogue. ” “We are not familiar with any scientific institution with relevant subject matter expertise that has reached a different conclusion,” he added. Then the TV segments started. The Weather Channel packaged a   for television, then fired it off in a tweet retweeted by thousands. “It is simply not true that there is disagreement among scientists,” Carl Parker, a hurricane specialist for the network, told viewers. The new EPA Administrator states he does not believe that CO2 is the leading cause of global warming, but science proves otherwise. pic. twitter.  Then Al Roker, the Today show host, went on MSNBC to correct Pruitt. “The fact is, carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse gases, is responsible for climate change,” he said, sounding his best I’     notes. “There is no credible science or scientist who will tell you the contrary. ” “Look, this is America and you can make whatever statements you want to, but everybody will pretty much agree [on the science],” he added. Roker also prevailed on Pruitt to fund climate research at the agency. You know what they say: If a   host of Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is correcting your science on national television, and you’re the newly appointed head of the EPA, then, well, yikes. By the end of the brouhaha, both Stephen Colbert and the New York Post had covered the meteorology community’s mass rebuttal. That is all to say: On Friday, for the first time in his national political career, Pruitt played himself. He stepped in it. And why? What did he gain? Previously, he’d been spouting off incorrect statements about climate change —  the Times even tepidly labeled him a “denialist” —  but it was this untruth that prompted a mass response when the other statements did not. Now, accusations of   denial will dog him for years —  in the press, on   television, and when he his EPA goes to the courts. In part, this statement blew up because people notice what comes out of the mouth of from sitting government officials much more than they notice old quotes from government nominees. It’s also partly because this was a more unambiguously false statement. Most journalists could not quickly update you on the state of the art of   forcing measurement, but they can tell you that carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas. Virtually all scientists can do the same. Part of what happened here has to do with the curious strictures of mainstream journalism about climate change. Most American journalists still aspire to be nonpartisan. But on this one issue, most also know that only one U. S. political party talks about the science in a way that    conforms to reality. (Mitt Romney and some of the members of his campaign have become notable exceptions.) Journalists covering climate change are constantly correcting obviously wrong Republican claims. This makes it harder for many to fact check the other, more waffley quotes that waft by. Many are loosely phrased and   but they contain little truth content. An example is Pruitt’s line from his confirmation hearing: “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of [the human] impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be. ” There is some kind of invisible consensus around questions of climate change. Say an obvious untruth and be mocked the world over. Say a   vapidity —  which has the same import as an outright lie —  and you don’t wind up on Colbert. I suspect that an effect like this exists across politics, but it is surprising to see it so clearly on this one issue, where scientific agreement on reality is so strong.",-0.5
"Los Angeles is a transportation tech powerhouse – TechCrunch. Eric Pakravan
Contributor



		Eric Pakravan is a senior associate at Amplify.LA. Los Angeles is famous for two things: entertainment and traffic. Back in the 1950s, any association with “stars” and “cars” would be the envy of any modern city. But today, that’s sometimes overshadowed by images of aggressive paparazzi and gridlocked freeways. Thankfully, over the last five years, the emergence of big content-centric startups like Maker Studios, Hulu and even Snapchat has shown that LA can embrace its Hollywood DNA to fuel its burgeoning tech scene. But when it comes to transportation, there might be more to LA than just bloated commute times. Intrinsically, anyone from LA knows that we spend far too much time thinking and talking about traffic (if you haven’t seen SNL’s rendition of “The Californians,” that should give you an idea). In a normal city, weather is a standard conversation starter. But in a city with 329 days of sunshine, conversations here naturally begin instead with a serious discussion about traffic and commute schedules. All that discussion of gridlock may make it seem like we don’t have our act together when it comes to transportation. But if that’s the case, why did Elon Musk choose to build his Mars-chasing SpaceX in LA? Or why did Bay Area-based Shervin Pishevar choose downtown LA for the HQ of Hyperloop One? And why did Chinese giant LeEco choose sunny Southern California as the home for their ambitious electric self-driving car company, Faraday Future? Simple: LA is a powerhouse in transportation technology. This isn’t a new development, either. LA has been a leading transportation technology center for decades. Since the Lockheed Corporation made its home in Burbank in 1928 (as it happens, the same year Warner Bros. moved its studios to Burbank), LA has been consistently churning out new, transformative modes of transportation. The first space shuttle was built in LA county, as were all four of NASA’s Mars Rovers. For a time, Boeing was Southern California’s largest employer. And NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena actually predates NASA itself. When JPL was established next to Caltech in 1936, it was already developing next-gen rocket launchers and early lunar landers. Only after NASA was formed by Eisenhower in 1958 did JPL transfer to NASA’s control. Today, JPL is most well-known for building and managing NASA’s fleet of Mars Rovers, and it funnels talent to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. It’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. Southern California’s engineering talent continues to be the leading factor for LA’s continued success in delivering bleeding-edge transportation tech. Even with early LA mainstays like Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman moving the bulk of their manufacturing divisions outside of California to states with lower labor costs, all three continue to maintain sizable engineering departments in Southern California. Not only that, but the LA area’s nine engineering schools, including those at Caltech, USC, UCLA and Harvey Mudd, continue to graduate top-quality talent for companies like SpaceX, Boeing and, now, Hyperloop One. In fact, LA graduates more engineers than any other U.S. metro area. That statistic is referenced freely by LA’s startup community in an effort to encourage more LA-based software startups. While that statistic is often taken to mean that LA graduates a lot of programmers (which it does), in reality, a large portion of those engineers are also your PhD-level aerospace engineers, graduate-level electrical engineers and Caltech mechanical engineering grads. Not exactly your stereotypical programmer, right? But it’s exactly those engineers you need to build next-generation modes of transportation, and LA has no shortage of them. Even beyond Hyperloops and aerospace, the strength of LA’s university system continues to lead the way in bringing new edge-case transportation solutions to market. Case in point, TallyGo, an LA-based real-time navigation startup, was spun out of technology originally developed in-house at USC’s IMSC institute. The company has since raised millions in funding from local investors and is now taking on mapping giants like Waze, Google and Apple Maps. And, believe it or not, LA even leads the nation in traffic mitigation; in 2012, LA was the first major city to sync all its traffic lights. That technology has increased the speed of traffic by 16 percent, reduced travel times in the city by 12 percent and, like a scene out of Fast & Furious, can be used to automatically reprioritize key travel lanes in times of emergency. With such a strong foundation, it’s no surprise that prominent engineers, investors and entrepreneurs are proactively building their transportation ventures in LA. In the not too distant future, self-driving cars from Google, Uber, Tesla or LA’s Faraday Future may eliminate the city’s traffic woes. Hyperloop One could eliminate travel time between LA, SF, Vegas, San Diego and Phoenix. And one day, you might even be able to hitch a first-class ride to Mars — courtesy of LA-native, Elon Musk.",0.0
"'Inflation dragon' still slumbering, but could awaken soon | TheHill. With executive orders, high-level firings, demonstrations and confirmation hearings dominating the headlines recently, inflation has been far from most people’s minds. Only the hard-core professionals noticed the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index and even the professionals did not get too excited. To put it simply, inflation is still not a big deal in the U.S. The PCE price index was up 1.7 percent in December compared to a year ago. The PCE is the rate targeted by the Fed, not the better known Consumer Price Index (CPI). The 1.62 percent reading was still below the Fed’s objective of 2 percent inflation, but it was a modest increase from recent months. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the PCE rose a still rather restrained 1.70 percent. Low inflation would usually be good news, but we are in a bit of an odd situation. The economy has been expanding since mid-2009, even if most people don’t believe it. Economic growth has been muted, however. Unemployment is pretty low, but there are still relatively large numbers of people who probably would accept a job if they could find one. In the past, unemployment numbers like these would indicate a tight labor market, with few applicants for jobs and rising wages. In 2017, we see some modest signs of increased wage growth, but not the kind of tight labor market one might expect. The Fed has learned from past experience to be very proactive about inflation. When it sees inflationary pressures building, particularly in the form of rising wages, it tightens monetary policy by raising interest rates.  With interest rates at the lowest levels since the 1960’s, the Fed has already made two teeny steps toward higher rates. It raised the federal funds rate target from 0-0.25 percent to 0.25-0.5 percent in December 2015, and raised it again to 0.5-0.75 percent in December 2006. This all sounds like a story of ho-hum technocratic reactions to economic circumstances. But, as we all know, nothing is ho-hum these days. The leadership at the Fed believes that the time has come to withdraw some of the monetary stimulus provided in the dark days of the Great Recession, since the economy has mostly recovered. But the new administration is talking about adding substantial stimulus. President Trump campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that seems likely to increase the federal budget deficit. Presidential adviser Stephen Bannon has said he wants to increase demand pressure in the economy to drive up wages, in keeping with candidate Trump’s promise to help low-income workers. This kind of talk does not sit well with the Fed leadership. They are unlikely to allow inflation to spiral past 2 percent. New York Fed Chairman William Dudley, in another context, pointed out that U.S. recessions do not die a natural death, but are killed by the Fed’s interest rate hikes aimed at keeping inflation under control. Could this scenario play out in the coming months? The political uncertainties are enormous. The White House and Congressional Republicans have yet to reach a unified budget proposal, let alone to pass legislation. Many Congressional Republicans and the President’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pick are deficit hawks. However, Congressional Republicans did approve large deficits under both the Reagan and W. Bush administrations, so it is not a foregone conclusion that a deficit-increasing budget would be blocked. On the economic side, the latest report suggests that the inflation dragon has still not roused itself. The sluggish global economy is also dampening the inflationary fires.  The Fed promised multiple increases in the fed funds rate, but held off in 2016. If the budget is not highly expansionary, this could continue. There are also crazy things that could happen. Trade wars could raise prices, but also slam economic growth. The end result might be another recession, and the Fed might respond by returning to monetary stimulus. But all that is well in the nebulous realm of speculation for the moment. Dragons may be about, but they are not yet close enough for us to discern.   Evan Kraft specializes in the economics of transition, monetary policy and banking issues as a professor at American University.

"The Accountant review – Ben Affleck autism thriller doesn’t add up. “Sooner or later, difference scares people. ” The Accountant puts that sentiment in the mouth of a military man (Robert C Treveiler) explaining the tough ways of the world to his autistic, bullied son. But it could as easily be said by the director Gavin O’Connor, who has put together a drama so familiar and formulaic that even the most timid viewer will be comforted. Or, more likely, anesthetized. The Accountant is committed to a pretense of difference. Its protagonist, Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is autistic. As he explains, he has trouble understanding what other people are thinking, he can’t pick up on social cues, he gets deeply absorbed in tasks  —   especially mathematical tasks  —   and he panics when he is unable to finish them. As a child (played by Seth Lee) he rocks uncontrollably, throws violent tantrums, wears unsightly glasses, and checks a number of the Hollywood boxes for “geeky” and “different”. As an adult, Chris is supposed to be geeky and odd as well. In fact, though, the film comfortably and predictably presents autism as a superpower, which turns a Clark   accountant into the usual super action hero. Chris’s lack of affect, leavened with an occasional corny quip, isn’t that different from the taciturn manliness of James Bond. His incredible math abilities fit neatly into standard manly  . He’s even got a superhero origin story: to teach him to protect himself from bullies, his dad had him train with top combat specialists around the world. In one inevitable scene, we see young Chris training with a martial arts specialist in Jakarta, because superheroes always follow the Orientalist path east to learn their awesome special abilities. Affleck spends most of the film stoically not reacting. He might as well still be playing Batman. The one variation from Hollywood action default is the relationship with accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) which instead follows the Hollywood formula that disabled people don’t get to have    romances. Kendrick does her best with a relatively small role, bringing a modicum of wit and energy to the lugubrious script. Despite all the tropes working against them, she and Affleck have a subdued, sweet chemistry, which might have carried a romantic comedy version of The Accountant, if only the   had been willing to give it a chance. But instead we get an action movie plot which is drearily rote in its studied insistence on surprise. The narrative is intricately constructed, yet ersatz and shapeless, like a clock with Nerf gears. Christian uses his super math abilities to balance the books for criminal enterprises. He’s being pursued by the treasury department, led by Ray King (JK Simmons) and Marybeth Medina (Cynthia  ) and so decides to take on a legitimate client, a robotics company that has just discovered an irregularity in the books. That’s where he meets Dana, the company accountant who discovered the irregularity. And then both of them are targeted for death, leading to car chases,   fisticuffs and much choreographed violence. You know the drill. An action movie doing its action movie thing would be fine  —   what else do you go to an action movie for? But The Accountant has that deadly action movie vice, pretensions to cleverness and emotional weight. Flashbacks, and then more flashbacks, and then still more flashbacks fill in an extensive and tedious backstory, which includes not only Chris’s childhood struggles with his autism, but gangland hits, prison time, parental death and on and on. Tragic backstories are parceled out to all, even the treasury agents, and the conclusion of the film devolves into a series of overdetermined twist revelations. This treasury agent has a surprising history with Chris, that villain has a surprising history with Chris, this autistic girl who helped Chris finish a puzzle when he was a child has a very important role. Chris’s brother appears in a denouement so    I and the person sitting next to me both groaned aloud. The film ends with a sincere declaration of the worth and value of the  . An empathetic therapist explains to a concerned couple: “Your son’s not less than. He’s different. ” But how sympathetic to autistic people is the film really when, in order to be a hero, an autistic person has to be a   fighting machine exactly the same as all the other   fighting machines?  Geoff Todd, a writer whose child is autistic, wrote after seeing The Accountant’s trailer about Hollywood’s obsession, from Rain Man on, with autistic people who have amazing abilities. “My child was diagnosed with autism about six years ago, at least once a week we are asked what his special skill is,” Todd says. “Here we sit, in 2016, and yet another film is attempting to frame the diagnosis as one with the particular perk of advantage, a savant like quality. ” The Accountant uses a cliched and misleading presentation of disability to produce a cliched Hollywood action lead in a cliched action plot, and then babbles cliches about the importance of embracing difference. Despite its protestations to the contrary, the only thing that sets The Accountant apart from its peers is its irritating, clueless hypocrisy, and its lousy title.",-0.5
"TV Politics vs. Movie Art. George Clooney’s relentless effort to remake what he fantasizes as the politically forthright American films of the 1970s makes him both a bore and an easy target. It turns out that the movies Clooney prizes  —   Network, All the President’s Men, The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor  —   were politically fatuous though none of them were so fatuous as his own Syriana, Michael Clayton, The Monuments Men, The American, The Descendants, The Good German, The Ides of March, The Men Who Stare at Goats, and Good Night, and Good Luck, or his new film, Money Monster. It should be open season on such unintelligent grandstanding. In Money Monster, Clooney plays Lee Gates, the host of a financial TV program, who is held hostage (live,   with a gun at his head and wearing a   vest) by a disgruntled viewer whose life savings were lost to one of Gates’s careless recommendations. Money Monster (also the name of Gates’s program) pretends to expose Wall Street chicanery at the same time as critiquing opportunistic television. Who do Clooney, director Jodie Foster, and lead screenwriter Jamie Linden think they are? The   reincarnation of Paddy Chayefsky? Clooney’s Gates looks like a    composite he’s   blandly handsome, yet haggard. His attempts at frenetic    pay tribute to Peter Finch’s hyperactive Howard Beale  —   but did Clooney forget that Howard Beale was insane? Clooney must regard Beale as a prophet, and so he dances around and then tears up to convince the audience that TV stars are their friends. Roberts gets off a crack  —   “We don’t do journalism here. We don’t do journalism, period. ” But she ends the fracas with a warning: “The studio is in control. ” *      *      * Terence Davies’s Sunset Song, a personalized tale about young Christine Guthrie (Agyness Deyn) growing up in rural Scotland just before World War One, is also a national epic about one’s connection to a culture through language and the land. Consciousness of being female in an era when women were as subject to biology as they were to social customs, Chris is   and still in control of her body and her passions. Though tyrannized by her gruff, authoritarian father (Peter Mullan) Chris displays remarkable cultural sensitivity more so than her insolent brother Will (Jack Greenlees) whose sensitivity suffers under patriarchy  —   he runs off to Canada seeking personal freedom. Straightaway, Sunset Song (adapted by Davies from the 1932 novel by Lewis Grassic Gibbon) disrupts the typical modern narrative about what progressive college courses call “gender relations. ” Chris’s patriotism is almost animistic  —   something greater than   roots her to her culture. She’s a Scot even when she eventually resents the conscription laws that, during the war, separate her from her husband, Ewan (played by Kevin Guthrie). Davies finds a strength of character  —   and real ambivalence  —   that most contemporary filmmakers deny in favor of shallow political correctness but that was customary in   emotionally sustained movie epics. Because of this richness, Sunset Song rouses a sense that they don’t make movies like this any more. But the fact is, they never really did. Sunset Song is a fulfillment of Davies’s individual filmmaking style. This    project is accomplished without concession to marketplace gimmicks. Davies luxuriates in grand storytelling traditions even while boldly collapsing time into quirks of memory and shifting expansive panoramic exteriors into interiors of symbolic psychological intensity. Such scenes as the townspeople of Blawearie trudging through radiant wheat fields on the way to a spare,   chapel (singing the traditional “All in the April Evening”) or Chris undressing next to a framed sampler of the Beatitudes, mix the physical and the spiritual life. The film is an amazing feat of tension and harmony. These moments (and there are many more) recall masterpieces like How Green Was My Valley, Ryan’s Daughter, and Sons and Lovers, yet Davies’s sentiments are complicated by postmodern  . His aesthetic cunning is daring and slightly more abstract than John Ford’s and David Lean’s, which we take for granted as “realistic romanticism. ” (But understand: Ford and Lean were no less modern or technologically adventurous.) Davies, as in previous masterpieces The Long Day Closes, Distant Voices, Still Lives, and The Neon Bible, always inquires into the political underpinnings of narrative as well as personal and social relationships. That makes Sunset Song a challenge in today’s spiritually shrunken,   pop culture. This film’s Hardyesque passage of time moves in rhythmic measures, conforming to Davies’s own    affinity and his particular cynical existentialism. He is moved by the effects of culture and religion on people’s habits and interested in what time and circumstance bring out in folks: Chris’s fears, Ewan’s weakness, men’s bitterness, women’s compliance. All seemingly timeless, therefore classic. Plus, the film is visually astounding. Cinematographer Michael McDonough used 65mm lenses to “ensure depth, clarity, and emotional impact on the screen. ” It recalls the magnificent period scenes for Bertolucci’s Little Buddha. Sunset Song helps   audiences understand the foundations of contemporary humanity rural life and peonage in the early 20th century are perceived as exquisitely as in Jan Troell’s Everlasting Moments and Steven Spielberg’s War Horse. A sympathetic flashback to Ewan’s war experience (in Chris’s imagination or Davies’s?) gives proof of love and citizenship rooted in sorrow and history. Davies recreates the past so that it distills what the present  —   our certainties and delusions about our own time  —   obscures. More Movies Inside the Delightful Suicide of GawkerReagan Derangement Syndrome Is Alive and WellIn the   Baby Driver, Hollywood Goes Asperger’sWithout being a conventionally “conservative” filmmaker, Davies, in this   film, forces “radical,” “feminist” ideas to blend with our common concerns through a unifying appreciation of the difficulty and splendor of human experience. Note Chris’s intransigence about both her place of birth (“Nothing endures but the land”) and Scottish song and language (“She knew that they [English words] could never say anything worth saying at all”). It recalls the great Hollywood heroine Scarlett O’Hara, but here as depicted by a real artist. A great director must see himself in all his characters, and the events in Chris’s life convincingly continue the autobiographical aspects of Davies’s previous films about family and social heritage. That is to say, Sunset Song is true to Davies’s sensibility. He shows how the soul feels things, and we can see it.  —   Armond White, a film critic who writes about movies for National Review Online, received the American Book Awards’   Award.

"The Little Yellow Box Making Surgery Safer in Developing Countries. She learned the details of his injuries later: His spleen, the delicate   organ that sits just below the ribs and which acts as a blood filter as part of the immune system, was ruptured. “His tummy must have caught on something sharp inside the hole in the ground,” she says. But she didn’t need to be told how serious this was. As soon as she saw him, Gundegmaa, a midwife at the hospital, knew that this was a potentially fatal internal injury. Suddenly, the life she and her husband, Batsaikhan Batzorig, had created with such effort looked about to turn to dust. * * * Gundegmaa and Batsaikhan were both born in the small town of Ondorkhaan in Khentii Province —  one of the coldest spots on the Mongolian Steppe and 330 km of often deeply pitted road from the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. They had married soon after leaving school, and their first child was born 12 years ago. Back then it was a grim time in Mongolia, which was still in the grip of the desperate poverty that hit when 70 years of Soviet influence ended in the early 1990s. Russian forces had withdrawn from the country, taking with them the loans that had kept Mongolia afloat. It was fortunate that there were, and still are, hundreds of thousands of nomads in the country, around a quarter of the population. With their livestock —  25 million cows, horses, sheep, and goats —  at least people didn’t go hungry. But the couple worked hard to build a life together. First, Gundegmaa enrolled at the nursing school in Ulaanbaatar that had been established under the Soviet “Semashko”   system. Her husband remained at home with their baby —  and then three years later they swapped roles round, so that by 2010 both had jobs with the local hospital. He was a senior nurse she was a midwife. Their hometown was also on a roll, it being the capital of the province where the   Mongol warrior Chinggis Khan is thought to have been born. During the Soviet era, Mongolians were forbidden even to utter the name of the man they now regard as their national hero. But in 2013, the town known as Ondorkhaan was grandly renamed Chinggis City by an act of parliament. Gundegmaa and her family could visit a new museum featuring a replica of the great leader’s ger, the traditional tent, made of white felt, of this nomadic people. The town’s playgrounds, as throughout Mongolia, have figures of children (of both sexes) engaged in the “three manly sports” —  horse riding, wrestling, and archery —  that Chinggis Khan considered essential daily activities for his warriors. Just two weeks before Gunbileg’s accident, the family had moved into their first proper home, a flat in one of the new   blocks. * * * On duty the day of the accident was Mendbayar Lkhamsuren, an experienced surgeon with more than 4, 200 operations under his belt since he started working at the hospital in 2000 —  including, crucially, four previous cases involving a ruptured spleen. Through his training in safe surgery, Mendbayar has a genuine humility about the work he undertakes. “When I wake up in the morning, I reflect on the fact that I’m only human and that I’m just as capable of making mistakes as anyone else,” he tells me. Mendbayar and his surgical team worked fast to remove the spleen and stem the bleeding, and Gunbileg survived. Now aged 4, he needs to have all his jabs: without his spleen, he’s at increased risk of infectious diseases such as pneumonia and flu. But he is brimming with health and optimism, and has a passionate attachment to “my doctor Mende. ” When I meet him in the antenatal department of the hospital, keeping close to his mother, he lifts up his long white jacket, just like his hero’s, which covers a prominent scar on his tummy. A major contributory factor to his survival is a very bright idea that is changing emergency health care for people living in   and   countries. As Gunbileg was carried into the emergency room in May last year, a nurse placed on his finger a small   device attached by a wire to a   yellow monitor the size of a mobile phone. “Don’t be taken in by appearances,” the hospital’s anesthetist says as she sees me squinting to inspect it during my visit last October. “That device has been used every single day for the past four years. It’s saved hundreds of lives. And it’s still going strong. ” The device is a pulse oximeter. Invented by Japanese scientists in the early 1970s, this   device, which attaches via a clip to the top of the patient’s finger, accurately measures blood oxygen saturation —  the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is oxygenated —  and displays the figure on the monitor along with the patient’s pulse rate. The device’s audible beep reassures the team that all is well, with the pitch dropping if there’s a problem, allowing the anesthetist to “hear” any changes in   levels. In   countries today, pulse oximeters are part of the furniture in recovery rooms, ambulances, accident and emergency departments and many hospital wards —  wherever patients’ symptoms are serious and unpredictable. Its most important role, however, remains where it first began: in the operating theater. “Oximetry is a key component in the revolution in anesthesia care that has brought down the death rate from anesthesia by over 95 percent in a generation,” says Atul Gawande, the Boston surgeon, bestselling author, and New Yorker magazine writer. In the early 1970s, one in 10, 000 people per anesthetic administered died while under the gas in the U. S.: Thousands of people were dying every year. By the 1990s, when pulse oximetry was routinely used, that was closer to the current figure of less than one in 100, 000.   Yet the benefits of pulse oximetry have failed to spread throughout the world. More than 77, 000 operating theaters in   and   countries were carrying out surgery without a pulse oximeter according to a survey carried out in 2010, two decades after pulse oximetry became routine in affluent countries. Meanwhile, the rate of surgery in these countries has been increasing. The annual number of operations globally increased from 234 million in 2004 to an estimated 359 million in 2012 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) which reported that the 38 percent increase in surgical volume is occurring almost exclusively in   and    countries. And rightly so, says Gawande. “Of course this rate of surgery is needed,” he says. “More people die every year from conditions that can be effectively treated with surgery than from HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. And surgery is essential for reducing maternal mortality, and deaths from road traffic accidents. ” The problem is that while the rate of surgery is increasing, so is the rate of those damaged by surgery. Research published in the Lancet in 2009 shows that more than 7 million people are left dead or disabled from complications due to unsafe surgery every year —  with the risk of complications and deaths from essential operations up to 1, 000 times higher in   settings.   All but the newest recruits to the Mongolian anesthesia community understand the background to these statistics. Unurzaya Lkhagvajav, a former president of the Mongolian Society of Anesthesiologists, qualified as an anesthetist in 1980 and reckons she has provided anesthesia for 30, 000 operations. The equipment she had available to keep a patient safe during most of these operations was a stethoscope, a watch with a second hand, and a pencil. “The only way to know if a patient’s blood was oxygenated was to take the patient’s pulse throughout the operation and check the color of the fingernails: If they were pink, the patient was in good health,” she recalls. “It was exhausting work. And once the operation was over, the need to monitor blood oxygen levels is just as important. The only way to check for   complications was to sit with the patient all night. And of course that wasn’t always possible, not when you had a long shift the next day. ” In 2008 Gawande, at the request of the WHO, led a group of expert nurses, anesthetists, and surgeons to create the Surgical Safety Checklist. Essentially, it is a communications framework designed to eliminate human error in the operating theatre in the same way as the aviation industry has made flying safe for passengers. But alongside behavioral change to ensure effective teamwork and, for instance, that appropriate bloods and equipment are easily accessible and antibiotics administered, there’s a single piece of kit, the pulse oximeter, that is mandated by the checklist. Without it, the WHO decided, surgery is simply unsafe. In 2011, with the support of prominent medical institutions, Gawande helped to found the charity Lifebox to make safe surgery a reality throughout the world. “We started by doing work that reduced the cost of robust,   pulse oximeters for   countries by over 80 percent to just $250,” he explains. The Lifebox oximeter can withstand extreme heat and cold and the battery is functional for at least 12 hours. Crucially, it is also tough, and can be dropped from table height without breaking. “It’s not going to break down soon after arrival, a serious problem with medical equipment in   countries,” says Gawande. Studies suggest that the WHO checklist, when used correctly with pulse oximetry, reduces complications and mortality by 30 percent. By providing pulse oximeters in   settings, Lifebox estimates that it has contributed to making surgery safer for 10 million patients. Through donations, Lifebox has distributed nearly 15, 000 oximeters to hospitals in settings where even the cheapest and most fragile oximeter is unaffordable. But it’s much more than this, Gawande says. “If all we were doing was parachuting in a bunch of pulse oximeters, we wouldn’t have such a tremendous impact. ” Instead, through a volunteer network of anesthetists from   countries, Lifebox has supplied thousands of anesthesia providers in   countries with safety skills training. “Once you introduce the device and safety training into the riskiest part of the hospital system, you begin to build confidence that there are professional values at work aimed at generating better, safer care,” Gawande explains. “It gives clinicians confidence that they can take on more difficult cases. And people begin to believe that turning to hospitals when you are in desperate trouble is safe, that these are places you want to go. ” * * * Ganbold Lundeg was surprised when he first read the Bible —  and not pleasantly. It was 1993, a low point in Mongolian history, when   medicine, like the country itself, was floundering. Ganbold, a lecturer in anesthesia at the Health Sciences University of Mongolia, wasn’t alone in wondering whether the Bible, much promoted by a visiting surgeon and missionary from Arkansas, USA, Albert “Buck” H. Rusher, might offer an answer. So he decided to learn English in order to read it. The American’s Bible classes were a hit with the Mongolian medical community. “Some doctors were converted to Christianity without reading the Bible,” recalls Ganbold. “I wanted to read it first. ” He enrolled at an international school, attending the one   course in the whole of Mongolia at the time. “I’d heard so much about the Bible,” he recalls. But the text, particularly the Old Testament, was unimpressive, “just like the fairy stories we heard as children. ” Yet he has never regarded as wasted the time he devoted to reading how Moses led his people through the Red Sea. Learning English gave him access to   medical journals, to which he was able to subscribe with the support of the missionary. “Even in the 1990s, these journals were regarded as subversive —  they always arrived opened. I once had a visit from a member of the KGB who wanted to know why I was receiving them. ” Most importantly, he says, speaking English enabled him to make a personal connection that has undoubtedly helped to save hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives. In 1999, a   anesthesiologist, David Pescod, arrived in Ulaanbaatar to attend a medical conference. On that first visit, Pescod survived on mutton fat and vodka and spent two weeks listening to lectures in Mongolian interspersed with electricity cuts, all in  —  20ºC temperatures. The only other fluent English speaker present was Ganbold, who asked Pescod to return to deliver a lecture the following year. Pescod kept going back, forging links there together with a group of Australian colleagues, and what he learned about anesthetic practices in Mongolia surprised him. Mongolian surgical training and practice, he realised, were based on outdated, frankly dangerous    Russian texts, with patients being given inappropriate anesthetic drugs and at insufficient doses. Pescod settled down to write a series of anesthesia textbooks designed specifically for Mongolian hospitals. In 2004, Ganbold’s department, supported by the Australian team, started to implement the WHO’s Emergency and Essential Surgical Care program, aimed at strengthening surgical services outside the capital city. “Many people think that surgery is something very special that cannot be delivered in a developing country or in a rural area,” he says. “But when we build up safe conditions, educate people, and train them appropriately, then doctors and nurses can deliver safe surgery in a very small hospital anywhere in Mongolia. ” The recent safe surgery developments have built on this innovation. In 2011, the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist was made mandatory by the Mongolian health department. By 2012, funding from Australian and New Zealand anesthetists had paid for 116 Lifebox pulse oximeters: 64 in Ulaanbaatar, three in Chinggis City and the others distributed throughout the country. The oximeters themselves have been physically delivered by Lifebox, which also provides teaching materials for a   course on pulse oximetry that is now incorporated into a week of training on safe anesthesia that Pescod and his team continue to provide each year in Ulaanbaatar and throughout Mongolia. Lifebox pulse oximeters have been handed out to surgical teams at   hospitals, the large district hospitals such as the one in Chinggis City, as well as at smaller soum (township) hospitals, enabling local staff to respond to emergencies. At one level, it means that around 200 people a year with acute appendicitis are treated in Khentii Province instead of having to travel to Ulaanbaatar —  the only location able to carry out appendectomies until four years ago. At the other extreme, emergency patients like Gunbileg receive urgent   surgery. In January 2014, Ganbold became one of 25 clinical experts advising the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery —  “the proudest achievement in my professional career” —  with its aspiration to make safe surgery and anesthesia a human right available to all. Mongolia is now cited by the Lancet Commission as a potential model in promoting safe surgery and anesthesia for other   countries such as Myanmar and Laos, and even for India and China. Ganbold’s great ambition is to open 20 hospitals with functioning operating theatres by 2020, by building up services in strategically located provincial clinics. If that means going cap in hand to wealthy countries and organizations, that’s what he does. In Ulaanbaatar, we visit the UK ambassador to Mongolia, and Ganbold explains to her how the UK government could provide assistance with the minimum of funding. The UK firm Diamedica has pioneered the production of basic anesthesia machines that can be used virtually anywhere without electricity or even medical gases. Ganbold urges the ambassador to consider funding such machines for hospitals in remote Mongolia. She agrees to consider the idea. It’s this persistence in seeking out and achieving the best that keeps Pescod coming back to Mongolia, he says. “Unlike other countries where I have lectured, eventually everything we bring to Mongolian anesthetists has been engaged and usually improved,” he tells me. Bilguun Unurbileg, a senior lecturer in anesthesiology at the Health Sciences University of Mongolia and Ganbold’s number two, says that’s down to their nomadic ancestry. “Mongolians are   to reach out for new ideas. That’s the result of centuries of living in the middle of nowhere, entirely reliant on yourself to care for your family. It’s how we survive. ” * * * Two thousand miles south of Ulaanbaatar, Assam in   India has twice the country’s already high average maternal mortality rate: There are around 300 deaths per 100, 000 pregnancies in Assam, compared with 174 in India as a whole and just nine in the UK.   of these deaths occur among the   female workforce employed in Assam’s tea gardens, where the high number of perinatal emergencies is the result of the harsh conditions of the working day. Even when women and their babies do get successful surgery in the nearest properly equipped hospital,   care remains hazardous, partly because of the lack of pulse oximetry in recovery wards. “Health care for mothers working in tea gardens is pathetic,” says Surajit Giri, a consultant anesthetist and critical care physician based at Demow Community Health Centre near Sivasagar, northern Assam. He is employed by the Indian government as part of its recently established National Rural Health Mission. But he’s well aware of the deficiencies of the service. Demow is the only clinic providing care for seven tea gardens —  and has only one operating theatre, with basic obstetric intensive care facilities. Last October, Giri helped to organize (and attended) a Train the Trainers workshop in Dibrugarh, organized by Lifebox, focusing on the benefits of pulse oximetry in   care —  an area local practitioners had identified as being one where they most needed support. UK consultant anesthetist Neeraj Bhardwaj talked 68 local anesthetists through a   Safer Anesthesia workshop. And at the end of the day, each practitioner was able to go back to work with their own new Lifebox pulse oximeter. The day after receiving the Lifebox oximeter, Giri made it mandatory for nurses at the health centre to monitor oxygen saturation levels in newborn babies, using the neonatal probe that comes with the adult oximeter for an extra $25. Already, he says, health care is safer. “That day, a baby was delivered that was shown by the probe to have just 58 percent oxygen saturation. The nurse immediately shouted for my help to resuscitate the baby, which I rushed to do —  and it soon started crying healthily, maintaining oxygen concentration without assistance. Without the oximeter, that would not have happened. If five minutes had gone by before we took action, the baby would probably have survived, but with a disabling brain injury. ” The Dibrugarh course is the first event of a   initiative funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation that will eventually hand out 675 Lifebox pulse oximeters, with appropriate training, initially in three regions of India: Bihar, Odisha and Assam. It’s the start of a journey to transform surgery in a country where currently 7, 000 out of 155, 000 operating theatres lack pulse oximetry. “Of course Lifebox pulse oximeters increase the safety of patients,” says Giri. “But they also increase the security and confidence of anesthetists to join rural services, which they haven’t done before because of lack of technology and poor infrastructure. ” * * * One woman was 38 weeks pregnant when, lifting a heavy load while setting up camp in her   ger, she felt a sudden sharp pain in her abdomen. It was September 2015 and she knew straight away that her baby was at risk. The nomad family’s ger was pitched in Khovd Province in western Mongolia. It’s a natural paradise: a vast area of   peaks, rocky deserts, and salt lakes that is an adventure playground for tourists in the summer and a favored location for Mongolia’s nomads to graze their herds of sheep, goats, and yaks. The woman used her mobile phone to summon the rural soum doctor from a small surgery a     drive away. He examined her, and confirmed that she had suffered a placental abruption, the pressure from the load she was carrying almost certainly causing a swathe of blood vessels that feed the fetus to detach from the wall of the uterus. “The rural doctor reported that the fetus was distressed and that it was out of the question for the mother to travel to us,” recalls Nansalmaa, an obstetrician based in the main hospital in the city of Khovd. So the obstetric team, Nansalmaa, an anesthetist and a neonatologist went to the woman’s ger, together with the basic equipment needed to carry out an emergency caesarean section, including an oxygen concentrator and suction machine, an operating lamp, a Honda electricity generator and, perhaps most importantly, a pulse oximeter. Within hours of an incident that until recently would have consigned the woman and her baby to becoming yet another obstetric fatality, both mother and baby survived thanks to safe spinal anesthesia followed by a caesarean section. Ger surgery is rare. But when necessary, it happens without fuss. For nomadic patients, that instils confidence: not just in the   system, but also in their chosen traditional lifestyle. That’s what I discover when I call on Tumurdavaa Gursed in the ger that was the location for her emergency surgery eight years ago, when she was close to death due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She too was unable to travel, and would have died had the emergency surgical team not already been in operation and ready to travel through the night to carry out the emergency operation —  albeit without a pulse oximeter —  at first dawn. I sit on the low bench used for the operation, reflecting on the commitment of the team back then —  carrying out a   operation in a roasting hot ger, the anesthetist bent almost double throughout to monitor his patient. Tumurdavaa, serving boiled horse with blood pudding and potatoes along with fresh cream and biscuits, is silent as we eat. I take it for shyness at first, but then realise it’s simply a lack of interest in small talk. When I ask her about her brush with death, she talks at length, eloquent in paying tribute not only to the medical team but also to the impact of the policy of safe surgery on nomadic life. “I’m so joyful and reassured,” she tells me, “that I can continue living blissfully beside my animals. ” This article appears courtesy of Mosaic.

"Einstein’s Gravitational Waves Detected In Scientific Milestone. Scientists said on Thursday they have for the first time detected gravitational waves, ripples in space and time hypothesized by physicist Albert Einstein a century ago, in a landmark discovery that opens a new window for studying the cosmos. [The researchers said they detected gravitational waves coming from two black holes  —   extraordinarily dense objects whose existence also was foreseen by Einstein  —   that orbited one another, spiraled inward and smashed together. They said the waves were the product of a collision between two black holes 30 times as massive as the Sun, located 1. 3 billion light years from Earth.  The scientific milestone, announced at a news conference in Washington, was achieved using a pair of giant laser detectors in the United States, located in Louisiana and Washington state, capping a long quest to confirm the existence of these waves. The announcement was made in Washington by scientists from the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Like light, gravity travels in waves, but instead of radiation, it is space itself that is rippling. Detecting the gravitational waves required measuring 2.  (4 km) laser beams to a precision 10, 000 times smaller than a proton. The two laser instruments, which work in unison, are known as the Laser Interferometer   Observatory (LIGO). They are able to detect remarkably small vibrations from passing gravitational waves. After detecting the gravitational wave signal, the scientists said they converted it into audio waves and were able to listen to the sounds of the two black holes merging. “We’re actually hearing them go thump in the night,” MIT physicist Matthew Evans said. “We’re getting a signal which arrives at Earth, and we can put it on a speaker, and we can hear these black holes go, ‘Whoop.’ There’s a very visceral connection to this observation. ” The scientists said they first detected the gravitational waves last Sept. 14. “We are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy,” MIT astrophysicist Nergis Mavalvala said in an interview. “We have turned on a new sense. We have been able to see and now we will be able to hear as well. ” The LIGO work is funded by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U. S. government. Einstein in 1916 proposed the existence of gravitational waves as an outgrowth of his   general theory of relativity, which depicted gravity as a distortion of space and time triggered by the presence of matter. But until now scientists had found only indirect evidence of their existence. OPEN THE DOOR, Scientists said gravitational waves open a door for a new way to observe the universe and gain knowledge about enigmatic objects like black holes and neutron stars. By studying gravitational waves they also hope to gain insight into the nature of the very early universe, which has remained mysterious. Everything we know about the cosmos stems from electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, visible light, infrared light,   and gamma rays. But because such waves encounter interference as they travel across the universe, they can tell only part of the story. Gravitational waves experience no such barriers, meaning they can offer a wealth of additional information. Black holes, for example, do not emit light, radio waves and the like, but can be studied via gravitational waves. Scientists sounded positively giddy over the discovery. “It is really a truly, truly exciting event,” said Abhay Ashtekar, director of Penn State University’s Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos. “It opens a brand new window on the universe. ” “The LIGO announcement describes one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the past 50 years,” Cornell University physicist Saul Teukolsky added. Ashtekar said heavy celestial objects bend space and time but because of the relative weakness of the gravitational force the effect is miniscule except from massive and dense bodies like black holes and neutron stars. He said that when these objects collide, they send out ripples in the curvature of space and time that propagate as gravitational waves. The detection of gravitational waves already has provided unique insight into black holes, with the scientists saying it has demonstrated that there are plenty of black holes in the range of tens of solar masses, resolving the long debated issue of the existence of black holes of that size. A black hole, a region of space so packed with matter that not even photons of light can escape the force of gravity, was detected for the first time in 1971. Scientists have known the existence of small black holes and   supermassive black holes are millions or billions of times as massive as the sun, but had debated the existence of black holes of intermediate size. Neutron stars are small, about the size of a city, but are extremely heavy, the compact remains of a larger star that died in a supernova explosion.

"Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination, AP reports.     Hillary Clinton has enough delegates to become the first woman to top the presidential ticket of a major U. S. political party on, according to an Associated Press count released Monday. The presumptive victory came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first White House campaign to Barack Obama. Back then, she famously noted her inability to ”shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling.” Clinton, the former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady, reached the 2, 383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee on Monday with a weekend victory in Puerto Rico and a burst of   support from superdelegates, AP said. Those are party officials and officeholders, many of them eager to wrap up the primary amid preference polls showing her in a tightening race with presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. Clinton has 1, 812 pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. The AP surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months, and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted. While superdelegates will not formally cast their votes for Clinton until the party’s July convention in Philadelphia, all those counted in her tally have unequivocally told the AP they will do so. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → ”This is an important milestone, but there are six states that are voting Tuesday, with millions of people heading to the polls, and Hillary Clinton is working to earn every vote,” said Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook in a statement obtained by Fox News. ”We look forward to Tuesday night, when Hillary Clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates.” Campaigning this time as the loyal successor to Obama, Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with    even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009. Sanders said this past weekend he plans to fight on until the convention, promising to make the case to superdelegates that he is better positioned to beat Trump in November. Superdelegates can change their minds. But since the start of the AP’s survey in late 2015, no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders. “It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgement, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,” Sanders’ campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said Monday.  “Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25and who can change their minds between now and then. They include more than 400 superdelegates who endorsed Secretary Clinton 10 months before the first caucuses and primaries and long before any other candidate was in the race. “Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump. ” Clinton outpaced Sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in May. Following the results in Puerto Rico, it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2, 383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates, according to the AP. Clinton leads Sanders by more than 3 million cast votes, by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates. She also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories. Echoing the sentiments of California Gov. Jerry Brown, who overcame a   rivalry with the Clinton family to endorse her last week, many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat Trump in November. ”It’s time to stand behind our presumptive candidate,” said Michael Brown, one of two superdelegates from the District of Columbia who came forward in the past week to back Clinton before the city’s June 14 primary. ”We shouldn’t be acting like we are undecided when the people of America have spoken.” Though she marched into her second presidential primary campaign as an overwhelming favorite, Clinton could not shake Sanders until its final days. He campaigned aggressively in California ahead of the state’s Tuesday election, unwilling to exit a race Clinton stood on the cusp of winning. Beyond winning over millions of Sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the   democratic socialist, Clinton faces challenges as she turns toward November, including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her New York home while serving as secretary of state. Her deep unpopularity among Republicans has pushed many leery of Trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign. ”This to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive, liberal term, which is what a Clinton presidency would do,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told the AP last week after he finally endorsed Trump, weeks after the New Yorker clinched the GOP nomination. Yet Clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone, leaving Sanders behind and focusing on lacerating Trump. She said electing the billionaire businessman, who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks, would be a ”historic mistake.” ”He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,” Clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness, previewing a brutal   general election campaign to come. Even without the nomination, Sanders can claim ideological victory. His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade, Wall Street and campaign finance reform. But she prevailed, in part, by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama. She won overwhelming support from women and minorities, catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse,   states such as New York and Texas. When Clinton launched her campaign last April, she did so largely unopposed, having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party’s organizational and fundraising infrastructure. Vice President Joe Biden, seen as her most threatening rival, opted not to run in October. Of the four opponents who did take her on, Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge. He caught fire among young voters and independents, his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire. His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring. But Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates, hiring help from Obama’s old team before launching her campaign. They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates. Her victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation. Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead, which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast. She now moves on to face Trump, whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected. The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton, debuting a nickname  —   ”Crooked Hillary”  —   and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup. After a long primary campaign, Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge. ”We’re judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, not our ethnicity, not our religion,” she said Saturday in Oxnard, California. ”So it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds. And I believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the United States.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.   ",1.0
"Europe’s justice ministers unsure on whether to push for decrypt law – TechCrunch. European justice and home affairs ministers are putting their heads together to try to decide on a collective response to Internet companies’ use of strong encryption. And, ultimately, whether to push for legislation requiring backdoors in end-to-end encryption to afford the region’s law enforcement agencies access to user data on-demand. Last summer home affairs ministers from France and Germany called for a law to enable courts to demand Internet companies decrypt data on request. Their call was repeated earlier this week by UK Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, who said intelligence services must be able to access readable data from apps such as end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp, asserting: “There should be no place for terrorists to hide.” As is typically the case when politicians denounce technology companies’ use of encryption, Rudd was speaking in the wake of a terror attack. France and Germany have also suffered a series of terror attacks in recent years, upping the ante for ministers to be seen to be taking action to defuse more terrorist plots. Encryption technology has been the scapegoat of choice for Western politicians responding to terrorist attacks for multiple years now, despite governments also operating vast, dragnet digital surveillance programs. And having access to ever more traceries of metadata to link possible suspects to potential plots. (Arguably it’s the volume of data that security agencies are now systematically collecting that’s causing them problems in prioritizing which suspects to watch closely — hence calls by Rudd et al for access to content too.) Yesterday EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova also touched on the topic of encrypted apps, speaking during a press conference held following a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels. A Euractiv report of her comments suggests the EC has already made up its mind to put forward measures this summer — aimed at forcing what she described as a “swift, reliable response” from encrypted apps when asked to hand over decrypted data. Jourova also reportedly said she’s holding “very intensive” talks with big Internet companies about giving police access to encrypted data. However a Commission spokeswoman told TechCrunch that no decisions have been made about how to approach encryption at this stage, adding that discussions are not yet “very advanced”. On encryption the discussions are still ongoing. And for now there’s no legislative plan. “On encryption the discussions are still ongoing,” the spokeswoman told us. “And for now there’s no legislative plan.” She could not confirm whether WhatsApp is one of the companies Jourova is holding talks with. The Facebook-owned messaging giant has had its service blocked by courts in Brazil on several occasions, after the company was penalized for not providing decrypted chat logs pertaining to criminal investigations (the company has maintained it cannot provide the data to police as it does not have access to the data). Whether similar legal actions might be brought against it and other encrypted apps in Europe in future remains to be seen. We’ve reached out to WhatsApp for comment on the EC discussions and will update this story with any response. The Commission spokeswoman said a separate issue under discussion by the Council — so-called e-evidence; aka the process for prosecutors to request digital evidence across legal jurisdictions (such as a prosecutor in an EU country seeking to obtain data held on a server in California, for example) — is at a more advanced stage, and confirmed there will be legislative options and other measures proposed on that this June. But the question of whether EU lawmakers intend to push to require Internet companies such as WhatsApp to effectively backdoor their end-to-end encryption remains an open-ended one. Asked for more details of the ongoing talks between EU ministers on encryption, the spokeswoman confirmed there is agreement between them that the technology presents a challenge for law enforcement — though, again, she stressed there is no clarity on what measures they might push for in future. “Yesterday all the ministers agreed that this is an issue and that criminal justice in cyberspace is being challenged by this, but for now no one really came up with any concrete solution,” she said. “There’s a working group that’s organized by the Commission, bringing experts from all over Europe and from different [sectors], technology but also justice, to discuss it together. “We’re gathering evidence and information on this, and this will be discussed again in June.” The spokeswoman also noted there are further complications for having an EU-wide response on this issue, given Member States set their own laws where national security issues are concerned. Indeed, the UK has already legislated to be able to demand decryption on request and block use of e2e encryption in the Investigatory Powers Act, which passed into UK law last year — although some elements of the legislation have yet to be implemented, owing to a separate EU legal ruling regarding “generate and indiscriminate” data retention, which the law appears to breach. “Everyone agrees that if there is a crime, if the data is encrypted, it has to be handed in to the authorities in a readable way. But the issue is very, very complex in the sense that matters of national security are also Member State competence so there’s no competence at the EU level. So that’s also a point that’s complicating the discussions here,” the spokeswoman told us. “Also we have to find the right balance,” she added. “For which reasons would you access this data? And so there is still a lot of open questions. If someone wants to access it for bad reasons… how do you put safeguards for that? So it’s really all those open questions are out there.” The EU’s anti-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, previously discussed this notion of balance, telling Euractiv: “We need a very strong internet — we don’t want to create vulnerabilities”, but also emphasizing that security services, police, and law enforcement agencies must be able to “get access to the content, which is important for security reasons”. “The question is, can you open a backdoor for Europol only, or would that at the same time create a vulnerability and open a backdoor for the Russian mafia or third party state spies? This is part of the discussion but we are not there yet. There is internal work — it’s a tricky issue,” de Kerchove added. Elsewhere, the Commissions’ technology policy chief recently tweeted a confirmation he’s still against the idea of mandating backdoors and weakening encryption — although in his earlier comments, from November he also conceded the issue is not so black and white where the interests of law enforcement are concerned. Weakening encryption is not an option, I have not changed my position: https://t.co/XwKv6YcFVf https://t.co/s1d8b6TAp2 — Andrus Ansip (@Ansip_EU) March 10, 2017 The EC spokeswoman confirmed to us today that there is no timeframe at this point for when the Justice & Home Affairs working group will have reached a decision on how to proceed. Which means this is an opportune moment for the technology and security industry to get in touch with EU politicians to reiterate the point that weakening security for all Internet users is not a sensible nor proportionate response to national security concerns. The region has also recently legislated to beef up local data protection laws. So any push to perforate commercial security systems and put millions of app users’ data at risk of hacking would be a hugely contrarian move vs the incoming General Data Protection Regulation which will hike potential fines for data breaches to up to 4 per cent of a company’s global turnover.",0.0
"What's next for cancer immunotherapies. Cancer immunotherapies that trigger a person's own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells have logged some success in certain patients and with certain types of cancers. ""But overall that is a minority of cancer patients,"" says Antoni Ribas from the University of California, Los Angeles. Now, researchers are looking to leverage their understanding of what's working and what's not in patients receiving this class of drugs. (Science published a special section about cancer immunotherapy Thursday.) The challenge: These are new avenues for research but they also spur serious concerns that must be addressed: unwanted and sometimes deadly side effects, unexplained lack of response by some cancers, and questions arising from combining multiple therapies and finding the optimal timing — which can make or break treatment. How it works: Cancer metastasizes when it successfully evades or tricks a person's immune system into allowing it to spread. Two of the main types of immunotherapies are ""checkpoint inhibitors"" that work by taking the brakes off the immune system so it can recognize and attack cancer cells, and CAR-T cell therapy that works by engineering a patient's immune cells to attack cancer. 1. Checkpoint inhibitors more frequently work in cancer cells that are genetically different from normal cells as the result of genetic mutations from carcinogens (think: smoking or sun exposure) or from a virus, explains Ribas. ""That leaves all of the other cancers and what to do with them."" Washington University School of Medicine's Russell Pachynski says the concern with these is “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity — where the checkpoint inhibitors that are supposed to stimulate and activate T cells are doing this in the non-tumor cells, leading to ""unwanted activation of the immune system, resulting in potentially life-threatening complications like immune-mediated colitis or auto-immune hepatitis."" One of the current challenges in evaluating these therapies is that there are currently more than 1100 trials testing combinations of the drugs, raising questions about whether the studies are motivated by business more so than science, Jocelyn Kaiser reports for Science. But Ribas says, ""The system is working. We're making progress...There are practicalities [behind these trials] but companies made [those drugs] because there is science that supports those drugs. It’s not trial and error."" 2. CAR-T cell therapy is when a patient's T-cells are removed, manipulated and reinserted inside the body to fight the cancer.  ""That field will see the biggest growth in the future,"" predicts Ribas. “With checkpoint inhibitors, we'll get to the point where we’ve turned off everything we can and will have to engineer the immune system.” Pachynski says that so far CAR-T therapy works best against cancers circulating through the blood such as leukemia and lymphoma. There's been limited research and success so far in ""solid tumors"" such as those in pancreatic and prostate cancers. He says that's because: It can be more difficult to identify a common tumor target in solid tumors than liquid.  CAR-T cells have to be trafficked to the tumor. ""In leukemia, the tumor is in the blood and thus intravenous administration of CAR-Ts gives immediate access to tumors, while solid tumors present additional barriers.""  The activity of CAR-T cells has to be controlled so they only target tumor cells. Researching personalized treatment vaccines have long been a pipedream but the idea has been slow in advancing via a multitude of small clinical trials. Research has recently focused on RNA-based vaccines that target a patient's tumor-specific mutations and alterations to trigger T-cell response. There are still the issues of expense, long lead-time to create the vaccines, and determining the best method of selecting the specific tumor to target. Testing other checkpoint inhibitors:  Currently available therapies focus on inhibiting the PD-1 receptor on T-cells that hampers the last step in the process of attacking cancer cells, or CTLA-4, which regulates the proliferation of T-cells earlier in the immune response. Researchers are looking at whether using other checkpoint inhibitors like LAG-3 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug can increase their success. Activating the immune system: Another approach being evaluated is whether the immune system can be readied to attack by injecting a virus, or virus-mimicking drug, that attacks cancer cells before giving someone a checkpoint inhibitor, Ribas says. Researchers are also attempting to spark the immune response by administering small proteins called cytokines that regulate the immune system.  Blocking adenosine:  When cancer cells replicate fast, they can start dying because they outgrow their blood supply. In the process, a molecule called adenosine can be released which then inhibits the function of T-cells being called on to attack cancer cells. A new class of agents is being tested in the clinic to see whether that process, too, can be blocked.  Inhibiting monocytes and regulatory T-cells: Tumors attract monocytes — non-specific cells that are important for healing wounds — as well as a type of T-cell called regulatory T cells that actually turn off other T-cells. Research is aimed at trying to inhibit these immune suppressive cells. Exploring the microbiome: Scientists are trying to understand the relationship between bacteria in the gut and how cancer therapies work. Pachynski says research is "" yielding some exciting data. The microbiome no doubt impacts immune responses, but the key will be given the huge diversity of bacteria, which ones are key players in favorably modulating the responses for patients and how do we actualize that in patients.""

"Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector.  Intel Corp ( ) agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye ( ) for $15. 3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U. S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp ( ) and Qualcomm Inc ( ) to develop driverless systems for global automakers.  The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel   valuations of    . The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully   cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen   companies developing different components for   systems, from robotics to sensors.  Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips,   networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. ”This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. ”Mobileye’s technology is very critical. .. The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move ”very far outside its core business franchise.”  The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s   deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the ”very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP.  The $63.   cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its   high closing price of $64. 14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28. 2 percent to close at $60. 62, while Intel’s shares were down 2. 1 percent.  The market for   technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo ( ) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc ( ). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC ( ) which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4. 0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING ’EYES’ AND ’BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4. 2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7. 7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the ”eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for   systems   the building blocks for   cars   to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: ”If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player. .. The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public   last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for   and   systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173. 3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR   Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW ( ) on a project to put a fleet of around 40   test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its   of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a   platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The   deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

"White House Makes Full-Court Press For Garland As Supreme Court Nominee. President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court is already making telephone calls to senators, hoping to win a confirmation hearing. Merrick Garland will start making   visits to the Capitol on Thursday. That’s the normal order of business for a   nominee. But with many Senate Republicans insisting they won’t consider Garland’s nomination, the White House is also taking its case to the American public. The PR campaign for Garland includes a dedicated Twitter handle (@scotusnom) a   biographical video and a litany of details designed to humanize the   appellate judge. Not only did Garland graduate with honors from Harvard, the White House noted, he sold his comic book collection to help pay the tuition. ”I’d like to take a minute to introduce Merrick to the American people,” the president said in the Rose Garden. He highlighted Garland’s record as a prosecutor who helped bring Oklahoma City bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols to justice, and a jurist who’s won praise from conservatives including John Roberts and Sen. Orrin Hatch,  . The   press began hours earlier with a mass email from Obama headlined, ”I’ve made my decision.” ”In putting forward a nominee,” the president wrote, ”I’m doing my job. I hope that our [s]enators will do their jobs, and move quickly to consider my nominee. That is what the Constitution dictates, and that’s what the American people expect and deserve from their leaders.” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has a different view. He announced just hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died that the potentially   seat on the Supreme Court should remain vacant until a new president is in office. ”Give the people a voice in filling this vacancy,” McConnell said again Wednesday on the Senate floor. The National Republican Senate Committee chimed in, calling Garland ”an ideologue who would loyally stand with the court’s liberal wing and bolster the radical Obama agenda.” The administration hopes to undermine that argument by circulating past testimonials in support of Garland from Republicans like Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. (Iowa’s Chuck Grassley has a key role to play in deciding whether to grant Garland a hearing as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.) When Garland was named to the appeals court in 1997, 30 Republicans voted for his confirmation, including seven who still serve in the Senate. The White House PR campaign is designed to paint a picture of a nominee who’s so reasonable and centrist that Senate Republicans look unreasonable for not giving him a hearing. ”We will have to see if Republicans can sustain this posture,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. ”We continue to believe there will be ample number of Republicans who believe the Constitution comes before their party’s political leadership.” Sen. Susan Collins,   told NPR’s All Things Considered she believes the Senate should at least consider Garland’s nomination. ”The Constitution is very clear,” Collins said. ”The president has every right to make this nomination and then the Senate can either consent or withhold its consent. The only way that we can do that is by thoroughly vetting the nominee. And that means having personal meetings which I have scheduled to come up in about three weeks . .. and, to hold a public hearing.” The White House hopes to sway other Republican senators, especially those in swing states who are up for   in November.",-0.5
"Industry to Trump: Don't mess with value-based health care. A financially and politically powerful group of 121 hospital systems, health insurers, drug companies, physician groups and lobbying firms are asking President Trump not to undermine the movement toward a system that rewards safer and less expensive care. Obamacare has pushed for the faster adoption of so-called value-based care, where hospitals, doctors, drug makers and others are paid for the best health care outcomes instead of the number of services or products they provide. This concept was further enshrined in the bipartisan MACRA law that was passed last year, although many have argued that law is overly complex. The letter, sent Wednesday, calls on the Trump administration to back ideas the industry has invested in, like accountable care organizations. Trump's Health and Human Services nominee, Tom Price, isn't a huge fan of MACRA or some of the value-based care projects, like bundled payments. Some of the signees: The American Hospital Association and many of its health system members like the Cleveland Clinic, Aetna, Anthem, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Some of the other groups and companies that signed the letter, like Evolent Health and Athenahealth, also have a big financial stake in the cause because they provide technology and consulting for value-based care.",0.0
"Castro in Africa. For nearly three decades, Fidel Castro devoted vast amounts of Cuba’s limited resources to the project of exporting his revolution to Africa, even as it stuttered at home. As leader of Cuba, Castro advocated a radical departure from the prevailing   liberal internationalism, premised more on the ideas of Frantz Fanon than those of Adam Smith. Decolonization seemed to offer a prime laboratory for that vision. Cuba volunteered doctors, nurses, military advisers, and troops to support what Castro and Che Guevara saw as progressive regimes —  “sister countr[ies],” in Havana’s terminology —  in Algeria, Eastern   (today’s Democratic Republic of Congo)     and, later, Ethiopia. How Did Fidel Castro Hold On to Cuba for So Long? In the days since his death, and in parallel with obituaries detailing his record of violence and repression at home, Castro has been widely celebrated for his role in southern Africa in particular, a region where he supported Angolan revolutionaries pitted against the U. S.  apartheid regime of South Africa. And yet Cuba’s role on the continent also illuminates some of the contradictions of advancing an   agenda, premised on social and racial justice, in part through the execution of proxy wars abroad. Beginning in the 1960s, Castro and Guevara developed a relationship with Angola’s People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) then locked in an   struggle against Portuguese rule. When Portugal’s armed forces staged a mutiny in 1975, a power vacuum ensued. The MPLA was   to take over, but the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had ideas of their own, forming a fragile alliance. Both would have been utterly uncompetitive, were it not for their foreign backers: Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaïre (the newly renamed  ) South Africa’s apartheid government, and the United States. It was an alliance of rare disrepute. In the second half of 1975, tensions between the three Angolan movements became skirmishes, before erupting into open warfare. A minor conflict in a distant African country, ruled for 500 years by a country back in Europe, suddenly came to be seen as a test of wills for different political blocs and their visions for the world’s future. Each side ratcheted up their contributions in response to the other. Cuba’s contribution soon increased from doctors and technicians to military advisors, infantry, and officers. On the other side of the conflict, South Africa and the United States each saw the MPLA’s rise as a potential triumph for global communism. In August 1975, President Gerald Ford told Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, “I have decided on Angola.   …     [I]f we do nothing, we will lose Southern Africa. ” Both the United States and South Africa launched separate covert programs to funnel aid and weapons to the FNLA and UNITA, only to find that their   forces needed much more. Many of the fighters lacked boots and basic military gear. Few had handled sophisticated firearms before, let alone mortars or mines. Though some units had waged guerrilla campaigns against the Portuguese, none had experience in the conventional warfare needed to seize land from the MPLA. The allies realized that a support role would not be enough they would have to take the lead, deploying regular troops under their own command. In the wake of the Vietnam War, the U. S. Congress and American public opinion were extremely hostile to another military commitment abroad in a place even more unknown to them than southeast Asia. But elements in the apartheid regime were deeply concerned that an MPLA government in Angola might become a springboard for the African National Congress and for the South West Africa People’s Organization, which contested South Africa’s control over   Africa (what today is Namibia) through an expired League of Nations mandate. With the white South Africans volunteering a full military effort, the Ford administration decided to let them do America’s dirty work. The South Africans could, and should, have secured an explicit quid pro quo for offering to be America’s shock troops, but failed to do so. Due to the diplomatic toxicity of South Africa’s apartheid policies, the operation was conducted in absolute secrecy. Perhaps only a few leaders in Pretoria understood its full extent. Few American officials knew what was going on either, and those that did lied about it. When the operation was exposed in December 1975, President Ford instructed his African embassies to tell their host governments, “The U. S. in no way sought or encouraged the South Africans to become involved in Angola nor was our advice sought. ” This was not true. In his memoirs, Kissinger’s account of the entire enterprise in Angola can only be described as extremely misleading. While the Western alliance hid its actions and hoped for the best, Castro saw Angola as an ideal opportunity to pursue his African campaign. When Cuban emissary Major Raúl Díaz Argüelles returned from Angola in early August 1975, he told Raúl Castro, Fidel’s brother and eventual successor: “[MPLA leader Agostinho Neto] wants to make the situation in Angola a vital issue between the systems of Imperialism and Socialism  …     [T]he sides are clearly defined, the FNLA and UNITA represent the international Imperialist forces and the Portuguese reac tion, and the MPLA represents the progressive and nationalist forces. ” Cuba agreed wholeheartedly with this framing of the conflict, and when South Africa’s military intervention was uncovered, the   alliance found it had a public relations bonanza on its hands. For Castro, however, what was at stake was much more than just a Cold War win. In the initial conflict, South Africa’s military surged northwards until it was halted by the Cubans in late 1975 a nearly   stalemate ensued. Over 337, 000 Cuban soldiers served in Angola, of whom over 2, 000 died, according to official figures. But Havana’s contribution went far beyond the military. As historian Edward George notes, “For a generation of Cubans, internationalist service in Angola represented the highest ideal of the Cuban Revolution. ” Waves of doctors, teachers, and engineers flooded   Angola, while thousands of talented Angolan students received scholarships to study back in Cuba. Washington and Pretoria offered nothing of the kind. As the revolutionary cause stalled in Algeria,   and elsewhere, and Havana’s clients in Ethiopia turned out to be (among other things) murderous thugs, Angola became the showcase for Castro’s ideology. The main target of this policy was not so much the United States, but South Africa’s apartheid regime. From the late 1970s onwards, black political mobilization intensified, the country’s racially stratified economy stalled, and white manpower and expertise became ever scarcer, as the lure of a   life in Australia or Britain grew. In this context, Cuba forced the apartheid regime to fight a costly war of attrition, thousands of miles from South Africa. Into the 1980s, its government repeatedly increased taxes to pay for the sustained military effort. Vast quantities of political and economic resources were divested in an effort to circumvent military sanctions and produce sophisticated weapons systems at home. The government itself became steadily militarized. Conscription for white males was extended to fully two years this only boosted emigration, while many returned home from the front disillusioned, or worse. Castro’s military was never quite able to land a   blow on the battlefield. Part of that was due to ongoing American support for the   Africa alliance in southern Angola. America’s covert operatives were useful, but it was the diplomatic protection and copious funding that was invaluable, because the South Africans and UNITA struggled to provide either. Both Presidents Ronald Reagan and  George H. W. Bush hosted UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi at the White House, despite the fact that his organization was known to traffic in conflict diamonds, conscript child soldiers, and impose strict discipline in its ranks through burning dissenters at the stake. The MPLA’s human rights record, too,  was hardly spotless. America’s political alignment with the apartheid regime remains a black spot on its national past. Even as late as 1986, Reagan vetoed the Comprehensive   Act, the very same year that South Africa’s Broederbond, a shadowy   organization for Afrikaner elites, itself disavowed apartheid. When choosing between defending the paragon of global racism —  even as apartheid’s most ardent backers were themselves looking in new directions —  and softening its hard line against Cuba, Washington chose the former. In the third world, it was yet another public relations victory for Fidel Castro, all in spite of his human rights record and Cuba’s unappealing economic model at home. No wonder coming to terms with his legacy is so difficult. None of this should obscure the many failures and contradictions of Cuba’s African foreign policy. Most of Castro’s partners calcified into   regimes manifesting few of his lofty ideals. Castro’s opposite number in the MPLA’s Angolan regime was José Eduardo dos Santos —  still the leader of Angola today. Few of Cuba’s allies fully reciprocated Castro’s generosity. In this context, it seems likely that much of the enduring enthusiasm on the part of Havana for its African mission stemmed from its ideological value. Foreign successes perhaps helped to obscure that the revolution was stalling badly at home. Then there was the unmissable irony at the heart of the whole policy: Havana made judgments about which   movements most resembled its model for the future, and then put its credibility in the hands of local leaders with their own priorities —  similar to what Washington was doing at the same time. But there was one big win. Cuba’s deeply improbable campaign in distant southern Africa was an important factor in the demise of apartheid, though it was not, as some claim, the dominant or decisive one. The South African system was imploding anyhow, as the Broederbond’s 1986 epiphany attests. But the war did accelerate a loss of white confidence in the regime and its apartheid model. Cuba’s campaign indirectly forced white voters and their family members to personally sacrifice in defense of apartheid —  sacrifices they were, ultimately, unwilling to continue making. By contrast, Castro was prepared to bear the costs of his vision, and to force them upon Cuba. “The cost in human terms is enormous,” he told Neto. “This effort requires great sacrifice for tens of thousands of families who have a son, or a father, or a brother abroad. ” As this revealing statement suggests, Fidel Castro’s African adventure —  improbable as it was —  was hardly without contradictions.",-0.5
"Inside the WH scramble to defend Trump on Comey. Sources at the White House described scenes of confusion in the hours following news of Trump firing Comey. Internally, at least at a fairly senior level, people were scrambling to figure out what happened. The firing was done in such haste that his own comms shop couldn't catch up, and the vast majority of White House staff learned about it on TV when the news broke, per White House sources. There was a meeting in Spicer's office with about 20 staffers after they announced the news, which happened as Chuck Schumer was on TV giving his response to the news of the firing. Democrats were on message within minutes: special prosecutor, constitutional crisis, Nixonian. Republicans did not have a coherent response. This left Trump exposed in a way that horrified his officials, and the White House response was so weak that Trump took to Twitter as his own crisis communications manager. From a White House official: ""it's insane. The whole thing is just insane."" The big takeaway: how exposed White House officials and Trump confidants felt. They didn't have the information, the preparation, the tools, to defend the President. The big questions: Where were the surrogates who could defend Trump's decision? Jason Miller and Kellyanne Conway were ""one-man flak jackets,"" per multiple people, but where were the law enforcement and AG surrogates?",0.0
"CDC warns pregnant women to avoid Miami over Zika | TheHill. Federal health authorities are warning pregnant women not to travel to the parts of Miami where mosquitoes are believed to be spreading the Zika virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued the advisory Monday, three days after Florida health officials confirmed several people had contracted the virus locally, almost certainly from mosquitoes. The state announced Monday that the number of cases had risen to 14 over the weekend. It’s the CDC’s latest travel advisory for pregnant women over the last year and the first in the continental U.S. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters Monday that the move is unprecedented, and that the center had issued “no similar recommendation in recent years.” The travel advisory applies to a small part of Miami: All 14 cases have been reported in one square mile, just north of downtown. And so far, only two of the 14 infected people in Florida are women. The CDC is only telling women who are already pregnant not to travel to the area. For women who are trying to conceive, the CDC is telling women to wait at least eight weeks after they return from their trip and test negative for Zika, which can cause birth defects in the newborns of women who contract the disease while pregnant. In a conference call on Monday, Frieden said the agency decided to issue a travel warning because attempts to control mosquitoes “don’t seem to be working as well as we’d like.” He said “it’s possible” that mosquitoes are resistant to the insecticides being used or that there are “cryptic breeding places” in the city. It’s also possible, he said, that “this is a very difficult mosquito to control, particularly in a complex urban environment.” Frieden said he expects many more cases, though he doesn’t believe there will be a massive outbreak. “Nothing that we’ve seen indicates widespread transmission, but it’s certainly possible there could be sustained transmission in certain areas,” Frieden said Monday. The CDC is also stepping up its presence in Florida, dispatching an emergency response team to help investigate, research and sample mosquitoes in the area. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) had formally asked the federal government for emergency help earlier Monday. He has called for additional funding to fight Zika for months. More than 200 people have been tested for Zika over the last three weeks, after the state health department began investigating possible local transmission of the virus. A total of 2,300 people have been tested statewide since the outbreak began last year. About 300 have tested positive — more than any other state.  While Scott urged people, particularly pregnant women, to take precaution, he also sought to reassure the public that it remained safe to travel to Florida this summer. “Florida remains safe and open for business,” Scott said.

"The Fed is freaking out about financial markets—commentary. Early in the new year, on Jan. 3, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer delivered a hawkish speech to the American Economic Association. Completely misreading the economy, which is woefully weak while inflation is virtually nil, Fischer strongly hinted that the Fed would be raising its target rate by a quarter of a percent every quarter for the next three years. The next day the S&P 500 dropped 1.5 percent. In the week that followed, the broad index fell 6 percent. The week after that it fell over 2 percent. During that two-week period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,437 points. The dollar went up. Oil plunged 21 percent. Raw material commodities dropped. And credit risk spreads in the high-yield junk market rose substantially. Actually, it was a global event, as stock markets around the world plunged. Utter chaos. This past week, the Fed retreated in its policy statement. For the first time in a long while, it didn't bother with a risk assessment between inflation and employment. The whole statement had a much softer tone. It reminded me of the prevent defense of the old Bill Parcells New York Giants. Putting it more starkly, I'd say the Fed is completely freaked out by financial markets that are turning against it. The central bank says its policies are ""data driven."" But the recent Federal Open Market Committee statement suggests the Fed is looking at everything. It has a hundred indicators — domestic, international, jobs, and inflation. In truth, it doesn't know what its next move is going to be because it can't read the economy. Fed policy is opaque, confusing, and rudderless. Take a look at the new GDP report for the fourth quarter of last year. A mere 0.7 percent growth. Across 2015, real GDP grew 1.8 percent. It's not a recession. But any shock could push us into recession. Business investment fell. Commercial building fell. Inventories fell. Inflation came in less than 1 percent. Nominal GDP — real output plus inflation — registered a small 1.5 percent gain. In normal times, money GDP should be between 4 and 5 percent. Perhaps most troublesome to the stock market and the economy is the decline in corporate profits. According to most estimates, profits are set to drop for the third straight quarter while business sales look to be falling for the fourth straight quarter. Add this to less than 1 percent economic growth, and the risk of recession is surely rising. The recession threat is a risk, not a fact. But for Fed policy makers to tell us the economy is healthy is a complete misreading of the situation. And with ultra-weak economic growth and ultra-low inflation, how could the Fed, or any central bank, think about tightening policy? Besides stocks, other market indicators are trying to tell the central bank: No More Rate Hikes. Copper is down 16 percent over the past year. Inflation expectations in the Treasury-bond markets have fallen significantly. And the dollar over the past several years has increased roughly 30 percent. A healthy King Dollar is a good thing, and so are falling energy prices. But enough is enough. More Fed rate hikes will raise the dollar and reduce energy prices so much that the economy will be completely disrupted. A stable, reliable greenback is a good thing. But let's not press our luck. Now, if the Fed were operating on a true price rule, it would keep the dollar where it is today for as far as the eye can see. In turn, that would stabilize gold and other commodities and avoid further economic disruption. In a speech back in 2014, former Fed head Paul Volcker argued for a rules-based monetary policy along with international currency cooperation. Right now, we have neither. Europe and Japan have moved toward negative interest rates while the Fed threatens higher rates. Where is Volcker's currency diplomacy? Nowhere to be seen. Thankfully there's a way out of this mess. Let the Fed keep interest rates and the dollar stable. No more tightening. Meanwhile, the Republican Congress can pass a significant tax cut for large and small businesses. Push the rate down to 15 percent for C-corps and S-corps. Provide easy repatriation of U.S. money overseas. And permit immediate tax write-offs for new-business-investment expenses. Congress could also push for reduced regulatory burdens, although it looks like there's no stopping the Obama administration's unconstitutional march toward even greater regulations. But a big business tax cut would be the most stimulative way to move the economy from near recession to 4 or 5 percent growth. That's what we need. Put it together with a stable and reliable dollar, and we can move from pessimism to optimism. It's been done before. We can do it again.

"Clinton’s Court: Legal analysts say gun rights and more at stake in November.   The Supreme Court  —   it’s no secret  —   is at stake in the 2016 election. But legal experts say the impact will be far more sweeping if Hillary Clinton wins in the fall, and is able to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia with a   judge. That point was only underscored at last week’s Democratic convention, where the Democratic presidential nominee pushed for changes on everything from campaign finance to gun rights, at times citing the court’s role. Here’s a closer look at what’s at stake, with many of these issues likely to come before the next court: Campaign finance, Appealing in part to Sen. Bernie Sanders supporters, Hillary Clinton made campaign finance restrictions a centerpiece of her convention remarks last week. “We need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics,” Clinton said in her speech in Philadelphia. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → But many legal experts say doing that also involves rolling back protections on political speech. The focus of the   ire is the decision in the case known as Citizens United. In 2008, Citizens United    an organization with corporate funding    produced a documentary criticizing Clinton and was sued because there was a ban on such groups mentioning a candidate in a broadcast within 60 days of an election. The Supreme Court allowed the   film to be aired close to elections, by a narrow   decision. It also went further and said government has no power under the Constitution to ban corporate political speech in general, in turn lifting such spending restrictions. Both President Obama and Clinton condemned that ruling, saying it gives corporations too much power. Some legal analysts now say a court with a Clinton appointee could rule that companies have no right to run videos that criticize a candidate close to an election. “I think [Citizens United] would likely be overturned, given the statements from Clinton, and the likely position of her nominees,” UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, who specializes in the First Amendment, told FoxNews. com. Legal experts told FoxNews. com it was the most certain change to expect under a Clinton court. “The court would definitely be inclined to reverse Citizens United,” said David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University. Second Amendment   Clinton also vowed in her convention address that she had no interest in repealing the Second Amendment and wants only to pass   reforms. But the Democratic candidate has taken issue with the high court’s current view of gun rights. Leaked audio from a Clinton fundraiser in 2015 revealed Clinton telling donors “the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. ” Legal analysts say a Clinton appointee could mean the court would no longer consider Americans to have an individual right to “keep and bear arms”  —   a right the court only affirmed by a narrow   decision in 2008. “They may reverse that decision, or they may limit it so it doesn’t mean much,” Bernstein said. Several experts said the court would most likely take a stealthy approach to avoid causing too many political problems. But it would still mark a change in the judicial winds for gun rights. “They would say ‘you have the individual right to bear arms, but it’s subject to reasonable regulation    loosely defined,’” Bernstein said, noting that the “reasonable regulation” could include policies such as a handgun ban for all citizens unless a person could convince authorities they have a “good reason” to own one. Such bans might then be implemented by cities such as Chicago and Washington, D. C. which banned handguns until the courts recently forced them to allow ownership.   Religious freedom, Analysts say a Clinton Supreme Court also would likely weigh in on religious freedoms, potentially by requiring more companies to provide contraceptive coverage and forcing wedding caterers and photographers to serve gay weddings. “They would probably overturn Hobby Lobby,” Bernstein said, referring to a   decision in 2014 that said the government may not force companies to provide health insurance for certain kinds of contraception  —   as long as there are only a few owners of the company and the contraception would conflict with their religious beliefs. School vouchers at religious schools, Some liberal justices say using school vouchers at religious schools violates the First Amendment clause that forbids the government from establishing a religion. ”There is at least a good possibility that the court would reverse itself and say that you can’t have vouchers that go to religious schools,” Bernstein told FoxNews. com, noting the court also might be too concerned about the political repercussions to do so. Death penalty, While the Constitution itself imposes the death penalty for treason, some liberal justices say the death penalty may still be unconstitutional because it violates other rights. The new 2016 Democratic Party platform also calls for the abolition of the death penalty for the first time. University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt, who specializes in the Constitution, said he sees the shift happening on the Supreme Court. ”I could see the death penalty being invalidated    it looks as though some of the sitting justices have been moving in that direction,” he said.  Voter ID laws, This is another subject Clinton tied to the Supreme Court in her convention speech, saying America needs Supreme Court justices who will ”expand voting rights, not restrict them.” Voter ID laws, largely passed by   states, have been in the crosshairs of Democrats for years. Critics  —   including allied justices  —   argue that such laws are unconstitutional because minorities are less likely to have IDs. Under a Clinton court, Bernstein said, ”I think you can expect that voter ID laws will go down.” Overall impact, Plenty of other issues, from union power to discrimination rules and more, also could come before the new court. Legal experts who spoke with FoxNews. com differed on how likely each of the above changes are    but they agreed that major changes would be likely under Clinton. ”The court will side more with the government and against individual liberty,” William and Mary law professor Alan Meese told FoxNews. com. Legal experts cautioned that a   court may not act on all of the above. “The Supreme Court generally doesn’t like to [overturn recent decisions] because it makes them look political, but for some of these cases I could imagine it happening,” Roosevelt said, adding he thinks a Clinton court would not outright rule that the Second Amendment is not an individual right and would likely leave school vouchers and voter ID laws intact in some cases. The impact of a Donald Trump court, analysts said, is harder to pin down but likely to cause fewer changes  —   as a Trump nominee probably would be ideologically similar to Scalia. “On the average, his justices will be more likely to enforce conservative constitutional principles,” Bernstein told FoxNews. com.

"Fed rate hikes in July or September are now a ‘crapshoot’: Strategist. The Federal Reserve may not be ready to raise interest rates until the Christmas holidays roll around, Federated Chief Equity Strategist Phil Orlando said Thursday. Orlando made his comments one day after the Federal Open Market Committee left rates unchanged and more members of the policymaking group indicated they anticipate just one hike this year rather than two. Orlando said the decision merely reflected the reality of the marketplace. The Fed is staring down slower labor force improvement, weaker inflation, ""terrible"" first-quarter corporate earnings and a British vote on its European Union membership that now amounts to a coin flip, he said. ""We're not overly pessimistic. We're realistic that the data right now doesn't support an aggressive Fed,"" Orlando told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""We feel really good about December, but July or September is going to be a tougher call. The data's got to support that, and right now, that's a crapshoot,"" he said. The odds of a July rate hike fellow to below 10 percent, and the chances of an increase in September dropped to 22 percent immediately following the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, according to Fed Fund futures data provided by RBS. The uncertainty expressed by the Fed on Wednesday is bad for the market, said Alison Deans, consultant at AA Deans Advisors and a CNBC contributor. ""We're relying way too much on the Fed to solve all of our problems, and the Fed can't solve our problems,"" she told ""Squawk Box."" What's missing is good fiscal policy from Washington, she said. Orlando agrees with that assessment. He said in this environment, it's crucial to play defense. Federated's mix of stocks to bonds is at its lowest level since the Great Recession, he said. ""We've got more cash, more bonds. We like gold. We've got defensive allocations in equities. The stock market's going lower. You've got to play defense here, "" he said.",0.0
"What’s Marco Missing?. Manchester, N. H.  —   24 hours after Marco Rubio’s first real stumble on the national stage, he was back on script. A crowd of about 500 had packed into a sports facility covered in green astroturf to hear the Florida senator speak, but somehow he seemed diminished. His voice was difficult to hear, echoing into the space. He wrapped up without taking questions from the audience. These shortcomings weren’t Rubio’s fault, but they reinforced the impression that Chris Christie had dealt him a real blow in Saturday’s Republican debate by mocking his refusal to deviate from a set of canned remarks. The view in the top echelons of the Rubio campaign has always been that debates can’t help candidates, they can only hurt. As he returned to his prepared remarks on Sunday, it was even more apparent in the wake of Saturday’s misstep that Rubio was playing to type in a way that voters may not even have been aware of before Christie pointed it out. “Now, every time Rubio does one of his ‘son of a bartender’ speeches, people are going to be like, ‘There he goes again,’” says a top Republican operative. RELATED: Rubio’s Momentum Stalls in New Hampshire Debate, One Republican operative close to the Rubio campaign puts it to me this way: Rubio, he says, has “zero swagger, zero cockiness. ” Another political observer says what he lacks is stage presence, an ability to appear as if he’s “quietly dominating everybody in the room. ” And it’s true, Marco Rubio will never gut a challenger with a smirk and a nod, as George W. Bush did to Al Gore, or by gently mocking his argument, as Ronald Reagan did to Jimmy Carter: “There you go again . . . ” Share article on FacebookshareTweet Caught off guard, Rubio has been hesitant to throw a punch at any of his rivals on the debate stage. In the sixth Republican presidential debate in Charleston, he was asked about an ad aired by his super PAC that hit Christie for supporting Common Core and expanding Medicaid in New Jersey, among other things. Rubio’s response foreshadowed his wobbly performance in Manchester. “We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country’s security,” he said, before moderator Neil Cavuto cut him off. “That’s not my question,” Cavuto said. After more prodding, Rubio responded, “I like Chris Christie, but we cannot afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core. . . . Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood. All I’m saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country. It cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda. ” The super PAC ad, which aired here in New Hampshire, had done real damage to Christie’s prospects: At one point, the New Jersey governor appeared to have some momentum in the Granite State, but he had watched his approval rate plummet 20 points over the course of just two weeks as the ad aired across the state. Given a chance to deliver a knockout punch to Christie’s campaign in Charleston, Rubio refused.

Discipline isn’t exactly a bad thing in politics and, while Rubio’s deficiencies are somewhat difficult to pinpoint, those of his challengers are relatively easy to define: Jeb Bush is boring Ted Cruz is grating John Kasich is undisciplined and Christie is a bully.    As the clock ticks toward primary day here in New Hampshire, there’s a growing sense that while the state may not crown the Republican nominee, it will nonetheless prove a turning point in the race by providing a view of who is actually plausible, and whether there’s a chance the outsiders will ultimately give way to the mainstreamers. In that regard, what New Hampshire makes of Rubio’s qualities  —   the ones he possesses and the ones he lacks  —   will be important.",1.0
"Trump targets cheap Chinese steel in probe, rallying U.S. steel stocks.  President Donald Trump on Thursday launched a trade probe against China and other exporters of cheap steel into the U. S. market, raising the possibility of new tariffs and sending shares of some U. S. steel makers up over 8 percent. Citing concerns about national security, Trump made the announcement at a White House ceremony with U. S. steel executives from Nucor Corp ( ) United States Steel Corp ( ) and TimkenSteel Corp ( ) alongside Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire businessman who made part of his fortune investing in the steel business.  ”Steel is critical to both our economy and our military,” said Trump, a Republican. ”This is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries.” Trump won many votes in industrial states like Michigan and Pennsylvania with a pledge to boost manufacturing and crack down on Chinese trade practices. China is the largest national producer and makes far more steel than it consumes, selling the excess output overseas, often undercutting domestic producers. The unusual step of launching an investigation comes as Trump is pressuring China to do more to rein in an increasingly belligerent North Korea. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Trump in Florida earlier this month, Trump raised the possibility of using trade as a lever to coax China to do more.    “Everything they export is dumping,” said Derek Scissors, Asia economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. Ross cast the decision to initiate the probe as a response to Chinese exports of steel into the United States reaching the point where they now account for 26 percent of the U. S. market. Chinese exports have risen ”despite repeated Chinese claims that they were going to reduce their steel capacity,” said Ross, whom The Economist, a business magazine that champions free trade, in 2004 labeled ”Mr. Protectionism” for his history of owning businesses protected from foreign competition. Ross said that if the Commerce inquiry finds the U. S. steel industry is suffering from too much steel imports, he will recommend retaliatory steps that could include tariffs.  Diverging from the Obama administration’s approach to the issue, which relied largely on filing complaints to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trump ordered a probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which lets the president impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. In October 2001, a Commerce Department investigation found ”no probative evidence” that imports of iron ore and   steel threaten to impair U. S. national security. Steel shares had rallied after Trump won the November election amid promises for increased infrastructure spending. On Thursday shares of Steel Dynamics Inc ( ) AK Steel Holding Corp ( ) Cliffs Natural Resources Inc ( ) Allegheny Technologies Inc ( ) and other steel makers closed between 4 percent and 8. 5 percent higher. PROFITS CITED The United States has nearly 100 plants that make millions of tons of steel annually. The U. S. government has attempted to shield them from cheap foreign steel chiefly through the WTO, but the Trump administration said this has had little impact. ”The artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the American steel industry,” the administration said in a statement. Nucor Chairman John Ferriola said in a statement that the steelmaker welcomed the president’s move. ”We look forward to continuing to work with the president and Secretary Ross to ensure our trade laws are enforced so that U. S. manufacturers can compete on a   field,” he said. Experts were skeptical about the administration’s argument that cheap Chinese steel threatened U. S. national security. The Defense Department’s annual steel requirements comprise less than 0. 3 percent of the industry’s output by weight. “There is no doubt that steel plays a role in our national security and the manufacturing of U. S. weapons systems,” said Jeff Bialos, a partner at law firm Eversheds Sutherland, who has worked on steel trade cases in the past. ”But the Department of Defense only consumes a small portion of domestic steel output, and this has decreased over the past decade as composites technology has advanced,” Bialos said. Some of the military’s largest consumers of steel are U. S. Navy shipbuilders Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc ( ) and Lockheed Martin Corp ( ). Scissors said the United States has other ways to take on China over steel trade issues, other than invoking national security. “Talking about it as a national security issue   I don’t think it’s necessary and I don’t think it’s justified,” he said.

"Boston shooting: Suspect plotted to kill Pamela Geller.  (CNN) Usaamah Rahim, who was fatally shot after waving a military knife at law enforcement officers in Boston, was originally plotting to behead Pamela Geller, an activist and conservative blogger, law enforcement sources told CNN on Wednesday.  But Rahim, a    security guard who officials believe was radicalized by ISIS and other extremists, decided instead to target the ”boys in blue,” a reference to police, according to court documents. ”I can’t wait that long,” he said of the original beheading plan, according to an FBI affidavit filed in federal court in Boston. Geller drew national attention last month after an   police officer working security thwarted an attack at her organization’s contest for Prophet Mohammed drawings in Garland, Texas. She’s president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, which includes subsidiary programs Stop Islamization of America and Stop Islamization of Nations. ”They targeted me for violating Sharia blasphemy laws. They mean to kill everyone who doesn’t do their bidding and abide by their law voluntarily,” Geller told CNN’s Erin Burnett after learning of the alleged plot. ”This is a showdown for American freedom. Will we stand against this savagery or bow down to them and silence ourselves?” Geller said that she’s had an ”army of security” since last month’s Texas incident. ”This is what is required just to show a cartoon in America, 2015,” she said. ”It’s striking. It’s devastating, and people need to understand what’s at stake. I mean, if we surrender on this point, what will we surrender next?” Who is beheading plot target Pamela Geller? ’The easiest target’ About two hours before Rahim’s confrontation Tuesday with officers on a Boston street, he allegedly told an associate he was ”going to . .. go after them, those boys in blue. ’Cause . .. it’s the easiest target,” the documents say. Rahim’s alleged associate, David Wright, 25, appeared in U. S. District Court in Boston to face a charge of obstructing a federal investigation by destroying electronic evidence on Rahim’s smartphone. A detention hearing was scheduled for June 19 after prosecutors said he was a flight risk.  Wright allegedly attempted to destroy Rahim’s cell phone and conceal evidence of their plans, according to the documents. Wright faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted. Rahim purchased three military fighting knives with blades longer than 8 inches on Amazon. com, the court documents said. ”I just got myself a nice little tool,” Rahim allegedly told his associate, according to the court documents. ”You know it’s good for carving wood and . .. carving sculptures.”  In a recorded conversation, the two men are then heard laughing. They apparently share some history. Under the alias ”Abu Sufyaan,” Rahim thanked his nephew, ”Dawud Sharif ” an alias of Wright, for witnessing his wedding, according to a 2013 Facebook post.  Wright’s attorney called for caution. ”I would urge the government, the FBI and law enforcement, in investigating this case and related cases, to be as transparent as possible, and in enforcing the law, to abide by the law,” Jessica Hedges told reporters. ”We have serious concerns about that already.”   surveillance  Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said surveillance video shows four or five officers approach Rahim without their weapons drawn. The officers backtrack as he comes after them and gets ”close enough to cause imminent harm.” They eventually draw their weapons and open fire. ”We never anticipated what his reaction would be and that he would pull out . .. a military knife and approach the officers,” Evans said.    authorities had Rahim under   surveillance, said Vincent B. Lisi, FBI special agent in charge. Rahim was a subject of a terror investigation involving suspected Islamist extremists, law enforcement sources said.  ”We believe he was a threat,” Evans said. ”He was someone we were watching for quite some time.” The FBI noted a recent change in Rahim’s behavior, including social media threats against police, which prompted agents to try to approach him, according to an official. Shooting video, Authorities showed the surveillance video of the incident during an unusual meeting with religious and civil rights leaders in an attempt to allay community concerns about the shooting.  Rahim was not on the phone at the time of the shooting and was not shot in the back, as had been reported by a relative, according to clergy and civic leaders who met with authorities earlier Wednesday. ”What the video does reveal to us very clearly is that the individual was not on the cell phone, the individual was not shot in the back and that the information reported by others that that was the case was inaccurate,” Darnell Williams, president and chief executive of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts, said at a news conference with the police commissioner and others. Rahim’s brother has posted on social media that the suspect was on the phone with their father and was shot three times in the back during the confrontation with police.   Williams said prosecutors want Rahim’s family to see the video before showing it to the public.  The religious and civic leaders said Rahim appeared to be shot three times    in the shoulder, abdomen and chest. Police had earlier reported that he was struck two times.  Imam Abdullah Faaruuq, speaking for the Muslim community, said the video was inconclusive.  ”I don’t think that he was shot in the back. . .. However we couldn’t see clearly at all,” he said. He added, ”We can’t say what happened. We weren’t there. We do see a very vague video that is not clear as to what transpired. It wasn’t at a bus stop. He wasn’t shot in the back and there is not detail enough on the video to tell us exactly what happened.”   A third associate, The   task force had been watching Rahim and two associates also believed to be radicalized, according to a law enforcement official. Rahim had been monitored for at least a couple of years. Investigators were talking to the associates, and various locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island were being searched, officials said. The Rhode Island raid was connected to a third person believed to be associated with Wright and Usaamah Rahim, according to two federal law enforcement sources. The third person was connected by more than just an ”Internet relationship,” one law enforcement source said. The sources did not provide a name for the individual they were investigating. The FBI is still investigating whether more people are connected with the three.",-1.0
"Ted Cruz: ‘Attacks’ From Donald Trump ‘Henchmen’ Are ‘Garbage’ - Breitbart. 2016 Presidential contender Ted Cruz is accusing Donald Trump of playing a part in accusations of infidelity launched against the Texas senator in the National Enquirer. [Ted Cruz posted to Facebook on Friday:  I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won’t go. These smears are completely false, they’re offensive to Heidi and me, they’re offensive to our daughters, and they’re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack. Donald Trump’s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. The National Enquirer piece cited an anonymous source and accused Cruz of multiple extramarital affairs. Cruz pointed out in a Friday morning press conference that the gossip magazine piece ran the day after Trump’s accusation against Cruz for the Make America Awesome PAC ad including the Melania Trump modeling photo. Roger Stone told USA Today via email: Everything I know about these allegations I heard from credible reporters for the MSM  …    I played no role in the placement of the story. Trump and Cruz have been locked in a battle over their wives since a   Super PAC ran an ad with partially nude modeling photos of Trump’s wife Melania aimed at Utah Mormon women. Trump accused Cruz of running the photo. Breitbart News reported on the exchange between the two top Republican presidential contenders that led Cruz to tell reporters on Thursday: “It’s not easy to tick me off.

"How BioShock Mocked Video-Game Morality.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Near the beginning of the groundbreaking video game BioShock, the player is forced to make what seems like a crucial moral decision: You liberate a   child who has been tormenting the local populace, and are told you can either kill it for a huge reward, or let it go free, but gain far less in the process. BioShock is filled with these moments —     choices that seemingly add to a larger ethical experience for the user in a departure from the usually   nature of playing video games. Upon its 2007 release, BioShock felt like a revolution, or at least the start of one. The complexity of its   approach was basic to say the least the game only branched into two endings. Nine years after its initial release, BioShock is now available in a remastered,   edition with its sequels —  three games in total that proclaimed to allow players to examine their own values as they ventured through dark, fantastic worlds. The idea of multiple moral paths to a player’s story became a fad that video games are still struggling to incorporate, and BioShock: The Collection shows both the appeal, and the necessary limitations, of the ideas the original game generated. BioShock wasn’t the first of its kind to offer users an array plot outcomes, based on how they behaved while playing. Advanced   games like BioWare’s Knights of the Old Republic, set in the Star Wars universe, would categorize the player as being on good or evil depending on how they behaved, though that only really affected the character’s appearance. But, of course, video games had largely functioned on rails for the entirety of their existence: A player’s job was to rescue the princess, to get the treasure, to destroy the bad guy, and everything in the game existed to push the player in a single direction. Date Night With the Zombies, In BioShock, the main moral conundrum is a simple one, and revolves around the game’s Little Sisters, young girls who walk around tormenting the citizens of the underwater city of Rapture. If you “Harvest” them, their life force helps power your own magic weapons if you instead heal them and send them on their merry way, you get less power, but the satisfaction of doing the right thing. Behave one way, and you get a “happy” video played at the end of the game, assuring you that your character lived a good life behave another, and the Sisters take brutal revenge on you, tearing you apart. The only huge difference was the ending  .  What made BioShock truly interesting was that while it allowed players to exercise their ethical judgment, it also cleverly acknowledged the larger reality of gaming: that players actually don’t have much choice at all (spoilers for the first game’s ending follow). As BioShock’s protagonist wanders through Rapture’s surreal underwater world, battling the crazed survivors of mass human experimentation, he’s guided by a helpful voice calling himself “Atlas. ” Atlas is a supposed rebel that’s looking to bring down Andrew Ryan, the tyrannical leader of Rapture, an Art Deco nightmare that he founded based on the principles of objectivism and the philosophies of Ayn Rand. In the end, Atlas is revealed to be the game’s true villain, a gangster trying to seize power in Rapture the player is his sleeper agent, who’s unwittingly forced to do Atlas’s bidding any time he utters the phrase “would you kindly” (which he does, often). It was a brilliant twist and the game’s way of ultimately mocking the illusion of choice it supposedly offered. Yes, there were moments along the way where you could approach situations from various angles. But BioShock understood that the medium of video games is always going to be   and the designed worlds still exist for one player to navigate a very specific story toward   endings. Play BioShock again with the twist in mind, and you catch every utterance of  “would you kindly. ” It always comes when there’s no choice at all: You have to move on to the next level, or pick up that weapon, or kill whatever big boss Atlas is pointing you at next. Yes, he leaves the decision about the Little Sisters to you, but that’s just one small element in an otherwise scripted story. It was subversively   for the time —  in 2007, BioShock was actively experimenting with the medium and the small choices it could offer the user. But its designer, Ken Levine, also wanted to make it clear that there was only so much he could do within the constraints of the medium. Two sequels, also included in BioShock: The Collection, were largely regarded as disappointments. BioShock 2 (2010) which Levin didn’t design, revisited the world of Rapture and put the player in the skin of one of its coolest monsters: the Big Daddy, a   behemoth clad in a   diving suit. Though the game embellished on some of the most appealing design elements of the first BioShock, it had much less to offer in terms of original storytelling. BioShock Infinite (2013) a “spiritual sequel” from Levine set in the new dystopia of a steampunk city in the sky, was far more ambitious. Infinite retained the moral nuance of BioShock, often presenting its users with small crises to resolve in multiple ways. But this time it had no impact on the overall ending, which was much a more convoluted, fully scripted affair involving  . After the release of BioShock,   storytelling was briefly the biggest fad in gaming, with games like Dishonored and Deus Ex: Human Revolution making it the backbone of their advertising. But designers largely struggled to integrate such choices in an interesting way. The acclaimed   series Mass Effect let its protagonist behave as a morally upright hero or a rude, selfish renegade, which could affect whether other characters lived or died as the game went on. But that series’ ending was widely criticized for being unable to close the circle: For all the supposed free will a player could exercise, there was really only one way for the game to end. Now, there’s a   of games geared toward “decision trees,” many of them produced by the innovative studio Telltale Games. This slightly soapier genre strips away much of the adventure of a     game. Telltale’s series based on The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones play like Choose Your Own Adventure books, and are essentially living graphic novels that present the user with tough decisions, rather than oncoming enemies or interactive puzzles. It’s a specific genre that has a growing fan base, but it lacks the immersive feel of a bigger, more complex gaming experience.   Near the end of BioShock, before confronting  Atlas, the player is led before Andrew Ryan, the supposed antagonist who created Rapture and saw it spin out of his control. In one of gaming’s most iconic scenes, Ryan uses the player’s trigger phrase against him, to prove some grand philosophical point: “A man chooses a slave obeys,” he barks, ordering the player to kill him. At this point, the game takes over, turning off the controls and forcing the player to do as Ryan says. Video gaming has made titanic strides in storytelling since its earliest days since the release of BioShock, the medium’s horizons have only broadened further. But nine years after its release, the most revolutionary thing about the game was how cleverly it admitted that, in some ways, it wasn’t revolutionary at all.",-0.5
"Election 2016: Knowns and Unknowns. The Disaffected. Will     establishment Republicans outnumber renewed Reagan Democrats, Tea Partiers, and conservative independents, some of whom likely sat out 2008 and 2012, but who now are likely to vote for Trump? The latter energized group will probably continue to support Trump even if he persists in his suicidal detours like the legal gymnastics of Trump University, or if he keeps repeating ad nauseam the same stale generalities he has served up throughout his campaign. And will the ranks of the #NeverTrump holdouts, despite claims to the contrary in the spring, thin by autumn, should Trump change a few of his odious spots and become a more disciplined candidate? Will his populist message be recalibrated to appeal to minorities who, albeit less publicly than their white counterparts, resent illegal immigration and its effects on the poor and working classes, are angry about record labor nonparticipation and elite boutique environmentalism, and appreciate tough, even if crazed, El Jefe talk in place of politically correct platitudes?   vs.  . Will Sanders holdouts roughly approximate the number of Republican #NeverTrumpers? For now, it would be more socially acceptable for a Sanders supporter to vote for Hillary than for an   to give in and vote for Trump. Voting for Hillary would not entail the social and class costs for a Sanders supporter that voting for Trump would for a Republican of the “   ” Romney or Jeb Bush wing. The Wall Street Journal is more likely to show repugnance for the idea of finishing the wall than an advocate of Sanders’s 70 percent top tax rate is to reject Hillary’s less radical, though radical enough, idea of upping the current 39. 5 percent top rate. An oddity of the campaign is that the Republican establishment applies a higher standard to its own candidate than it has applied to either Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, who, with a modicum of research, can be proven to have matched Trump, slur for slur. RELATED: Did #NeverTrump Have to Happen? RELATED: The Facts Keep Undermining Hillary’s   Tales, The Obama Matrix. Pollsters are still trying to calibrate to what degree Hillary will recapture Obama’s record minority registration, turnout, and block voting  —   and whether such pandering will in turn spike the     vote to record levels. There is something foreign and uncomfortable about Hillary’s   performances perhaps her shrill obsequiousness will strike at least some minority voters as a sort of elite white and repugnant condescension. No one likes a transparent   especially by someone whose past record of honesty and character is so disreputable. Conventional wisdom suggests that the supposed “new” demography will allow Hillary to replicate the Obama coalition, but that assumes that minority voters, who supposedly vote along ethnic and racial lines, are comfortable with Hillary’s tastes and with her disingenuous career, and will vote as they did in 2008 and 2012, more than making up for new    converts to Trump. RELATED: Republicans Are Stuck with Donald Trump until November  Trump Factor X. Will the   “Trump disconnect” continue, an intangible that for over a year has humiliated pundits who have made serially erroneous forecasts of his demise? In other words, no one has yet been able to calibrate the degree to which Trump has made politics irrelevant and substituted harsh, politically incorrect, and often crude expression and rhetoric for any kind of detailed agenda. No one knows quite how the weird Trump factor that propelled him through the primaries will play in the far wider arena of the general election, but all of us have met in our own circles the most surprising and unexpected Trump supporters, who cite no resonant political affinity with Trump other than shared furor over politically correct and censored speech, and the need for someone  —   almost anyone will do  —   to throw a wrecking ball through the politically correct glass houses of our society. No one knows how many of his supporters are silent, embarrassed to state publicly their support for one so uncouth no one knows what he may say or do on any given day  —   or the full effect of his outbursts  —   and no one quite appreciates that what appears outlandish to elites may appear genuine and earthy to others. Today experts laugh that a supposedly buffoonish Sarah Palin sank the otherwise sober and judicious McCain campaign but, in truth, polls at the times suggested that she was either not a factor or perhaps a plus to the ticket. In any case, the McCain —  Palin ticket was ahead of Obama until the Wall Street meltdown in September of 2008. Elites who said they knew no one who liked Palin in truth must have known very few Americans at all. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  The Media. Trump sailed to primary victories on a Machiavellian wave of media manipulation he had   pull, and at very little cost could leverage network attention  —   either on the premise that his buffoonery was a ratings plus, or because leftist flutists were willing to play for Trump in the hopes of leading Republican lemmings over the cliff. What is certain is that in the general election, the media will revert to form and become an institutionalized extension of the Clinton campaign Trump mania will no longer be useful to either their profits or their political objectives. Then we will see just how adroit Trump is as a media showman, when journalists are out to get him rather than to be entertained by him. Moreover, the    free publicity of early 2016 may have left the Trump organization complacent, expecting that it could glide to a   victory without massive fundraising and a serious ground game. That delusion might mean that Trump’s people will never quite catch up with Hillary’s money and     machine.

Will the health of the    Clinton and the nearly    Trump hold up under the grueling next five months of summer and autumn campaigning? Actuarial tables suggest that both would likely be able to finish out two terms, but the point is not necessarily longevity, but robustness. In other words, which of the two elderly candidates  —   in combined age, they are the oldest nominees in   history  —   will be the more likely to crisscross the country and put in   days? While Trump  —   at about the same age as the     Bill Clinton  —   does not seem to be a model of fitness, so far he exhibits an animal energy lacking in Hillary. Obama  —   on the Back Nine or on the Stump? As long as Barack Obama keeps out of sight, and things run on autopilot, half the country likes the abstract idea that he is president. In contrast, when he campaigns, demagogues, slurs, and expresses his inner narcissism, his ratings dip to near 40 percent. If he slams Trump from abroad, delivers another stuttering, incoherent rant against Trump, offers the Clintons more snarky backhanded compliments (Hillary is “likeable enough”) or issues more     executive orders, he will prove by November more a negative than a plus. For now, Hillary is flummoxed about how to win his allegiance (both political and legal) without having to defend a disastrous $11 trillion in additional debt, a mess overseas (in which, to be sure, she had a hand) Obamacare, and a sluggish economy of slow growth and record      —   or what Bill Clinton summed up succinctly as the “awful legacy of the last eight years. ” Obama could help Hillary best by giving a   endorsement and then staying on the golf course until November. If, instead, Obama goes on the stump for her, it may be counterproductive  —   and in some subliminal fashion therefore preferable for the egocentric Obama. RELATED: The Revenge of Tribalism, The News. If Putin stays within his boundaries, if the Chinese and North Koreans refrain from doing something stupid, if Iran curbs its braggadocio and does not hijack another American boat, if ISIS fails to pull off another major terrorist operation, and if the economy continues to stagger along, then the superficial calm works to Hillary’s advantage. But if in the next five months we have a foreign crisis or an economic slowdown, then Hillary in relation to Obama replays the role of McCain in relation to Bush in 2008  —   but squared, given Hillary’s tenure in the Obama administration. Obama, with massive defense cuts,    and reset diplomacy, and treating allies as neutrals and enemies as friends, has endangered America abroad and weakened it at home. The tab is coming due, but whether it will arrive before November is unclear. Certainly, the latest tragedy of the the mass shooting in Florida suggests that having a president and a   president who, for politically correct reasons, cannot utter the phrase “radical Islam” or “Islamic terrorism” in the context of Muslims who kill innocents out of religious zeal and hatred is not a sustainable proposition.

We do not quite know to what the degree the public is sick of the New York —  Washington rot, encompassing Obama’s petty identity politics, the Clintons’ grifter enterprises, the sanctimonious and ossified Republican establishment, the incestuous network of cable and media pundits, and the general sense that our elites of both parties never expect the consequences of their own ideologies to apply to themselves. The general repugnance for traditional politicians,   wizards, and Wall Street profiteers fueled both Sanders and Trump, despite the contradictions of their own relationships with big money, big politics, and big media. But as Sanders drops out of the race, Trump alone will remain the more populist and   of the final two candidates. The idea of socialist Sanders supporters flocking to Trump should seem wholly lunatic. But the same youthful incoherence that drew the naïve to Sanders might to some degree draw them now to Trump, on the basis that he dislikes Hillary, Inc. even more than did Sanders. The wonder (to paraphrase Dr. Johnson on female preachers and dancing dogs) is not that Trump might capture a fair number of Sanders voters, but that he could capture any at all. Final thoughts: If Trump were to win, the   establishment would be mostly discredited and the party would move even further to the Left, in McGovern 1972 fashion, while its Republican establishment counterpart would wander in a    wilderness. More 2016 It’s Time to Move On from the 2016 ElectionHillary Blames America FirstHillary Says Voter Suppression Cost Her the ElectionIf Hillary prevails, we will likely see a   continuum of fundamental change, the likes of which have not been seen since the 20 years between 1933 and 1952  —   though Obama has none of the redeeming virtues of FDR on foreign policy, nor Hillary those of Truman. Meanwhile the   among Republicans that would follow a Clinton victory (with one wing arguing that   sabotaged Trump and the other wing saying it was Neanderthals who nominated him) might well destroy the party, given that its class fissures, first revealed in the defections to the 1992 and 1996 Perot campaigns, have now become an abyss. In the meantime, perhaps #NeverTrumpers should adopt one rule for the sake of party unity: For each of their attacks on the Republican nominee, vow to match it with one attack on the Democratic nominee. And for each conservative guest editorialist in the New York Times or Washington Post deploring what the Republicans have done, perhaps a #NeverHillary liberal might write a commensurate critical   about Clinton in The Weekly Standard or National Review.  —   NRO contributor Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.

"5 things to know for your New Day -- Thursday, June 11.  (CNN) Those escaped convicts may be headed to Vermont. An American dies fighting ISIS in Syria. And maybe one day soon, you can get the Internet from outer space. It’s Thursday, and here are five things to know for your New Day.    NEW YORK PRISON ESCAPE, Search continues: Are the New York escapees headed to Vermont? Authorities believe they could be, hoping to evade the intense manhunt for them that’s covered upstate New York. Vermont police vessels and state troopers will conduct patrols on Lake Champlain, which sits on the New   border, and New York state troopers will be allowed into Vermont if needed. The search for Richard Matt and David Sweat now involves more than 400 officers.   ISIS, American killed: Keith Broomfield, an American citizen, was killed in Syria fighting ISIS. Broomfield was fighting alongside the Kurds. Not much more is known at this time about him, including how he died, how long he had been in the region as a fighter and just how he became a fighter.   D. C. MANSION KILLINGS, More evidence: We knew the slayings last month of a prominent Washington family and their housekeeper were gruesome, and newly unsealed court documents    a search warrant and accompanying affidavit    illustrate just how bad it was. A bloody baseball bat was found in the room where three of the bodies were found. Some of the victims suffered trauma to the head   lacerations to the throat and head.    BALTIMORE  Police talk: The city is suffering through one of the most violent periods in its history, and a pair of cops admit the police are standing by and letting it happen. The officers, who talked to CNN anonymously, said police feel abandoned by the city’s leadership and are afraid of being charged criminally for simply doing their jobs. So they are no longer aggressively pursuing the bad guys. After the interview aired, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts urged them to think of the citizens and ”remember why you do this job.”     INTERNET, Web wonder: Want to get the Internet from space? It’s a step closer to reality, now that Elon Musk has asked the government for permission to start testing his idea for getting Web service from beyond the clouds. Musk will launch eight prototype satellites, each quipped with antennas that will send Internet signals back to Earth. The FCC is reviewing the proposal Musk would like to start testing next year.",-1.0
"Clinton, Trump bring infrastructure hopes to White House | TheHill. Whether it’s Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE or Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE in the White House next year, one thing is certain: Infrastructure spending is going to be on the agenda.  Transportation advocates say they are more encouraged than ever, as both candidates have called for making massive investments in fixing the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges. But whether their plans can muster enough support in Congress — which will require coming up with a suitable, long-term funding solution — is far less clear. “There’s very strong support in the realization that infrastructure is a federal responsibility,” said Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Fla.), chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on transportation. “But here’s the sticking point, the 800-pound gorilla: How do you pay for it?”  Clinton’s plan Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has made investments in the nation’s infrastructure a cornerstone of her job-creation plan and promised to put forth a proposal within her first 100 days in office. “Sec. Clinton has been unequivocal: She believes that these investments in our future simply cannot wait,” a spokesperson for Clinton’s campaign said in a statement. “She has vowed to work tirelessly to break through any Washington gridlock she faces to fulfill this promise.” Talk like that from Clinton has spurred optimism among transportation advocates. “She’s committed to make it a 100 day priority, which is very unusual,” said Ed Wytkind, president of the Transportation Trades Department. “We’ve never seen that by a candidate for president.” The former first lady’s sweeping, five-year plan includes $250 billion in direct spending on new and improved infrastructure. It also emphasizes cutting the regulatory red tape that slows the construction of new projects and reauthorizes a Build America Bonds program to stimulate billions of additional dollars in infrastructure investments.  During a speech near Detroit this summer, Clinton vowed to work with Congress to advance the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. “We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports,” Clinton said. “We are way overdue for this, my friends. We are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents.”   Infrastructure bank Clinton’s vision also includes a $25 billion national infrastructure bank “to get private funds off the sidelines.” The idea has long been touted by Democrats, but has yet to get off the ground. The bank would provide low-interest loans and other financial assistance to encourage investors to back national infrastructure projects. Clinton maintains that seed funding for the bank could spur more than $250 billion in spending on infrastructure projects throughout the country, as well as create higher paying jobs. “What she’s proposing is a very realistic number,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “We could very efficiently spend an extra $275 billion.” Clinton’s plan would be paid for through business tax reform. Although she has been vague on details, Democrats and Republicans have long been split on how to reform the business tax code, making any tax overhaul a heavy lift in Congress. “She’s talking about doing it in the context if tax reform, but I’m sure she would be open to other ideas,” DeFazio said. Some lawmakers who were critical of President Obama’s economic stimulus package are likely to be wary of another major infrastructure proposal that promises to create jobs. “A lot of folks, including myself, held out great, great hope,” said Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.), a former chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “He talked about high-speed rail connecting the cities. And they took the money and squandered it.” Obama made transportation projects a focus of his stimulus plan, which devoted $105 billion to infrastructure, partly in the form of competitive grants. But critics say the “shovel-ready” projects took too long to get off the ground, and they question whether the spending created as many jobs as promised.   Trump’s plan If Clinton’s infrastructure proposal faces an uphill battle, however, then Trump’s may need to climb a mountain. The Republican nominee has long talked about the need to fix the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and has often lamented that the country’s “third-world” airports and transit systems are falling behind those in countries like China. Trump said last month at the Detroit Economic Club that he will “build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports.” The real estate mogul has vowed to double Clinton’s $275 billion proposal, bringing his plan to over a half-trillion dollars.  “I could put my faith in a businessman who has proven himself on projects,” Mica said.  But Trump has yet to lay out a specific policy proposal. He has only said that he would raise money for transportation projects through a fund, sold as infrastructure bonds, and that “people, investors and citizens” would put money into the fund. “You do need to pay bonds back,” DeFazio said. “Infrastructure bonds aren’t free.” The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.  Trump backs borrowing Trump has indicated in the past that he supports borrowing and spending in order to boost economic growth, which is a major break from traditional Republican principles that could spur fierce opposition from within his own party. “The good news is that the two leading presidential candidates seem to agree with each other (and with America’s business community) about the importance of investing in infrastructure,” Laura Bonavita, director of communications and strategy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent blog post. “Problem is, we haven’t heard much about their plans to actually pay for these critical investments. American business leaders want to ensure that any infrastructure plan would include a long-term sustainable funding source to meet our country’s future investment needs. “ Washington lawmakers have struggled to produce long-term funding solutions for the Highway Trust Fund. The pot of money supports transportation and infrastructures projects throughout the country and is financed by the federal gas tax, which hasn’t been raised in over 20 years. A recently enacted five-year surface transportation bill was financed by a series of budgetary gimmicks, underscoring the difficulties of coming up with a way to pay for something even with widespread, bipartisan support. Even Speaker Paul RyanPaul  Davis RyanEmbattled Juul seeks allies in Washington Ex-Parkland students criticize Kellyanne Conway Latina leaders: 'It's a women's world more than anything' MORE (R-Wis.) cast some doubt on whether there was hope for major infrastructure legislation anytime soon, because Congress passed a highway bill last December. “We passed the biggest highway bill, the long-term highway bill, for the first time since the 1990s just a few months ago,” Ryan said in an address to the Economic Club of New York. “So that’s already in place, and 10 percent above baseline spending on mass transit and highways.” Still, infrastructure advocates remain hopeful that the issue has moved up on the public’s radar this election cycle, which could ultimately step up pressure on Congress — and give them some political cover — to help the next administration get something done. “Either Clinton or Trump would emphasize infrastructure” in office, said Ed Rendel, a Clinton surrogate and former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania. “Both candidates have made a lot of their pitch about economic development, and the best way to create well-paying jobs is infrastructure.” View the discussion thread.

"FULL SPEECH: Theresa May Hails Globalism, Calls for Action on Climate Change. British Prime Minister Theresa May used her speech in Philadelphia today to warn over climate change, call Islam a religion of peace, and hail globalist institutions such as the World Bank and United Nations. [The full text of the speech follows:     Majority Leader McConnell, Mr Speaker, Distinguished Members of the Senate and Representatives of the House. I would like to thank Congress and the Congressional Institute for the invitation to be here today. The opportunity to visit the United States is always special. And to be invited to be the first serving Head of Government to address this important conference is an honour indeed. I defy any person to travel to this great country at any time and not to be inspired by its promise and its example. For more than two centuries, the very idea of America  —   drawn from history and given written form in a small hall not far from here  —   has lit up the world. That idea  —   that all are created equal and that all are born free  —   has never been surpassed in the long history of political thought. And it is here  —   on the streets and in the halls of this great city of Philadelphia  —   that the founding fathers first set it down, that the textbook of freedom was written, and that this great nation that grew “from sea to shining sea” was born. Since that day, it has been America’s destiny to bear the leadership of the free world and to carry that heavy responsibility on its shoulders. But my country, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, has been proud to share that burden and to walk alongside you at every stage. For the past century, Britain and America  —   and the unique and special relationship that exists between us  —   have taken the idea conceived by those “     ordinary citizens” as President Reagan called them, forward. And because we have done so, time and again it is the relationship between us that has defined the modern world. One hundred years ago this April, it was your intervention in the First World War that helped Britain, France, our friends in the Commonwealth and other allies to maintain freedom in Europe. A little more than   years ago, you responded to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour by joining Britain in the Second World War and defeating fascism not just in the Pacific but in Africa and Europe too. And later, in the aftermath of these wars, our two countries led the West through the Cold War, confronting communism and ultimately defeating it not just through military might, but by winning the war of ideas. And by proving that open, liberal, democratic societies will always defeat those that are closed, coercive and cruel. But the leadership provided by our two countries through the Special Relationship has done more than win wars and overcome adversity. It made the modern world. The institutions upon which that world relies were so often conceived or inspired by our two nations working together. The United Nations  —   in need of reform, but vital still  —   has its foundations in the Special Relationship, from the original Declaration of St James’ Palace to the Declaration by United Nations, signed in Washington, and drafted themselves by Winston Churchill and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund, born in the   world at Bretton Woods, were conceived by our two nations working together. And NATO  —   the cornerstone of the West’s defence  —   was established on the bonds of trust and mutual interests that exist between us. Some of these organisations are in need of reform and renewal to make them relevant to our needs today. But we should be proud of the role our two nations  —   working in partnership  —   played in bringing them into being, and in bringing peace and prosperity to billions of people as a result. Because it is through our actions over many years, working together to defeat evil or to open up the world, that we have been able to fulfil the promise of those who first spoke of the special nature of the relationship between us. The promise of freedom, liberty and the rights of man. “We must never cease” Churchill said, “to proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the   world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence”. So it is my honour and my privilege to stand before you today in this great city of Philadelphia to proclaim them again, to join hands as we pick up that mantle of leadership once more, to renew our Special Relationship and to recommit ourselves to the responsibility of leadership in the modern world. CHANGE IN AMERICA, And it is my honour and privilege to do so at this time, as dawn breaks on a new era of American renewal. For I speak to you not just as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but as a fellow Conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your Party. The value of liberty. The dignity of work. The principles of nationhood, family, economic prudence, patriotism  —   and putting power in the hands of the people. Principles instilled in me from a young age. Principles that my parents taught me in the vicarage in Southern England in which I was raised. I know that it is these principles that you have put at the heart of your plan for government. And your victory in these elections gives you the opportunity to put them at the heart of this new era of American renewal too. President Trump’s victory  —   achieved in defiance of all the pundits and the polls  —   and rooted not in the corridors of Washington, but in the hopes and aspirations of working men and women across this land. Your Party’s victory in both the Congress and the Senate where you swept all before you, secured with great effort, and achieved with an important message of national renewal. And because of this  —   because of what you have done together, because of that great victory you have won  —   America can be stronger, greater, and more confident in the years ahead. CHANGE IN BRITAIN, And a newly emboldened, confident America is good for the world. An America that is strong and prosperous at home is a nation that can lead abroad. But you cannot  —   and should not  —   do so alone. You have said that it is time for others to step up. And I agree. Sovereign countries cannot outsource their security and prosperity to America. And they should not undermine the alliances that keep us strong by failing to step up and play their part. This is something Britain has always understood. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20  —   other than yours  —   to meet its commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and to invest 20% of that in upgrading equipment. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20 to spend 0. 7% of gross national income on overseas development. It is why my first act as Prime Minister last year was to lead the debate in Parliament that ensured the renewal of Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent. And it is why the Government I lead will increase spending on defence in every year of this Parliament. It is why Britain is a leading member  —   alongside the United States  —   of the coalition working successfully to defeat Daesh why we have agreed to send 800 troops to Estonia and Poland as part of NATO’s forward presence in eastern Europe why we are increasing our troop contribution to NATO’s Resolute Support mission that defends the Afghan government from terrorism and it is why we are reinforcing our commitment to peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, South Sudan and Somalia. And it is why Britain is leading the way in pioneering international efforts to crack down on modern slavery  —   one of the great scourges of our world  —   wherever it is found. I hope you will join us in that cause  —   and I commend Senator Corker in particular for his work in this field. It is good to see him here today. As Americans know, the United Kingdom is by instinct and history a great, global nation that recognises its responsibilities to the world. And as we end our membership of the European Union  —   as the British people voted with determination and quiet resolve to do last year  —   we have the opportunity to reassert our belief in a confident, sovereign and Global Britain, ready to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike. We will build a new partnership with our friends in Europe. We are not turning our back on them, or on the interests and the values that we share. It remains overwhelmingly in our interests  —   and in those of the wider world  —   that the EU should succeed. And for as long as we remain members we will continue to play our full part, just as we will continue to cooperate on security, foreign policy and trade once we have left. But we have chosen a different future for our country. A future that sees us restore our parliamentary sovereignty and national   and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit. A future that sees us take back control of the things that matter to us  —   things like our national borders and immigration policy, and the way we decide and interpret our own laws  —   so that we are able to shape a better, more prosperous future for the working men and women of Britain. A future that sees us step up with confidence to a new, even more internationalist role, where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies, champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world, and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business, free markets and free trade anywhere around the globe. This is a vision of a future that my country can unite around  —   and that I hope your country, as our closest friend and ally, can welcome and support. A RENEWED SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, So as we rediscover our confidence together  —   as you renew your nation just as we renew ours  —   we have the opportunity  —   indeed the responsibility  —   to renew the Special Relationship for this new age. We have the opportunity to lead, together, again. Because the world is passing through a period of change  —   and in response to that change we can either be passive bystanders, or we can take the opportunity once more to lead. And to lead together. I believe it is in our national interest to do so. Because the world is increasingly marked by instability and threats that threaten to undermine our way of life and the very things that we hold dear. The end of the Cold War did not give rise to a New World Order. It did not herald the End of History. It did not lead to a new age of peace, prosperity and predictability in world affairs. For some  —   the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe in particular  —   it brought new freedom. But across the world, ancient ethnic, religious and national rivalries  —   rivalries that had been frozen through the decades of the Cold War  —   returned. New enemies of the West and our values  —   in particular in the form of Radical Islamists  —   have emerged. And countries with little tradition of democracy, liberty and human rights  —   notably China and Russia  —   have grown more assertive in world affairs. The rise of the Asian economies  —   China yes, but democratic allies like India too  —   is hugely welcome. Billions are being lifted out of poverty and new markets for our industries are opening up. But these events  —   coming as they have at the same time as the financial crisis and its fall out, as well as a loss of confidence in the West following   the military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and sporadic terrorist attacks  —   have led many to fear that, in this century, we will experience the eclipse of the West. But there is nothing inevitable about that. Other countries may grow stronger. Big, populous countries may grow richer. And as they do so, they may start to embrace more fully our values of democracy and liberty. But even if they do not, our interests will remain. Our values will endure. And the need to defend them and project them will be as important as ever. So we  —   our two countries together  —   have a joint responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world. It is in our interests  —   those of Britain and America together  —   to stand strong together to defend our values, our interests and the very ideas in which we believe. This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene. We must be strong, smart and  . And we must demonstrate the resolve necessary to stand up for our interests. And whether it is the security of Israel in the Middle East or Estonia in the Baltic states, we must always stand up for our friends and allies in democratic countries that find themselves in tough neighbourhoods too. We each have different political traditions. We will sometimes pursue different domestic policies. And there may be occasions on which we disagree. But the common values and interests that bring us together are hugely powerful. And  —   as your foremost friend and ally  —   we support many of the priorities your government has laid out for America’s engagement with the world. It is why I join you in your determination to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamic extremism that inspires them and many others terrorist groups in the world today. It is in both of our national interests to do so. This will require us to use the intelligence provided by the finest security agencies in the world. And it will require the use of military might. But it also demands a wider effort. Because one of the lessons of fighting terrorism in the last 15 years or so is yes, killing terrorists can save innocent lives. But until we kill the idea that drives them, the ideology, we will always have to live with this threat. And as they are defeated on the ground, the terrorists are exploiting the internet and social media to spread this ideology that is preying on vulnerable citizens in our own countries, inspiring them to commit acts of terror in our own cities. That is why the UK has led the world in developing a strategy for preventing violent extremism, and why the British and American governments are working together to take on and defeat the ideology of Islamist Extremism. I look forward to working with the President and his Administration to step up our efforts still further in order to defeat this evil ideology. But of course, we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology, and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents  —   including millions of our own citizens and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology’s terror. And nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism, starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence. Yet ultimately to defeat Daesh, we must employ all of the diplomatic means at our disposal. That means working internationally to secure a political solution in Syria and challenging the alliance between the Syrian regime and its backers in Tehran. When it comes to Russia, as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who  —   during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev  —   used to abide by the adage “trust but verify”. With President Putin, my advice is to “engage but beware”. There is nothing inevitable about conflict between Russia and the West. And nothing unavoidable about retreating to the days of the Cold War. But we should engage with Russia from a position of strength. And we should build the relationships, systems and processes that make cooperation more likely than conflict  —   and that, particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea, give assurance to Russia’s neighbouring states that their security is not in question. We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin’s claim that it is now in his sphere of influence. And progress on this issue would also help to secure another of this nation’s priorities  —   to reduce Iran’s malign influence in the Middle East. This is a priority for the UK too as we support our allies in the Gulf States to push back against Iran’s aggressive efforts to build an arc of influence from Tehran through to the Mediterranean. The nuclear deal with Iran was controversial. But it has neutralised the possibility of the Iranians acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade. It has seen Iran remove 13, 000 centrifuges together with associated infrastructure and eliminate its stock of 20% enriched uranium. That was vitally important for regional security. But the agreement must now be very carefully and rigorously policed  —   and any breaches should be dealt with firmly and immediately. STRONG INSTITUTIONS AND NATIONS, To deal with the threats of the modern world, we need to rebuild confidence in the institutions upon which we all rely. In part that means multinational institutions. Because we know that so many of the threats we face today  —   global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented mass movements of people  —   do not respect national borders. So we must turn towards those multinational institutions like the UN and NATO that encourage international cooperation and partnership. But those multinational institutions need to work for the countries that formed them, and to serve the needs and interests of the people of those nations. They have no democratic mandate of their own. So I share your reform agenda and believe that, by working together, we can make those institutions more relevant and purposeful than they are today. I call on others, therefore, to join us in that effort and to ensure they step up and contribute as they should. That is why I have encouraged Antonio Guterres, the new UN Secretary General, to pursue an ambitious reform programme, focusing the United Nations on its core functions of peacekeeping, conflict prevention and resolution. And it is why I have already raised with my fellow European leaders the need to deliver on their commitments to spend 2% of their GDP on defence  —   and 20% of their defence budgets on equipment. It is also why I have already raised with Jens Stoltenberg  —   the Secretary General of NATO  —   the need to make sure the Alliance is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyber warfare, as it is to fight more conventional forms of war. America’s leadership role in NATO  —   supported by Britain  —   must be the central element around which the Alliance is built. But alongside this continued commitment, I am also clear that EU nations must similarly step up to ensure this institution that provides the cornerstone of the West’s defence continues to be as effective as it can be. Yet the most important institution is  —   and should always be  —   the nation state. Strong nations form strong institutions. And they form the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that bring stability to our world. Nations, accountable to their populations  —   “deriving” as the Declaration of Independence puts it “their just powers from the consent of the governed”  —   can choose to join international organisations, or not. They can choose to cooperate with others, or not. Choose to trade with others, or not. Which is why if the countries of the European Union wish to integrate further, my view is that they should be free to do so. Because that is what they choose. But Britain  —   as a sovereign nation with the same values but a different political and cultural history  —   has chosen to take a different path. Because our history and culture is profoundly internationalist. We are a European country  —   and proud of our shared European heritage  —   but we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We have ties of family, kinship and history to countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and countries across Africa, the Pacific and Caribbean. And of course, we have ties of kinship, language and culture to these United States too. As Churchill put it, we “speak the same language, kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals”. And, today, increasingly we have strong economic, commercial, defence and political relationships as well. So I am delighted that the new Administration has made a trade agreement between our countries one of its earliest priorities. A new trade deal between Britain and America must work for both sides and serve both of our national interests. It must help to grow our respective economies and to provide the     jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK. And it must work for those who have too often felt left behind by the forces of globalisation. People, often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own, who feel that the global system of free markets and free trade is simply not working for them in its current form. Such a deal  —   allied to the reforms we are making to our own economy to ensure wealth and opportunity is spread across our land  —   can demonstrate to those who feel locked out and left behind that free markets, free economies and free trade can deliver the brighter future they need. And it can maintain  —   indeed it can build  —   support for the   international system on which the stability of our world continues to rely. The UK is already America’s fifth largest export destination, while your markets account for almost a fifth of global exports from our shores. Exports to the UK from this State of Pennsylvania alone account for more than $2 billion a year. The UK is the largest market in the EU  —   and the third largest market in the world  —   for exporters here. America is the largest single destination for UK outward investment and the single largest investor in the UK. And your companies are investing or expanding in the UK at a rate of more than ten projects a week. British companies employ people in every US state from Texas to Vermont. And the   Defence relationship is the broadest, deepest and most advanced of any two countries, sharing military hardware and expertise. And of course, we have recently invested in the new   strike aircraft for our new aircraft carriers that will secure our naval presence  —   and increase our ability to project our power around the world  —   for years to come. Because of these strong economic and commercial links  —   and our shared history and the strength of our relationship  —   I look forward to pursuing talks with the new Administration about a new   Free Trade Agreement in the coming months. It will take detailed work, but we welcome your openness to those discussions and hope we can make progress so that the new, Global Britain that emerges after Brexit is even better equipped to take its place confidently in the world. CONCLUSION, Such an agreement would see us taking that next step in the special relationship that exists between us. Cementing and affirming one of the greatest forces for progress this world has ever known. Seventy years ago in 1946, Churchill proposed a new phase in this relationship  —   to win a Cold War that many had not even realised had started. He described how an iron curtain had fallen from the Baltic to the Adriatic, covering all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia and Bucharest. Today those great cities  —   homes of great culture and heritage  —   live in freedom and peace. And they do so because of the leadership of Britain and America, and of Mrs Thatcher and President Reagan. They do so  —   ultimately  —   because our ideas will always prevail. And they do so because, when the world demands leadership, it is this alliance of values and interests  —   this Special Relationship between two countries  —   that, to borrow the words of another great American statesman, enters the arena, with our faces marred by dust and sweat and blood, to strive valiantly and know the triumph of high achievement. As we renew the promise of our nations to make them stronger at home  —   in the words of President Reagan as the “sleeping giant stirs”  —   so let us renew the relationship that can lead the world towards the promise of freedom and prosperity marked out in parchment by those ordinary citizens 240 years ago. So that we may not be counted with the “cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat” but with those who “strive to do the deeds” that will lead us to a better world. That better future is within reach. Together, we can build it.",1.0
"Sessions well-documented praise of Rosa Parks belies ’racist’ claims. Sessions, 69, who advised Trump on immigration during the campaign, was U. S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama from 1981 to 1993 before being elected to the U. S. Senate in 1996. He was   to a fourth term in 2014 and is known for his hardline stance on illegal immigration in particular. However, the pick was immediately blasted by opponents of Trump, who condemned Sessions as a backwards bigot who would harm the causes of immigrants and  . TRUMP TAPS LOYALISTS FOR CABINET PICKS, “If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man,” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez,  . in a fiery statement Friday. “Senator Sessions’ record suggests that he will carry on an old, ugly legacy in this country’s history when civil rights for   women and minorities were not regarded as core American values,” the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said in a statement. See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → Critics revisited his failed 1986 nomination to a federal judgeship, which was shut down by the Senate Judiciary Committee after it heard testimony that Sessions had made racist remarks and called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) “ ” and “ . ” His failed prosecution of three civil rights workers on a tenuous case of voter fraud was also raised as a disqualifying issue. Sessions was also accused of calling an   lawyer “boy” and was also alleged to have said Ku Klux Klan members were “okay,” until he ”learned they smoked marijuana. ” Sessions said the comment was made in jest. Many of Sessions’   critics have used the controversy to brand Sessions as a racist, with Gutierrez saying Sessions ran for the Senate “because he was deemed by the Senate Judiciary Committee as too racist to serve as a federal judge. ” “Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions’ nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism no negotiation with hate,” added Sen. Elizabeth Warren,  .  Yet, the narrative of Sessions as an unapologetic racist is complicated somewhat by his repeated advocacy for black civil rights hero Rosa Parks. In 1999, Sessions called successfully for the Alabama native to be given the Congressional gold medal. In doing so, Sessions made a passionate call for lawmakers to renew the principle of equality under the law. “As legislators, we should work to strengthen the appreciation for this fundamental governing principle by recognizing those who make extraordinary contributions towards ensuring that all American citizens have the opportunity, regardless of their race, sex, creed, or national origin, to enjoy in the freedoms that this country has to offer,” Sessions said, before calling Parks a “living embodiment of this principle. ” A year later, Sessions attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that gave $1 million to Alabama for the Rosa Parks Library, Museum and Learning Center at Troy State University Montgomery Campus as a way of memorializing the Montgomery Bus Boycott, for which Parks’ protest was the impetus. In 2005, after Parks’ death, Sessions gave a passionate tribute to her on the floor of the Senate, saying “history will remember Rosa Parks for shaking America’s conscience and changing the course of our Nation for the better. ” In 2012, Sessions introduced a resolution to the Senate floor, along with Michigan Democratic senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, to observe the 100th anniversary of Parks’ birth. “Her courage ignited major changes in our nation and lead a revolution in race relations. Mrs. Parks will always be remembered as a courageous individual, who confronted injustice   and, in so doing, changed our nation. Her legacy continues to endure,” Sessions said.   The Trump transition team, responding to the backlash against Sessions, noted Friday both Sessions’ advocacy of Parks, as well as his record as a senator and U. S. attorney in advancing civil rights. “You know, when Senator Sessions was U. S. attorney, he filed a number of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama and he also voted in favor of the   extension of the Civil Rights Act,” communications director Jason Miller said in a conference call. “He also voted to confirm Attorney General Eric Holder and even spearheaded the effort toward giving the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. ”  “So we feel very confident that Senator Sessions has the background and the support to receive confirmation,” Miller said.

"Discontent in Malay heartland may spell trouble for PM Najib.  The Malaysian plantation district of Sungkai has become an initial   and unlikely   battleground for an election that embattled Prime Minister Najib Razak is expected to call this year.  Sungkai is home to ethnic Malays who work for the national palm plantation operator, Federal Land Development Authority (Felda). Known as ”Felda settlers” they have long been among the beneficiaries of government affirmative action program for Malays, who form the majority of the population. The Felda settlers have been a rock solid vote bank for Najib’s ruling coalition, even as urban Malays have poured into the opposition camp in recent years, alienated by a series of political scandals.  Najib’s coalition lost the popular vote in the last general election in 2013, but still won a majority of seats in Malaysia’s gerrymandered constituencies. Malaysia’s opposition is hoping the settlers could be the next to defect, which was why opposition lawmaker Rafizi Ramli on Sunday night was in Sungkai, a former mining town that now mainly relies on palm oil and rubber planting. The settlers have been angered by Felda’s decision to purchase a 37 percent stake in Indonesian palm oil firm PT Eagle High Plantations for $505 million, more than a 100 percent premium based on its closing share price on Wednesday. FELDA’S DEBTS Eagle High is owned by one of Indonesia’s richest men, Peter Sondakh, who has done a number of deals in Malaysia and is a longtime friend of Najib. Najib’s office did not respond to requests for comment about the deal. Sondakh has not publicly commented about the deal in Jakarta. Just six months ago, Najib’s United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party secured a sweeping victory in a   in a neighboring constituency in northern Perak state.  But on Sunday night, more than 300 people gathered on the lawn of a Sungkai resident under a dank tropical night to hear opposition lawmaker Rafizi Ramli tell the cheering crowd: ”We will change our prime minister and our government.”  ”Felda’s debts are growing . .. and the government will use the settlers money to pay it off,” said Rafizi, a    lawmaker from People’s Justice Party (PKR). ”If we don’t stop this, the debt will be shouldered by our future generations.” Felda has said the deal will not impact its existing commitments and programs to improve the   of the settlers. Felda itself is planning a series of roadshows to convince settlers in its plantation areas of the deal’s benefits. QUARTER OF PARLIAMENT  Felda settlers are the majority voters in at least 54 of the 222 seats in the national parliament, and has helped bring the   Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition to power in every election since independence in 1957. Even the opposition’s attempt to highlight a   dollar alleged   scandal at state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) that erupted in 2015 did not resonate with rural voters. The Felda issue, however, affects them directly. ”All this while, UMNO has won the elections because there are 54 parliamentary seats in the Felda (settlers) areas. Now I am sure the sentiment has changed,” said Mazlan Aliman, president of the National Felda Settlers’ Children Society (ANAK). He estimates that over half of his association members and their families will vote for the opposition party if the Eagle High deal goes through.    ”If this happens, (Barisan Nasional) will lose in the upcoming elections,” Mazlan said. Najib has to call elections by 2018, but a government source told Reuters he may do it earlier, possibly in the second half of this year.  ELECTION HEADWINDS The prime minister is heading into the next election already saddled with the scandal around 1MDB, which has been investigated in a   countries for money laundering. His government said nearly $700 million of 1MDB money that wound up in Najib’s personal bank account came from an unnamed Saudi. Yet Najib, who has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, retains a tight grip on UMNO by commanding a vast patronage system that spreads the largesse among ordinary Malays as well as party apparatchiks. He is wielding sticks along with the carrots: Anwar Ibrahim, the charismatic opposition leader, remains in jail on sodomy charges, activists and politicians have been charged with sedition, critical news websites have been closed. Rafizi, the lawmaker who spoke at the Sungkai rally, is himself on bail pending an appeal after he was sentenced to 18 months in jail for leaking a confidential 1MDB document. But the prime minister is fighting economic headwinds. Although Malaysia’s GDP is expected to grow this year, the ringgit currency has fallen by more than a quarter over the past two years, and prices have risen after state subsidies were slashed and a national goods and services (GST) tax launched. All that is being felt in rural Malay heartlands such as Sungkai, and is contributing to the sour faces over the   High deal. ”Despite a sustained campaign by political opponents to undermine Malaysia’s economy, the IMF and World Bank state that it remains on track to grow at 4. 5 percent and 4. 3 percent respectively,” a Malaysian government spokesman said. Economists forecast 2016 growth will be 4. 2 percent. FELDA’S FALLEN FORTUNES Felda, created by Najib’s father and Malaysia’s second prime minister, resettled and employed the rural poor in the palm industry. It helped lead Malaysia to become one of the world’s two largest producers of palm oil, along with Indonesia. The settlers leased government land for palm cultivation and many also own shares in Felda Global Ventures (FGV) a unit of Felda that raised over $3 billion in a listing in 2012. But Felda’s fortunes have slumped in recent years   its shares fell by over 60 percent since its IPO. The shares plunged  another 5 percent on Dec. 23, when the Eagle High deal was announced. ”This is a waste of money,” said Khalili Kasim, a    settler, saying Felda should be providing housing loans, or educational aid instead of putting money into Eagle High. ”Land owners should be rich, but why are some of us still struggling and living under the poverty line?” Khalili said. But the opposition will be fighting an uphill battle to secure the votes of Felda settlers, who have long been loyal UMNO supporters. ”In the   to the elections, if they (UMNO) can develop measures that can persuade the voters . .. then they can still mitigate the concerns arising from the purchase of Eagle High,” said Ibrahim Suffian, director of independent opinion polling firm Merdeka Center. ”But this is not a done deal; it is a developing story.”  (Editing by Praveen Menon and Bill Tarrant) DUBAI Qatar faces further isolation and possible expulsion from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) if its response to a list of demands made nearly two weeks ago is not satisfactory,   Gulf media said on Wednesday.

"Risk-on mood, signs from French left prod euro higher.  The euro recovered some ground against the dollar on Monday after weekend talks aimed at finding a leftist unity candidate for France’s presidential election showed little sign of progress. News that Socialist Benoit Hamon and   rival   Melanchon were discussing cooperation in their bid for the presidency weakened the euro and supported the yen on Friday. Investors believe such a   could either backfire and propel     candidate Marine Le Pen into the Elysee palace or succeed and land France with a   president pursuing   economic policies.  But policy proposals outlined by Melanchon on Sunday underscored the gap he would have to bridge with Hamon to find a common platform for the April and May polls also helped boost the euro. ”If they did unite then any outcome would be a bad outcome from the market’s point of view,” said Richard Benson,   of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.  ”It was what caused the   move on Friday, although the interesting thing was it seemed to play out more on   than the euro. In general the market does seem very nervous.” The common currency rose around 0. 1 percent and 0. 3 percent respectively against the dollar and yen in early trade in Europe   EURJPY= while the dollar also rose 0. 1 percent to 113. 08 yen, having given back some of its overnight gains.  The start of 2017 on currency markets has been dominated by disappointment with U. S. President Donald Trump’s early fiscal and tax policies, turning back a reflation trade on the dollar that had bet on swift moves to encourage repatriation of capital to the United States and boost spending.  Millennium’s Benson said Trump’s State of the Union speech in 10 days time might be crucial for those trades.  Trade on Monday will be cooled by the absence of U. S. markets for the Presidents Day holiday.  The opening in Europe saw equity markets rise, pointing to a broadly more positive mood globally after a solid Asian session. That tends to benefit several of the major currencies at the expense of ”safe havens” like the yen and Swiss franc.  ”After last week’s robust performance from the S&P index, Asian equities are modestly higher, commodity prices mostly knocking around at the higher end of ranges and in FX, that translates into a   market,” said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes. ”The yen is the obvious loser.”  (Editing by Catherine Evans) BERLIN U.

"Fairy wants to make daily housecleaning a thing – TechCrunch. A startup called Fairy wants to change the way consumers get their homes cleaned. Perhaps counterintuitively, the company is betting that by providing frequent, hotel-like housecleaning, it can actually lower the cost and provide a higher quality of service. Now operating in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City, Fairy has raised $4.1 million in funding from investors that include CrunchFund, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, Flight Ventures’ Gil Penchina, Charles Songhurst, Cyan and Scott Bannister, as well as Firebase co-founders James Tamplin and Andrew Lee. Pricing for Fairy’s service starts at $149 a month for twice-weekly cleaning sessions of 30 minutes each. But clients can make cleaning more frequent — up to five days a week — or increase the length of each session for slightly more per month. Fairy was founded by Nitin Gupta and Avlok Kohli. Gupta was most recently a managing director within Box’s sales team, but prior to that he had founded a company called LawPivot, which provided a marketplace for answers to legal questions and was acquired by Rocket Lawyer. Meanwhile, Kohli was founder of a company called Fastbite, which was acquired by Square and led to him becoming a part of the Caviar leadership team. Of course, the tech ecosystem is littered with the remains of housecleaning startups that were unable to figure out a profitable business model. But the Fairy team believes it can make the cleaning process more efficient in a few ways: First, more frequent cleanings means less work needs to be done each time. But the real trick in Fairy’s business comes from creating areas of client density and reducing the travel time its housecleaners have between cleanings. By ensuring that clients are limited to a certain neighborhood — and in some cases even in the same building — its housecleaners can serve more customers and squeeze more sessions into a day. The founders say a neighborhood usually needs at least five clients signed up for multi-week cleanings before it makes sense to refer a housecleaner to that area. According to Kohli, a business like Fairy’s can be run profitably if you set up the foundation and get the core economics right before expanding into a dozen markets. With that in mind, the company has been operating in San Francisco since early 2016, and it began limited service in New York City late last year. Some of the logistics work Kohli is using is borrowed from his time in the food logistics space, like splitting cities into zones to optimize travel time and ensure that there’s enough work for housecleaners to do. On that front, Fairy provides a more stable and predictable work schedule for cleaners, who still get to choose which clients they want to work with. And since every client is different, Fairy doesn’t prescribe a certain way for cleanings to be done — instead it leaves that up to client and service providers to figure out what is most important to be taken care of. Another way Fairy believes it can lower costs for itself and its cleaners is by not defining what supplies to use. Rather than requiring housecleaners to lug their own equipment or supplies from one building to another, the company asks clients to stock up on whatever cleaning materials housecleaners might need to get a job done. The folks at Fairy believe that by making supply purchasing and replenishment an add-on to its cleanings, it could lower the cost of the service further over time. But that’s for the future! For today, the company is officially launching its service and making it more widely available to customers.",0.0
" British Tabloids Are Mad They Can’t Write About An Alleged Celebrity Affair.  A privacy injunction by a UK court of appeal earlier this year blocked British media from writing about the alleged affair of a celebrity’s partner  —   a move that one tabloid is now calling a farce of justice since the story has been published in the U. S. The Daily Mail published a   article on Thursday headlined “Why The Law Is An Ass!” The Mail called the privacy law “draconian,” and accused rich and famous residents of the UK of hiding behind injunctions to cover up any potentially unflattering story. Under British laws, public figures may face criticism in the media  —   if a public interest outweighs their privacy. If a court determines there is no public interest to a story about a celebrity’s personal life, an injunction may be issued to prevent the story from being published. Under a super injunction, even the existence of a court’s decision may not be reported in the media. But with the advent of the internet, UK residents have access to global media who are not bound by similar laws. In the United States, for example, constitutional protections exist for a free press. U. S. media may often write about a person’s private life, if the story is true. When writing about public figures, the media has even more leeway a celebrity can only prove libel if the story is false, but that it was written with malicious intent. “Details of the celebrity’s infidelity and the threesome have been printed in the US and are available to 319million Americans,” the Mail wrote. “Information was also immediately available on social media and the names were even published in search inquiry results on the British site of Google. ” According to UK court of appeal records, the Sun on Sunday planned to write about a person who is   in the entertainment business and his partner. The court’s ruling took place in January, and it was reported by the Guardian after becoming public in March. The partner had met up in 2011 with another couple for a sexual encounter, the records said. Then couple then in January 2016 approached the newspaper to tell about their experience. The newspaper’s lawyers contacted the partner for comment, and he then started the court proceedings. “They maintained that they had not courted publicity about their private life,” the records said. “They said that the various press articles about them were substantially true. They had been in a relationship for many years. The relationship was an open one. ” A judge initially sided with the newspaper, saying that the entertainer and his partner’s public image of commitment gave an element of public interest to whether they had casual sexual encounters. The appellate court then reversed the judgment. “The claimant had an expectation that his sexual encounters will remain private,” the court said. “The proposed story, if it is published, will be devastating for the claimant. ” The court also said if the story were published, it would put the couple’s children at risk. “The children would become the subject of increased press attention, with all that that entails,” the court said. “Furthermore, even if the children do not suffer harassment in the   they are bound to learn about these matters from school friends and the internet in due course. ”  ",-1.0

"WTO review the perfect opportunity to tackle currency manipulation | TheHill. President Trump announced recently that he had tasked Commerce Secretary Wilbur RossWilbur Louis RossTrump administration delays penalty on Huawei for another 90 days  WaPo calls Trump admin 'another threat' to endangered species Recession fears surge as stock markets plunge MORE with undertaking a broad-based review of the U.S. membership in the World Trade Organization. Such a review is long overdue, but it should be expanded to include the U.S. membership in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a review of the U.S. law that identifies and sanctions currency manipulation by our trading partners. First, the WTO is woefully slow in addressing concerns about unfair trade practices. The United States should create a special WTO trade assistance counsel within the office of the U.S. Trade Representative for U.S. companies and industries to file complaints assisted by attorneys, free of charge, against foreign competitors they allege to be cheating. Those complainants whose cases are determined to be supported should be able to file their allegation with the WTO within 30 days. If, after another 90 days, the WTO has not resolved the matter, the United States should impose countervailing tariffs against the offending producer, to be held in escrow, until the case is resolved. If the case remains outstanding for another 60 days, the countervailing tariffs should become permanent and the escrow released to the complainant. In the meantime, as the case is working through the process, the United States should offer loans, credit and unemployment benefits to support the continuation of the business by the complainant company or industry until such time as the case is resolved. But Secretary Ross’s review of the WTO should go further. The United States should insist that the IMF adopt WTO-style sanctions on foreign currency manipulators or that the WTO expand the definition of an export subsidy to include currency manipulations. Ostensibly, the IMF already has rules that prohibit currency manipulation, but it has no enforcement mechanism to apply against malefactors. Similarly, the WTO does not include currency manipulation as an export subsidy in its rules. Consequently, instead of having the unified authority of the WTO to defend against currency manipulators, each nation is left to its own devices to enforce currency manipulation at its own border and with its own laws. Of course, the nations that “go it alone” to defend their market risk the possibility of the foreign manipulator commencing a retaliatory tariff against them. (Imagine how much more efficient the process would all be if all the nations in the WTO were to sanction manipulators that divert from market-based currency rates!) Until that happens, though, Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin should more aggressively enforce the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988, to identify not only “currency intervention (but) other actions undertaken to adjust the actual exchange rate of the dollar,” as described in Section 3005(b)(3) of the legislation. That’s because, as we have seen for some time, and even Paul Krugman acknowledges, currency manipulation can be achieved by more opaque means outside the currency markets. It is the unwritten policy for Germany and the European Central Bank to extend loans into the weaker economies of Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain — loans that are unlikely to ever be repaid — in order to have those countries remain part of the eurozone and thereby reduce the value of the euro relative to other currencies. It’s how Europe, and particularly Germany, has built up such a veritably impregnable favorable balance of payments (i.e., current account surplus at 8.3 percent of GDP in 2016) relative to competing nations.  The U.S. law should impute currency manipulation even if it occurs outside the currency markets and whenever consistent, aberrational trade balances occur. We can leave it to the WTO, the IMF or the foreign country itself to prove otherwise. Secretary Ross will need to take a bit more on his plate if he hopes to return the U.S. to a policy of fair trade among its trading partners.  J.G. Collins is the managing director of the Stuyvesant Square Consultancy in New York. A “Never Trumper” during the 2016 election, he is a long-time critic of the bipartisan U.S. policy of unlimited free trade.

"Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos has become the focus of a national debate over the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. .  (CNN) An undocumented mother of two   children who was deported to her native Mexico has become the focus of a national debate over the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.   In a matter of days, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos has gone from being one of about 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States to a poster child for critics of Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration and his promise to increase deportations. Garcia de Rayos, 35, emerged from her seemingly ordinary life after a yearly   Wednesday at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix.  It was her eighth visit since her 2008 arrest and conviction for using a fake Social Security number. After each meeting, she was released and returned to her family in Mesa.  This time, Garcia de Rayos was detained and deported to Mexico within 24 hours in what her attorney claims is a direct result of Trump’s crackdown.  ICE officials insist there was nothing special about her situation: She had committed a crime and was ordered deported. Now the case has become a flashpoint in the heated national dispute over Trump’s executive order that says any undocumented immigrant convicted or charged with a crime that hasn’t been adjudicated could be deported.  Mexico warns citizens after US deports undocumented mother, ’We don’t deserve to go through this’ For her part, Garcia de Rayos appears keenly aware of her role in this unfolding drama. Far from hiding from the cameras, she held a news conference Thursday night in Nogales, Mexico, and said she wants others to see what’s happened to her.  ”I did this so that more families could see what’s in store, what could happen, and so that they could know what they could risk,” she said, adding that Trump’s effort hurts the children of deported parents.  ”I am not what he says. I simply am a mother who fights for her children, who fights to give them the best.” During an interview in Nogales, Mexico, on Friday, Garcia de Rayos teared up when asked about missing holidays with her family or her daughter’s 15th birthday. But, she told CNN’s Polo Sandoval,”Deep down I always knew this could happen.”   She began to fear deportation ”when the President became the President,” Garcia de Rayos said, referring to Trump. ”Even before then he started threatening to deport people.” Garcia de Rayos’ children    who were born in the United States    crossed the border Thursday night to be with their mother. ”We don’t deserve to go through this,” her daughter, Jacqueline, told reporters. ”No family deserves to go through this. It’s heartbreaking. No one should feel this much pain no one should go through this much suffering.”  Activists and her attorney said they warned Garcia de Rayos she could be deported under Trump’s policy. They offered sanctuary at a church, but she decided to check in with ICE anyway, said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with the family.  ”She wanted to confront this,” Sandoval said. ”They were hopeful that there would be some consciousness and some heart.” Debate turns on mom’s case, Garcia de Rayos might be the first person deported from Arizona under Trump’s executive order, her attorney told CNN affiliate  . Her supporters said the deportation signals a marked changed from the policies of the Obama administration.   ”I think this is a direct result of the new executive orders that are being put into actions by President Trump calling them ’enhancing public safety,’ which really appears only to be attacking immigrant communities and people of color,” said her attorney, Ray Maldonado. Carlos Garcia, director of immigration rights group Puente Arizona, said, ”ICE had done what President Trump wanted    which is deport and separate our families.” But US immigration officials said this case followed the regular legal process and it was time for Garcia de Rayos to go back to her home country. ”(Her) immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US,” ICE said in a statement.  Immigration advocates say this deportation will cause other unauthorized immigrants to go into hiding. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, called it a travesty.  ”Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here for more than two decades and poses a threat to nobody,” he said.  But supporters of the move see the deportation as a positive example of Trump’s effort to preserve American jobs and ensure public safety. ”President Trump campaigned on the issue of enforcing the nation’s laws, and that’s exactly what is happening here,” Dave Ray, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. His nonprofit group backs more restrictive immigration policies. ”Someone who has been in the country illegally for two decades, received final deportation orders from the immigration courts in 2013 and is a convicted felon shouldn’t be the least bit shocked that she’s being deported.” A crackdown on illegal immigration, The executive order signed by Trump could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.  Trump’s plan won’t be easy. Just ask Obama, The order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by President Barack Obama.  The Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders.  Trump’s order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of ”criminal” and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety, regardless of whether the person has been convicted of a crime.",-1.0
"French Open 2015: Serena Williams wins 20th major. Paris (CNN) Serena Williams is closing in on Steffi Graf.  Despite being sapped by a nasty flu for much of the last week, the American beat Lucie Safarova     (2)   to win the French Open on Saturday and claim a landmark 20th major.  ”It seems a little bit like a dream,” Williams told reporters. ”Like, is this really my life? Is this really happening right now? So yeah, it’s really kind of weird.”  But as the score suggested, this was no walk in the Bois de Boulogne    a park close to Roland Garros    for Williams against the Czech. The way the tournament unfolded for the    perhaps it should have been expected.  Williams did the almost unthinkable by blowing a   advantage in the second set and trailed   in the third.   She recovered, to no one’s surprise, and now only Graf has more majors in the Open Era at 22. With Williams going strong in her early 30s, Graf’s record is under serious threat.  The world No. 1 even has a realistic chance of matching the German in 2015, since she’s claimed five Wimbledon titles and is the   defending champion at the U. S. Open.  Of course that would mean Williams winning all four majors in a season, something not accomplished since Graf did it in 1988.  But who’d rule her out?  Not her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. ”I think it’s the most difficult thing to do in tennis,” Mouratoglou told reporters. ”That’s why it doesn’t happen often. But as she won the first two, why not believe it’s possible? And second, with her, everything is possible.” By winning in Melbourne and Paris, Williams already became the first player since Jennifer Capriati in 2001 to claim the first two grand slams in the same season.  Heading into Saturday, it looked as if Williams might be vulnerable against Safarova, the 13th seed who was making her debut in a grand slam final.  Williams said via a    session released by the tournament Friday she had been suffering from the flu and ”collapsed” after her draining, comeback victory in three sets in the semifinals against Timea Bacsinszky.  She didn’t practice Friday, either, opting to stay at her apartment in Paris and rest.  ”She had so much fever,” said Mouratoglou. ”She stayed in bed the whole day. She tried to walk a little bit. It wasn’t brilliant so she came back.” The Frenchman added that on Saturday her condition improved and the fever disappeared.  ”I hit a little bit today in the morning and I hit them pretty well,” said Williams. ”I was just like, ’Okay, I have been playing for over 30 years, I know I can at least play tennis.’ After that I just went out to play a match.” When Williams went off court just before the final was about to begin, a dramatic afternoon seemed on the cards. It ended up that way, though no one would have predicted it when Williams surged to a huge lead in the second set.    Rallying from a set down to overcome   Friedsam, Victoria Azarenka, Sloane Stephens and then Bacsinszky, overturning a   deficit in the third was merely child’s play for Williams.  Of the seven majors they’ve won together in three years, Mouratoglou said this year in Paris marked Williams’   difficult path to glory behind Wimbledon in 2012. Williams, meanwhile, said it topped her entire list.  ”Here it was very difficult because she was very sick,” said Mouratoglou. ”She was without energy in matches, and to find the energy, she found emotions that were very deep.”  The malaise, coupled with the aftereffects of an elbow injury that forced her to withdraw from the Italian Open in Rome, led to Williams’ usually dominant serve only working in spurts this tournament    and little changed in the final.    In the first set Williams struck four aces and captured 80% of her   points.  Her return game was working, too. Williams manufactured the first break by ripping a   return for  .  Safarova,   against Williams prior to the final, saved a set point with a forehand winner that   her foe but Williams held serve a game later.  It was the first time Safarova dropped a set all tournament.  When Williams stormed to the   lead in the second, the trophy presentation was only moments away. Williams may have also thought it, given how she celebrated when breaking for      raising her arms in the air.  But Williams inexplicably plummeted, Safarova’s level improved and double faults on break points in the sixth and eighth games made the score  . Overall Williams hit five double faults in the second.   She broke with a stunning backhand   return for   yet once again couldn’t complete the job.  Safarova forced a tiebreak with a backhand winner down the line. The crowd, wanting more tennis, approved.   They were even louder when Williams’ forehand sailed into the set to officially force a decider. Williams, not prone to panicking, nonetheless had to be slightly alarmed when trailing by a break in the third.  Asked what he felt when Safarova led   Czech Fed Cup captain Petr Pala told CNN, ”I thought she had a chance. But it’s against Serena, so winning is still far away.” Could Williams, used to seeing her opponents this tournament not able to maintain leads, be the one crumbling? Nope.  Pumping herself up with some less than gentle language during the changeover at   Williams awoke. She surged to nine straight points and moved ahead  .  This time there was no comeback for Safarova, who fell behind   when her backhand down the line sailed long.  ”When she was on, she was just serving amazing and going for the returns, pressuring me right away,” said Safarova, who contests the doubles final Sunday with Bethanie  . ”It’s just hard to do anything with that.” Williams wrapped up her third French Open title    irrespective of it being her least productive grand slam, Mouratoglou said clay is her favorite surface    by forcing an error.  She paused for a moment, then dropped her racket in disbelief. Later she exchanged a hug with Mouratoglou.    Novak Djokovic, like Williams a world No. 1 and the champion at the Australian Open, plays in Sunday’s men’s final against Stan Wawrinka. Djokovic completed a semifinal win over Andy Murray earlier Saturday,          .  If he triumphs, then Djokovic becomes the eighth man in history to win all four majors. But Saturday belonged to Williams, even if she wasn’t in the mood to do much partying.  ”I just want to go to bed,” she said.  Read: Djokovic sees off Murray to reach men’s final",-1.0
"’Clinton Cash’ Passes 3.5 Million Views on YouTube - Breitbart. Demand for the motion picture adaptation of New York Times bestseller Clinton Cash has soared since its global premiere, with online viewership of the groundbreaking documentary surpassing 3. 5 million. [Views of the film on Breitbart News’ YouTube channel and the Philly Blunt pirated YouTube version have cleared a combined count of more than 3. 5 million views.  The overwhelming popularity of the Clinton Cash documentary  —   directed by M. A. Taylor and written and produced by Danny Fleuette and Stephen K. Bannon  —   was evident after it had garnered more than 500, 000 views online 48 hours after its worldwide release and trended on Facebook for all three days of the Democratic National Convention. Buzz around the film was spurred by the July 26 release of the paperback version of Clinton Cash, as well as the August 8 debut of the Clinton Cash graphic novel. Clinton Cash exposes the alarming pattern of   speaking fees to Bill Clinton and major donations to the Clinton Foundation from foreign contributors, which conspicuously coincided with favors for foundation donors while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State. The documentary’s current online view count does not include an accounting of those who have watched the recently released director’s cut of the film, attended watch parties, watched the film during its debut over the weekend on One America News Network or viewed it via myriad other pirated formats.

"The Dolphins of Arizona. , I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Cetaceans near Scottsdale? It’s happening. The   theme park operator in Mexico, Ventura Entertainment, will open its first “dolphinarium” in the United States in July. The attraction, operated by Ventura’s subsidiary Dolphinaris, is located in the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona, and will provide similar    activities the company offers at its five locations in Mexico. The facilities have drawn criticism from   activists, who say the desert of a landlocked state is no place for dolphins, social and intelligent marine creatures that can swim up to 100 miles a day. Local protesters have organized a demonstration, “Empty the Tanks,” which will take place in Scottsdale next month. More than 100, 000 people have signed an online petition against the “dolphinarium. ” The petition says that Arizona summers, characterized by abundant sunshine and dry conditions, could negatively affect the dolphins’ health. Dolphinaris explains on its website that “the   and the appropriate attention of the dolphins under our care is our absolute priority. We satisfy every physical and behavior need, including supervision of natural behavior of the species and reproduction programs. ” The attraction is located near OdySea, an indoor aquarium that opened last year and houses sharks and other ocean dwellers, but not whales and dolphins. “You need larger facilities for that and there’s a lot of controversy, and there’s no need,” OdySea CEO Amram Knishinsky said in 2014. Public opinion of tourist attractions that feature marine creatures has increasingly soured since the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which investigated the captive orcas living in SeaWorld, the U. S. chain of marine mammal parks. Last month, SeaWorld announced it would end its   programs and eventually cease its   performance shows.             Like this?

"EU antitrust regulators charge Google for third time. EU antitrust regulators accused Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday of preventing rivals from competing with the company in the lucrative online search advertising market, bringing their third charge against the company. The European Commission also reinforced its existing charge against the world's most popular Internet search engine that its search results favour Google's own shopping service over that of rivals. The Commission said in a statement that it had sent two ""statements of objections"" to Google. The new charge sheet accuses Google of having abused its dominant position by artificially preventing third party websites from displaying search advertisements from its competitors. This relates to Google's ""AdSense for Search"" platform, in which Google acts as an intermediary for websites such as those of online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers, with searches producing results that include search ads. It also said it had reinforced its preliminary conclusion that Google had abused its dominant position by systematically favouring its comparison shopping service in its search result pages.",0.0
"Mulvaney tells department heads to stay quiet amid budget rollout | TheHill. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney is warning the heads of departments and agencies to limit remarks on spending levels for next year. A memo obtained by The Hill notes that in the coming weeks, many department leaders will testify before congressional committees regarding the White House’s fiscal 2018 budget blueprint. “Until OMB releases the full FY 2018 Budget,” the memo, sent Friday, says, “all public comments of any sort should be limited to the information contained in the Budget Blueprint chapter for your agency.” The letter adds, “It is critically important that you not make commitments about specific programs if they are not expressly mentioned in the Budget Blueprint. “Similarly, you should not address account-level details. Comments on such specifics need to wait until the release of the full Budget. “Agency officials appearing as witnesses in authorization, appropriations, or oversight hearings should defer any questions related to the full Budget until after the Budget is released.” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was scheduled to appear before the House Appropriations Committee this week to discuss the budget for the Department of Education, but that hearing has been postponed. Mulvaney’s letter notes a “strong preference that only heads of executive Departments and Agencies or the Acting Head of the Department or Agency should testify on the FY 2018 Budget Blueprint.” President Trump last Thursday made public his first federal budget blueprint, revealing a plan to dramatically reduce the size of government. The document calls for deep cuts at departments and agencies that would eliminate entire programs and slash the size of the federal workforce. It also proposes a $54 billion increase in defense spending, which the White House says will be offset by the other cuts.  View the discussion thread.

In an email to Robert Black, CEO of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) which manages the 1970s social housing property on behalf of the local authority, one resident explained “we had numerous power surges in the space of a minute, and in that process my computer and monitor literally exploded, with smoke seeping out from the back”. According to the July minutes of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea’s housing and property scrutiny committee, KCTMO “carried out some repairs and continue to monitor the situation. It is too early to say whether the problem has been fully resolved and here responsibility lies for the cause. It is possible that the fault that has been rectified is not the primary cause. ” The cause of the surges, which are now likely to be reviewed following claims that last week’s blaze started when a resident’s fridge went up in flames, were just one of many concerns about fire safety that the residents have raised with KCTMO down the years. As far back as 2004 they flagged up issues with the building’s emergency lighting system, which was supposed to activate in the event of a fire. KCTMO denied there was a problem. But an independent consultancy it hired to look into the matter disagreed and issued a series of urgent recommendations for how the system had to be improved. An assessment five years ago suggested monthly inspections of fire extinguishers were not being carried out. In some cases, the extinguishers had not been tested for years. More recently the Grenfell Action Group (GAG) which represents the interests of the largely immigrant tenants who lived in the tower, warned about the fire threat posed by discarded rubbish, and complained that parked vehicles were blocking access for the emergency services. The council’s   £10m   transformation of the tower  —   completed in 2016  —   was another source of concern. In an email sent in 2014 to the chief fire officer at Kensington fire station, a member of GAG said that residents feared the improvement works had turned the building into a “fire trap”. He wrote: “There is only one entry and exit to the tower block itself and, in the event of a fire, the London fire brigade could only gain access to the entrance to the building by climbing four flights of narrow stairs. On top of this, the fire escape exit on the walkway level has now been sealed. Residents of Grenfell Tower do not have any confidence that our building has been satisfactorily assessed to cope with the new improvement works. ” Angry that their concerns appeared to be falling on deaf ears, in June 2016 the residents association attended the council’s housing and property scrutiny committee and let rip. They presented a survey suggesting that 90% of them were unhappy with the improvement works and that 68% of them believed they had been lied to, threatened or pressured by KCTMO, which they accused of serial incompetence. In a horribly prescient blog post, written last November, they said that they had “reached the conclusion that only an incident that results in serious loss of life of KCTMO residents will allow the external scrutiny to occur that will shine a light on the practices that characterise the malign governance of this   organisation”. Time, and a public inquiry, will help establish whether a lax fire safety culture was operating at Grenfell Tower. But it is clear that the failures that resulted in last week’s catastrophic loss of life are not confined to one organisation or one London borough. Tragically for the victims, they were manifold, the consequences of systemic tensions that spring from trying to provide that most basic of needs  —   shelter  —   at a time when budgets are stretched and politicians’ priorities lie elsewhere. On New Year’s Eve 2016 a huge fire ripped through Dubai’s luxury Address Downtown Hotel, a   tower that stands opposite the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. The Downtown blaze followed fires at two other landmark Dubai buildings, the Marina Torch and the Tamweel Tower. As with fires that devastated buildings in other parts of the Middle East, China, France, Turkey, and now Grenfell Tower, the building’s exterior cladding is believed to have been a factor in the spread of the flames. But concerns about the increasing use of cheaper, synthetic composites in place of conventional construction materials, such as steel and concrete, are not new. In 1991, the flammability of cladding was a key factor in the fire that destroyed an apartment block in Knowsley Heights, Liverpool. In 1999, expert witnesses to the environment, transport and regional affairs committee, including the Fire Brigades Union and the Loss Prevention Council  —   the technical advisers to the insurance industry  —   suggested that the guidelines on cladding were inadequate. The Building Research Establishment, which advises the government on safety and carries out tests on construction materials, agreed that the existing guidance was “far from being totally adequate”. Alarmed at the implications, the committee wrote to councils asking to “receive from you assurances that any cladding systems which may be used on any buildings, particularly multistorey tower blocks, in your area are not in any way susceptible to the risk of serious fire spread on the face of, or immediately behind the cladding”. But this latest alarm bell  —   clearly ringing  —   did not stop the trend for cladding the outside of Britain’s ageing tower blocks. Not only did cladding help insulate the towers, allowing governments to meet   targets, it transformed the concrete behemoths that mushroomed across urban Britain in the 60s and 70s and were viewed as unsightly compared with their    successors. Grenfell Tower’s £10m makeover saw it encased in aluminium composite panels that have a synthetic core and are manufactured by a subsidiary of a US firm, Arconic. Some of the more expensive cores are more fire resistant but Grenfell was fitted with a cheaper version, banned in the US for taller buildings because of safety concerns. Some estimates suggest that the additional cost of fitting the   product would have been as little as £5, 000. Rydon, the contractor that oversaw the renovations, having taken the contract from another firm, Leadbitter, whose original £11. 6m quote for the job was considered too high, insisted that the work met all fire regulations. And Harley Facades, the company that fitted the panels, said in a statement shortly after the fire: “We are not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. ” But David Sibert, fire safety adviser to the Fire Brigades Union, said: “It appears from what we’ve seen that the cladding certainly did play a part. It may be fully compliant with the legislation and the problem may be with the tests that are linked to the legislation. ” Put simply,   laboratory tests may not be able to reproduce the true effects of a blaze at a tower block. Sibert asked: “Does the way a material is installed in a test replicate the way it is installed in real life? There may be gaps when it’s installed between one piece and another, whereas just one solid piece is tested. ” Grenfell’s makeover, however, was not just an external job. A communal heating system was installed, and new gas pipes were fitted in the stairwells. Did this have consequences for the tower’s communal areas? “I would be interested to know why it was that the corridors and staircases became ” Sibert said. “If you had a single fire in a single flat, if the building works properly, there should be virtually no smoke in the corridor and no smoke in the staircases. If there is smoke it suggests there is something wrong with the compartmentation. ” A fire last April at another property managed by KCTMO, the   Trellick Tower, suggests there was something catastrophically different about the design of Grenfell Tower. According to the council’s minutes, the Trellick fire “did not spread and was contained within. .. indicating that the levels of compartmentation  —   both between neighbouring flats and also between the flat and the communal areas  —   are of the required level”. In a newsletter to residents, dated May 2016, KCTMO and Rydon jointly explained that the tower’s “smoke detection systems have been upgraded and extended”. But some residents claim the alarms failed to go off. The Metropolitan police last night said that 58 people had either died in Grenfell Tower or were “missing, presumed dead”. The tragedy has raised fears about safety at the rest of the UK’s 4, 000 or so tower blocks and, in particular, the 87 that are clad with similar materials to Grenfell Tower. A fire caused by a faulty tumble drier at a social housing tower block, in nearby Shepherd’s Bush raised concerns about the flammability of modern construction materials as recently as last August. Last October, the London fire brigade wrote to Hammersmith and Fulham council explaining that it had witnessed tests that raised concerns about the insulation material that had been used in the Shepherd’s Bush tower’s panelling. “Once exposed, the insulation, as well as the wooden backing, appears to contribute to the combustion process, potentially increasing the size of the flames and fire. Therefore the facade system may have contributed to the external fire spread. ” In a letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the council responded: “We are surprised to be informed of any fire risk associated with the facade panels, as we had no knowledge of this prior to your letter. We invite you to confirm who carried out the testing referred to, as you appear only to have witnessed it. ” Fear that councils were ignorant of the fire risks associated with tower blocks prompted the government’s chief fire and rescue adviser to recommend to the London Assembly in 2010 that “an extensive programme of auditing of . ..   blocks should be undertaken to determine whether or not suitable and sufficient   assessments were in place. ” It is not known if the borough of Kensington and Chelsea acted on this advice. The recommendation followed the 2009 fire at Lakanal House, a tower block in Southwark, south London, which killed six people. In 2013, Frances Kirkham, the coroner who conducted the inquest, outlined several suggestions as to how a similar tragedy could be avoided. in the future. Kirkham said there was a need to resolve conflicting guidance for those in   blocks as to whether they should “stay put” or “get out, stay out”. Fire safety notices told Grenfell Tower residents to stay put. Several believe they are alive only because they ignored this advice. Kirkham also recommended that the government encourage councils to retrofit sprinklers in tower blocks. But the government saw this as an unnecessary burden and suggested instead that it be left to the fire industry to “encourage their wider installation”. This was a tragic missed opportunity, according to Sibert. “If the building had been provided with sprinklers then that fire, if it started in the kitchen, would never have got out of the kitchen and nobody except the firefighters who would have gone there to mop up would have known about it. ” Sprinklers were retrofitted in a similar tower at Callow Mount in Sheffield two years ago at a cost of £1, 100 per flat. The Fire Brigades Union claims there has never been a multiple death in a building fitted with sprinklers. In Wales, any new residential accommodation must have sprinklers, but in England this rule applies only to blocks of flats more than 30 metres high. “And if it’s for students or student nurses it doesn’t need sprinklers because they are classed as ‘other residential’,” Sibert said. “That’s a piece of nonsense that needs sorting out. ” In her recommendations, Kirkham acknowledged the need to overhaul building regulations governing fire safety, something others agree is long overdue. “We have been signalling for years that the building regulations were not robust enough and we were ignored by government after government,” Baroness Brinton, the Lib Dem peer who sits on the   parliamentary group on fire safety, told the Observer. In 2015, the then communities minister, Stephen Williams, told parliament that a review of building regulations would be delivered before the end of the financial, year  . But three successive housing ministers  —   including Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s new chief of staff  —   have failed to deliver on the promise. “The review hasn’t started,” Sibert explained. “It’s being kicked down the road. ” Whitehall insiders suspect that civil servants have been diverted away from the review to other, ostensibly more pressing issues, chiefly the need to deliver Brexit. In the lacuna, policing the archaic building regulations has been hampered by the need for local authorities to make savings. A 2014 report by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority warned of the consequences of councils’   building control teams having to compete against private contractors. The authority said: “The fact that there is competition puts pressure into the system, by potentially diminishing rigour in an effort to win work. Some   teams express fear that their own council colleague project officers could choose other providers. Projects are signed off before they should be because of pressure for schemes to be completed. ” Historically, an additional level of oversight has been provided by the fire service’s fire safety departments who carry out   inspections. But it is estimated that the number of dedicated inspectors has halved in the last decade as the government has looked to make savings. Sibert said: “In order to protect the front line  —   firefighters on the engines  —   fire safety departments were among the first to be cut to save money. ” Now the rationale for those cuts is under scrutiny and the anger being trained on a paralysed Westminster is giving way to fury. As someone tweeted: “Cost of general election £130m. Additional cost of fire resistant cladding for Grenfell Tower: £5, 000. ”",-0.5
"US utility: Alleged Russian malware on laptop.  (CNN) The indicators from the malicious software found on a Burlington Electric Company laptop match those on malware found in the Democratic National Committee computers that the US government has blamed on Russians, the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday. DHS spokesman Todd Breasseale said the department’s investigation into the cyber intrusion on the computer is ongoing and he couldn’t comment further. The DHS’s acknowledgment is the first such confirmation by the government that the malware is the same as the code used in malicious cyber activity that the US government has blamed on Russian hackers attempting to influence November’s election.  It comes a day after Burlington Electric announced it found the malicious software on a computer that was not connected to its grid control systems. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the utility said Saturday there are no indications that the electric grid was breached.  Burlington Electric General Manager Neale Lunderville told CNN’s Suzanne Malveaux that the utility found an Internet address that was associated with recent malicious cyber activity, and that IP address was communicating with a company computer.  ”We immediately isolated the machine, pulled it off the network, alerted federal authorities and began to work with them,” he said.  Burlington Electric, which serves 19, 600 customers in Vermont, said it found the code after utility companies nationwide were sent an alert by Homeland Security.  The federal government refers to the Russian malicious cyber activity as Grizzly Steppe. Officials involved in the investigation of the malware say they do not believe it was an attempt to bring down part of the electric grid.  One reason why, they cited, is that Burlington Electric is a small utility and therefore the impact would not be as great as if it were a larger company with many more customers.  The Washington Post first reported the existence of the malicious software. Burlington Electric issued a statement Saturday saying that any reports that the company was hacked or breached are false. It added there are no indications that customer information was accessed.  Gov. Shumlin calls Putin a ”thug”  Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin didn’t hold back in a scathing message issued Friday that linked Russian President Vladimir Putin to the cyber threat. ”Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our    economy, health, and safety,” said Shumlin in a written statement.  Shumlin, a Democrat, called on the federal government to investigate and take action to prevent future attacks.   ”This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling,” said Shumlin.   US Sen. Patrick Leahy,   said he and his staff were briefed Friday by Vermont state police about the development, which he called a ”direct threat to Vermont.” ”  Russian hacking is a serious threat, and the attempts to penetrate the electric grid through a Vermont utility are the latest example,” Leahy said.  ”This is beyond hackers having electronic joyrides    this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter.” A US government official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday it’s not yet known ”the full scope or intent, or if this was an isolated event or not.” After weeks of   accusations about Russian hacking around the US election, the White House announced plans Thursday to expel 35 Russian diplomats    giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country    and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials, in theory, for recreational purposes. The Russian government has denied the hacking allegations. The DHS and the FBI made a   report public Thursday with information about the malware code    which was found on Democratic National Committee computers    and urged entities to check for it. Targets? ’Government, think tanks, universities’ The report said activity by Russian civilian and military intelligence services is ”part of an ongoing campaign of   operations directed at the US government and its citizens.” Russian operations went after ”government organizations, critical infrastructure entities, think tanks, universities, political organizations, and corporations,” according to the report.  The hackers sent fake emails, texts and other messages attempting to get US users to click on malicious links, US officials have said. Some links led users to download the malware while others prompted people to change their passwords, which the hackers could then use.  A US official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN that the Obama administration sought to alert utilities and other entities in the United States and abroad to the malicious activity so they could better secure their networks. In December 2015, Ukraine was struck by a massive cyberattack that cut power to 103 cities and towns and affected 186 more. The attack involved a team of sophisticated hackers who targeted six power companies at the same time, US officials briefed on an investigation into the attack told CNN in February.  Destructive malware wrecked computers and wiped out sensitive control systems for parts of the Ukraine power grid, making it more difficult for technicians to restore power. The attack raised major concerns because the US power grid and other major industrial facilities have many of the same vulnerabilities that were exploited in the Ukraine attack, US officials told CNN. In February, Elizabeth   the Obama administration’s deputy energy secretary, accused Russia of being behind the cyberattack.  Other top US intelligence and security officials said then that the evidence wasn’t conclusive enough to tie the Russian government to the attack.",-1.0
"European stocks end under pressure; commodities eyed; Air France up 10.7%. Europe's stock markets finished mixed on Thursday as optimism on earnings failed to completely offset turbulence surrounding various commodities and the performance in U.S. markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 finished roughly flat, with weak trade in U.S. weighing on sentiment. France's CAC came off session highs to close 0.15 percent up, while Germany's DAX ended 0.9 percent higher. London's FTSE 100 however slumped 1 percent, as several U.K. listed miners slipped. An initial rise in the price of oil gave a lift to market sentiment, after Iran said it supported a production ""ceiling"" to stabilize prices, however this didn't mean a commitment to limit Iran's production. Prices, however, came under pressure after the EIA reported that U.S. crude stockpiles had risen by 2.1 million barrels in the last week. Brent last hovered around $34.40, while U.S. crude dipped below $31. Inside the oil and gas sector, Tullow Oil sank to the bottom of Europe's benchmarks, off more than 11 percent after the oil and gas producer said it had to change some of its operational procedures at its Jubilee field in Ghana, having identified a potential equipment issue. The sector closed 0.9 percent down, however Seadrill finished up near 2 percent, with Total also closing in the green. Basic Resources stocks continued to come under pressure as metal prices saw more declines. Glencore and Rio Tinto both closed sharply lower, while an increase in gold and silver prices boosted precious metal firms Fresnillo and Randgold Resources. Anglo American was off some 7.7 percent, as its credit rating was downgraded to ""junk"" by Standard & Poor's on Thursday. Fitch Ratings and Moody's have also cut their ratings on the miner's debt this week. On the earnings front, hotel group Accor reported a 2.3 percent rise in full year sales for 2015, to 5.58 billion euros ($6.2 billion) but said booking cancellations after the Paris terrorist attacks led to a sharp drop in France. Shares finished 2.7 percent higher. Air France-KLM surged some 10.7 percent after it swung to profit in 2015, posting operating profit of 816 million euros ($909 million) compared with a 129 million euro loss in 2014. Meanwhile, Nestle anticipated ""softer pricing"" in 2016 after reporting results that missed analyst expectations, sending shares sliding 3.7 percent. British defence firm BAE Systems said that it expects its earnings per share to grow up to 10 percent in 2016 from the 2015 level of 36.6 pence, sending shares over 1 percent higher. Europe's top performer was Indivior, up 15.8 percent, after the pharmaceuticals firm reported better-than-expected earnings for 2015. Europe's Banks was the worst performing sector, off some 2.3 percent, with several Italian banks at the bottom of Europe's benchmarks. This comes as the European Central Bank said risk for the euro zone economy have grown, according to its latest minutes release. On the whole, Europe's earnings picture remains mixed.

"Politico: Ryan Has ’No Concerns’ with Bannon as Trump Chief of Staff - Breitbart. From Politico:[Paul Ryan on Sunday said he has “no concerns” about   Donald Trump hiring one of the speaker’s longtime critics as his chief of staff: Breitbart chief Steve Bannon. “I’ve never met the guy,” Ryan said on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” “I don’t know Steve Bannon so I have no concerns. I trust Donald’s judgment. I think he will pick who will best serve him, and I’m sure we will work well with whomever his chief of staff is. ” Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart who joined Trump’s campaign in August as CEO, is believed to be one of two finalists for the top White House post. The other is Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, a close Ryan ally and fellow Wisconsinite. Trump is expected to announce his chief of staff within days. Read the rest here.  ",1.0
"U.S. lawmakers say Trump administration still lacks clear North Korea plan.  U. S. lawmakers said   briefings by the Trump administration on North Korea on Wednesday failed to provide the firm strategy they had hoped for dealing with what they described as a major national security threat. As a standoff escalated over the reclusive Asian nation’s development of nuclear weapons and   ballistic missiles, President Donald Trump welcomed all 100 members of the Senate to a highly unusual meeting at the White House complex, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While administration officials often travel to the Capitol to brief lawmakers on national security issues, this time the entire Senate hopped on buses to the White House. Vice President Mike Pence and the four officials later briefed the House of Representatives. That classified meeting took place in a secure auditorium at the Capitol complex. The briefings came as Trump tries to put the best face on his first 100 days in office. He has signed executive orders to roll back Democratic policies but the period has been defined by an absence of any major legislative achievements. A few Democrats dismissed the Senate White House ”field trip” as little more than a photo opportunity.  Some Republicans were a little more enthusiastic. ”It was an OK briefing,” Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters as he arrived back at the Senate. ”I’m not certain I would have had the briefing today,” he said. Asked if the administration had a firm strategy, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said, ”They’re developing one.” This week, Trump has discussed North Korea with U. N. ambassadors, increased the U. S. military presence in the region, and leaned on China to pressure Pyongyang. Tillerson will chair a U. N. Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss tougher sanctions. After their briefing, members of the House expressed confidence in the administration officials who spoke, but some said they had real concerns. Representative Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was not convinced that the administration would do enough to control Pyongyang. ”I regard that level of resolve as very modest, weak and maybe even phony. The only way to put enough pressure on North Korea is to get China to do it,” Sherman told reporters. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration wants to use ”a variety” of tactics to push North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and said he agreed that all options must be on the table. ”We have to have incredible military presence in the region, including missile defense, especially for this regime,” he said.

"Theo Walcott at the double in comfortable Arsenal win against Basel. Theo Walcott’s shoulders slumped a little as the board was hoisted here. The winger stood in the middle of the pitch, hands on hips and disbelief etched across his brow, as he digested the fact his number was up just as he was contemplating plundering the   his performance had deserved. His was a trudge to the touchline thereafter as the majority in the arena chorused their appreciation. That reception, and this saunter to the top of the group, should serve as consolation. This was another scintillating performance from Arsenal, such an irrepressible attacking force over recent weeks, to overwhelm tricky opponents but it was the bite offered by Walcott that truly wounded Basel. He is in one of those purple patches, where every pass finds him in space, every marker is unnerved by his gliding presence and every shot flies in. This was the first time he had scored twice in a Champions League game for almost nine years but on this form and with his team maintaining their upbeat rhythm of recent weeks he can be prolific. Only Robin van Persie has scored more goals in this stadium than Walcott’s 45. He is a player revived by a summer of feverish work with his personal trainer, Bradley Simmonds, and has returned fit, focused and intent upon making his mark with his manager, who spoke with the player in   having taken to regularly praising the forward’s positive attitude. “It’s not the chat that makes you score goals,” said Wenger of his summer discussions with Walcott. “Theo assessed well where he stands and rectified well what he had to add to his game. It’s 95% down to him. ” It is undoubtedly about time he imposed himself consistently at this level, but there is still time for him to fulfil the potential of his youth. On this evidence, a player who was used as a substitute in Sam Allardyce’s only game in charge of England may have a part to play from the start in Gareth Southgate’s first match as interim manager, against Malta next month. “The best recommendation [for an England recall] is his performances,” Wenger said. “It’s difficult to ignore him if you see him playing like this, but I will leave that to Southgate. ” Basel, a team already 13 points clear at the top of the Swiss league, had no answer and duly subsided to their first defeat of the season. They wilted under Arsenal’s   onslaught that, just as against Chelsea on Saturday, effectively settled the contest. Alexis Sánchez was elusive, tormenting Marek Suchy and Taulant Xhaka at the heart of the visitors’ rearguard. Alex Iwobi was a menace from the left, his interchanges with Mesut Özil leaving opponents dizzied while on the opposite flank Walcott ran riot. At times it was painful watching Eder Balanta’s attempts to snuff out the threat. The Colombian was bypassed so often the mismatch almost felt cruel. The goals were pilfered early. The Swiss had never really recovered from the slick    passing that culminated in Nacho Monreal drawing the first of many saves from an overworked but impressive Tomas Vaclik seven minutes in. Once Santi Cazorla had recycled the ball in midfield and liberated Sánchez down the left, the Chilean played onside by the hapless Balanta, Basel’s defence was dishevelled. Sánchez’s delivery was perfect and Walcott, bursting away from Xhaka, nodded powerfully in. That was his third goal in three games but as he drifted from flank to centre there were always likely to be further rewards. Just as Urs Fischer’s side had dared to hope they had weathered the storm, Sánchez and Walcott exchanged passes at pace, cutting out Balanta in the process, and the Englishman crisply dispatched a second across Vaclik and in off the far post. Thereafter the goalkeeper denied Arsenal a cricket score, saving from Sánchez and the marauding Héctor Bellerín. Iwobi and Mesut Özil should have given him no chance only for their efforts to fly off target. Only profligacy spared the Swiss a proper hiding. Therein lies Arsenal’s room for improvement because while the advantage remained at two David Ospina was anxious as Birkir Bjarnason forced him to save. Wenger cut an anxious figure on the bench at times in the second half, apparently concerned his players felt the job was long since done. “It looks like the team has interesting potential, so we have to be ambitious and continue to develop,” he said. “We know exactly how we want to play football. That demands complete focus, some leadership inside the squad and some humility. “It’s down to hard work, but also to belief. The confidence comes from the last few results, too. We hadn’t beaten Chelsea at home for a few games, and now it looks like we’re playing with full power and pace. ” It was all too much for Basel and leaves Arsenal top of the group with Paris  . Theirs is a campaign full of promise.",-0.5
"From prima ballerina to top choreographer.  (CNN) She’s taken the New York City Ballet by storm with her lush, lyrical movements as a principal dancer, but now Lauren Lovette is raising curtains on an even bigger stage.  This September, she debuted her first work of choreography for the company    a major step for any    dancer, but especially for a woman. ”As a ballerina, you’re quiet most of the time, you’re used to being the paint. And to switch over and then be the painter takes guts,” Lovette says. ”It’s hard. You have to listen to the music over and over again and understand it so well and then when you look at it all together it’s almost like you’re watching a symphony, you’re watching the music.” Lovette’s first piece, ”For Clara,” was one of the most anticipated parts of the company’s fall gala on Sept. 20.  Inspired by everyday movements and the long hours spent working with dancers in the studio, it was set to a classical score by Robert Schumann. ”I’m particularly excited about Lauren Lovette. I’ve watched her matriculate through the various stages of artistry here at the company, ” said actress Sarah Jessica Parker, a vice chair of the New York City Ballet board of directors.  ”We want more and more women choreographers, so I just think it’s very exciting and important, and I think it’s been extremely fulfilling for Lauren.”  Watch Lauren Lovette’s journey from ballet dancer to choreographer in the video above.

"Donald Trump’s Campaign Hires Ex-Christie Aide to Bolster Political Operation - The New York Times. Donald J. Trump’s campaign has hired Bill Stepien, a former top aide to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose role in the Bridgegate scandal led to his firing and denied him the central role he was expected to play in the governor’s presidential run. Mr. Stepien is expected to step in to help guide the campaign’s political operations, according to two people close to Mr. Stepien and three people close to the Trump campaign who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Mr. Stepien was hired on Thursday, and one person who confirmed the hire said his title was expected to be national field director. A campaign spokesman did not respond to an email seeking comment. But the people who confirmed the hire said that Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner, who is heavily involved in spending and strategy decisions in the campaign, discussed it in staff briefings and pushed for it to occur. Mr. Christie is the chief of Mr. Trump’s transition committee, but he is no longer close to Mr. Stepien and was said to have been uninvolved in the discussions to hire him. Mr. Stepien is expected to help beef up a political operation that has been a work in progress for several weeks. He had initially been contacted by the Trump campaign earlier this year as Mr. Christie’s campaign for president was sputtering. When the issue was revisited after Mr. Christie dropped out of the race, both the governor and Mr. Trump’s   manager, Corey Lewandowski, opposed hiring him, according to people briefed at the time. Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump over many years, described the move as a positive one. ‘He’s a real professional and has the kind of contacts and experience the campaign could really use,” Mr. Stone said. For Mr. Stepien, 38, it is a chance to resurrect what was once a promising career as a national political operative. He successfully ran both of Mr. Christie’s campaigns for governor. Mr. Christie had hired him as a consultant to the Republican Governor’s Association during his year as chairman of that group. In January 2014, Mr. Christie picked him to lead the New Jersey Republican party, calling Mr. Stepien “the best Republican operative in the country. ” It was widely expected that he would run Mr. Christie’s presidential campaign. Days after the appointment, Mr. Christie cut Mr. Stepien loose, when documents from a legislative subpoena revealed that a deputy chief of staff to the governor, Bridget Anne Kelly, had sent an email calling for “some traffic problems in Fort Lee,” the town gridlocked by the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge between the borough and Manhattan in September 2013. Prosecutors, who indicted Ms. Kelly and two other Christie allies in the lane closings, have said the   were retaliation against the Fort Lee mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Mr. Christie for   in 2013. The governor gave little reason for why he dropped Mr. Stepien other than to say he had “lost confidence in Bill’s judgment” after other emails showed Mr. Stepien referring to the mayor of Fort Lee as “an idiot”  —   the kind of language Mr. Christie has been known to employ publicly. Mr. Stepien was not among the three people charged by federal prosecutors in the lane closings. But earlier this month, a lawyer for one of other defendants released texts from a conversation between two Christie staffers during the   news conference in which the governor denied knowing about the lane closings. “He just flat out lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved,” one staffer wrote to the other. Mr. Stepien’s lawyer has insisted that his client was not involved in the scandal, and that the text does nothing to prove his involvement. Mr. Stepien had earlier refused to turn over documents or otherwise cooperate with a legislative committee investigating the lane closing scandals, asserting his Fifth Amendment rights against  . Mr. Stepien’s career had all but hit a wall after Mr. Christie let him go. He did some work for a Republican direct mail firm and for New Jersey legislative campaigns and had discussions about working on the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as well as on Mr. Trump’s campaign in New Hampshire  —   all before Mr. Christie dropped out of the race. In April, the governor’s lieutenant, Kim Guadagno, named Mr. Stepien as executive director of a nonprofit set up to support her expected campaign for governor, a move Mr. Christie had opposed. The Trump campaign recently underwent a major   with the ascension of both the veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway, an adviser whom Mr. Trump has known for many years and one he trusts, and of Stephen K. Bannon, the financial force behind the Breitbart News website. Since then, there has been an effort to hire another political hand, with David Bossie, the head of the conservative group, Citizens United, briefly discussed as possibility, but national Republicans expressed reservations over his lack of experience directing campaign political operations.",-1.0
"The Geography of U.S. Productivity. A host of reasons have been suggested for why productivity has been declining: slowing innovation, inefficiency in sectors that have become huge, inability to adequately measure innovations on the internet, and a lack of spending and investment, to name a few. To get a better understanding of how productivity varies across the county, Joseph Parilla and Mark Muro, both fellows at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, looked into productivity growth at the local level and how the geographical variation of productivity relates to the declining national figures. It’s natural that productivity varies across regions. Across the U. S. there are varying resources, industries, workers, technology, government policies, and incentives that play into how businesses and workers develops. But Muro and Parilla believe that productivity is often overlooked when studying local economies. That, they say, is a mistake, since productivity is key for   wage growth and improving living standards. The difficulty in studying localities and comparing them with the national picture is largely because of the lack of comparable data. At the Labor Department, productivity is measured by comparing labor input (hours worked) to a sector’s output (in dollars). At the regional scale, Parilla and Muro use   output from Moody’s Analytics and employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate local productivity. In doing so, they observe massive variations across the U. S. economy, from an average of $299, 000 per worker a year in Midland, Texas to $38, 000 per worker in Jacksonville, North Carolina. According to their research, the largest U. S. cities tend to be the most productive areas, along with areas in the energy belt that specialize in oil, gas, and mining. The low end of the productivity spectrum consisted of smaller cities in the southern and southwestern U. S. These findings aren’t that surprising given that cities and boom towns tend to be more productive. San Jose, California ranked as the nation’s most productive metropolitan area, with labor productivity growth at 2. 7 percent between 1978 and 2015. “San Jose is extraordinary because of the depth and high performance. It’s the ultimate example of cluster effects, and as such has astronomical productivity readings and very high density of critical     advanced industries. There, these most productive industries comprise more than 30 percent of all employment compared to an average of 9 percent in the largest 100 metros. So it’s an extreme point,” explained Muro. San Jose’s success is notable because its particular confluence of factors makes it one of few success stories. During the period between 2004 and 2015, the researchers saw that even the most productive areas of the U. S. couldn’t escape the productivity slowdown, unless the area was the site of the energy or tech boom. Beyond those two sectors, only small cities that had major research universities saw productivity growth of greater than 1 percent a year. Annual Productivity Growth in U. S. Cities, These findings run contrary to the economic theory that regions will converge in productivity, which holds that low productivity regions will catch up over time by importing the skills or technologies of higher productivity regions. But that doesn’t seem to be occurring in the last decade, which is especially bad news for workers in the   regions, since higher productivity is associated with higher incomes, lower poverty rates, and higher living standards. “It is worrying that only small pockets of the country —  tech hubs, energy boomtowns, or college towns —  have registered productivity gains in the recent decade,” the authors say. And that’s precisely because not every place has these industries or resources that are providing the biggest boosts. “There are tough realities here,” said Muro. “However, in the past the country has changed the economic trajectory of places, whether through the distributed system of the land grant universities, or major investments in RD (think Silicon Valley’s formation). ” As for what policy makers should do, Muro and Parilla suggest policies that help with the high cost of housing in these productive regions, to remove the barrier of entry for workers to move to these highly productive cities. But more important is boosting productivity in regions that have been suffering. How to do that, though, is a much more complex question.",-0.5
"Short-seller Carson Block launches hedge fund .    Carson Block, founder of research firm Muddy Waters LLC who exposed accounting problems and wrongdoing at a slew of Chinese companies, has launched a hedge fund investment firm, a filing with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. Block’s new company, Muddy Waters Capital LLC, combines activism with   strategies but with an emphasis on betting against companies, the SEC filing said. Block, who according to the filing received an initial investment of $100 million, had been contemplating a hedge fund for several years.  Block follows in the footsteps of short sellers such as Jim Chanos, whose Kynikos Associates manages about $6 billion.  Block made his mark in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry after he challenged accounting practices of a number of Chinese companies that trade on North American stock exchanges, then bet against them using his own money to short their stocks. One of the companies to which Block drew attention was   Corp [SCLC. UL] a   Chinese company whose shares fell 74 percent before it eventually filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2012. Block’s original Muddy Waters firm specialized in   research that he distributed free of charge. Block is going to continue distributing free research, a source familiar with the situation said. Block’s original firm had been making money by trading its principals’ own capital, meaning Block had put his dollars behind his work. Muddy Waters Capital hired Matijn Rasser, who spent over 10 year as an intelligence officer with the U. S. government as the new firm’s chief of staff. It also hired Jamie Brown, formerly of Standard Pacific Capital and PwC, as chief financial officer and chief operating officer, the filing said.

"DOJ subpoenas airlines over keeping ticket prices high. Washington (CNN) The Justice Department has sent subpoenas to several major airlines as part of an investigation into ”possible unlawful coordination” to limit capacity increases, and thereby keeping ticket prices high, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday.  The department sent civil investigative demand letters to airlines on Tuesday, Justice spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.  At issue is whether different airlines are coordinating to keep capacity    the number of seats available on planes    stable, having the effect of keeping ticket prices high.  How the airlines have coordinated isn’t immediately clear, but among the evidence that investigators is considering includes public comments by airline executives and industry analysts.  In recent years, the Justice Department allowed two major airline mergers to take place    including United and Continental, as well as American and U. S. Airways. Industry groups have cited the merging of airlines as an example of the business has gotten tougher for consumers.  ”If not for the radical consolidation we have seen in the airline industry in the last few years, we probably would not even be having this conversation. Now that four carriers control 85 percent of domestic routes, ’collusion’ is a thought that’s constantly going to be in the back of the minds of federal regulators,” U. S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow said in a statement.  A United Airlines spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the airline has received a letter from the DOJ ”and we are complying with their requests.”  American Airlines said they also had received notice from the Justice Department. ”We welcome the review . .. Demand has been enabled by a robust and competitive marketplace in which capacity has been added and average fares have decreased,” a spokesperson for American Airlines said. ”We will cooperate fully with the investigation and demonstrate that the last two years have presented an entirely new competitive landscape that has greatly benefited air travel consumers.”  A spokesperson from Southwest Airlines confirmed receiving notice from Justice and said, ”We’ll cooperate fully in answering any questions the (Justice Department) has of us.”  JetBlue said they have not been contacted for the investigation.

"North Korea fires three ballistic missiles as G20 leaders meet in China.  North Korea fired three ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast on Monday, the South Korean and U. S. militaries said, as the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies held a summit in China, the North’s main diplomatic ally. The missiles were fired from a region south of the capital Pyongyang just after noon (10. 00 p. m. ET) and flew about 1, 000 km (600 miles) hitting Japan’s air defense identification zone, South Korea’s Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. ”We are still analyzing details but this is a grave threat to our nation’s security, and we express deep concern,” the Japan Defence Ministry said in a statement. The launches drew immediate condemnation from the United States, which described them as ”reckless,” and diplomats said the U. N. Security Council will discuss them behind closed doors on Tuesday at Washington’s and Tokyo’s requests. The missile launches were the latest in a series by the isolated North this year in violation of U. N. Security Council resolutions, supported by China, that ban all ballistic   activities by the North. Pyongyang rejects the ban as infringing its sovereign right to pursue a space program and self defense. Shortly after the missile launches, South Korean President Park   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on the sidelines of the G20 summit and agreed to cooperate on monitoring the situation, a Japanese statement said. The South’s military said the missiles were     launched as a show of force timed to coincide with the G20 summit. The U. S. Strategic Command said in a statement that two of the three were presumed to be ”intermediate range” ballistic missiles and that the third was still being assessed. In 2014, the North fired two Rodong   missiles just as Park and Abe were meeting U. S. President Barack Obama at the Hague to discuss responding to the North’s arms program.  The latest missiles were launched from a region called Hwangju and came just hours after the leaders of South Korea and China met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China.  South Korea’s Park told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the North’s fourth nuclear test and its ballistic missile launches this year threatened regional peace and posed a challenge to South Korea’s ties with China, Yonhap news agency reported earlier. During the meeting, Xi reaffirmed China’s commitment to realizing the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, China’s state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. Xi also told Park that Beijing opposed the proposed deployment of a THAAD   system in South Korea, which Seoul and the United States have said is designed to counter an increasing missile threat from North Korea. Park said that a THAAD deployment would not threaten any other country’s security interests and would not be needed if the North’s nuclear issue was resolved, Yonhap news agency said. The United States ”strongly” condemned the latest missile launches and called on North Korea to refrain from actions and rhetoric that raise tensions in the region, U. S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. ”Today’s reckless launches by North Korea threaten civil aviation and maritime commerce in the region,” Kirby said, saying the United States would raise its concerns at the United Nations as well as at this week’s East Asia Summit in Laos. ”Our commitment to the defense of our allies in the face of these threats remains ironclad,” Kirby added in a reference to U. S. treaty allies South Korea and Japan. In July, the North launched three missiles in a single day from the western region that flew across the country and into the sea off its east coast, flying about 500 km and 600 km (  miles).

"Almost half the world will be online by end of 2016; poorer countries will lag, report shows.  By the end of 2016, almost half of the world’s population will be using the internet as mobile networks grow and prices fall, but their numbers will remain concentrated in the developed world, a United Nations agency said on Tuesday.  In the world’s developed countries about 80 percent of the population use the internet. But only about 40 percent in developing countries and less than 15 percent in   countries are online, according to a report by the U. N.’s International Telecommunications Union (ITU).  In several of Africa’s poorer and more fragile countries, only one person in 10 is on the internet. The offline population is female, elderly, less educated, poorer and lives in rural areas, said the union, a specialized agency for information and communication technologies. Globally, 47 percent of the world’s population is online, still far short of a U. N. target of 60 percent by 2020. Some 3. 9 billion people, more than half the world’s population, are not. ITU expects 3. 5 billion people to have access by the end of this year. ”In 2016, people no longer go online, they are online.

"GOP, Dems put more money into Montana special election | TheHill. Democratic and Republicans groups are both making big investments in Montana’s closely watched special election for an at-large House seat. The money comes as Democrats look to flip the seat once held by President Trump's Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, following two surprisingly close special elections in Kansas and Georgia. Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a GOP super PAC allied with House leadership, is putting an additional $500,000 into the special election for a mail campaign and 50 canvassers in the field on top of its $1.5 million television investment. The group on Wednesday also launched a new ad that hits the Democrat nominee, musician Rob Quist, over personal financial troubles, an issue that has plagued the candidate in his run for Congress against Republican businessman Greg GianforteGregory Richard GianforteHouse Democrats targeting six more Trump districts for 2020  House GOP fears retirement wave will lead to tsunami Trump declares Gorka 'wins big' after clash with reporters in Rose Garden MORE. “How can we trust Quist with our tax dollars?” the narrator asks at the end of the 30-second ad that lists several of Quist’s financial difficulties. “Rob Quist’s track record is one mistruth after another. Rob not only failed to pay his taxes time and again, but also stiffed fellow Montanans,” said the group’s executive director, Corey Bliss. “Quist’s history of dishonesty and turning his back on hard-working Montanans is what’s damning and a clear sign he can’t be trusted. Montanans will soon reject him and his dishonest ways, and Quist will have no one to blame but himself.” But Democrats, seeking to be competitive in traditionally Republican districts in the era of President Trump, are also upping their financial efforts. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, announced a $400,000 effort Wednesday for both television and a mail campaign, which follows last month’s investment of $200,000. “Rob Quist is a Montana native who understands the struggles of hardworking families in the state, while Gianforte is singularly focused on supporting special interests, wealthy landowners and millionaires like himself,” communications director Meredith Kelly said in a statement. “This significant investment in television and ground game will bolster Quist’s already strong, Montana-focused campaign.” DCCC's money comes after Washington Democrats were criticized for not putting more money into the Kansas special election, which the Democratic nominee lost despite making the race more competitive. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has also put a financial stake in Montana, announcing a six-figure investment last month to aid Quist’s bid. Democrats want to turn the red-state race into proof of a coming 2018 midterms backlash, hoping that a surprise Democratic win could prompt GOP retirements and divide the Republican caucus. Montana’s May 25 special election follows a strong performance for Democrats in Georgia last month, where Democrat Jon Ossoff just missed the 50 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff.

"Ryan, top Republicans urge caution on post-Orlando gun control measures.  House Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans pushed back Thursday on growing calls from Democrats to ban people on terror watch lists from buying guns, even as Donald Trump and other GOP figures opened the door to discussing it. Calls for action have increased in the wake of the terror massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that left 50 people, including the gunman, dead on Sunday. The gunman, Omar Mateen, had been on a watch list for 10 months before being removed. “We want to make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again. Everybody wants that,” Ryan told reporters Thursday. ”But as we look at how to proceed, we also want to make sure that we’re not infringing upon people’s legitimate constitutional rights. That’s important. ”  Ryan’s comments come a day after Trump indicated potential support for new gun laws in this area.  “I will be meeting with the N. R. A. who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the   list, to buy guns,” the presumptive GOP presidential nominee tweeted Wednesday. Whether Trump would support an outright ban or just a delay for gun sales for those on watch lists is not clear. That is the sticking point right now in the Senate.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  . and other Democrats are pushing a measure to ban those on   lists from purchasing weapons.   But Republicans worry about such a measure infringing on gun rights for someone wrongly included on such a list.  Sen. John Cornyn,   has a dueling measure to delay a gun sale for 72 hours, but require prosecutors to go to court to show probable cause if they want to block the sale permanently. Cornyn’s bill has been backed by the NRA. Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Charles Grassley, of Iowa, and Ted Cruz, of Texas, have a measure that would notify law enforcement if anyone investigated for terrorism in the last five years tries to buy a gun    in addition to making other changes.  Democrats drew more attention to their version of the legislation Wednesday night as Sen. Chris Murphy,  . held the floor along with colleagues in a nearly   filibuster that lasted into the early hours Thursday.  ”We can’t just wait, we have to make something happen,” said Sen. Cory Booker,  . J. at an emotional news conference where Democrats joined family members of people killed in the nation’s recent mass shootings. ”These are people bound by brutality, and their numbers are growing.” But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,  . blasted Murphy’s filibuster as a ”campaign   ” that did nothing but delay potential votes. Cruz also slammed Democrats, saying on the Senate floor the Democrat effort was nothing more than a political distraction that avoided the real issues. “I find it ridiculous that in response to an ISIS terror attack, the Democrats go on high dudgeon that we’ve got to restrict the Second Amendment rights of   citizens,” Cruz said. “This is not a gun control issue, this is a terrorism issue. ” Sen. Chuck Schumer,  . Y. called Cornyn’s bill a ”wolf in sheep’s clothing” and said it would allow ”every terrorist to get a gun.” Clinton’s spokesman, Brian Fallon, called Cornyn’s bill a ”smokescreen.” Cornyn responded angrily. ”That’s an incredibly ignorant thing for her to say,” Cornyn said. ”That anybody can be denied their constitutional rights without due process of law and without the government coming forward and establishing probable cause, that’s simply  .” A possible bipartisan compromise was proposed by Sen. Pat Toomey,  . Toomey said Wednesday his bill would prevent potential terrorists from getting a gun, while providing an extra layer of due process that the Democratic bill lacks. “I have drafted legislation that takes the best features from both of the previous proposals, effectively preventing terrorists from being able to purchase guns, while also safeguarding the rights of innocent Americans who are mistakenly put on the list,” Toomey said. Meanwhile, the Justice Department backed a ban on gun sales to those on watch lists.  “The amendment gives the Justice Department an important additional tool to prevent the sale of guns to suspected terrorists by licensed firearms dealers while ensuring protection of the department’s operational and investigative sensitivities,” a DOJ official said in a statement.  The DOJ’s stance is a departure from past warnings from FBI Director James Comey, who reportedly has said a ban could alert terrorists they are being investigated.  Ryan cited those remarks when talking to reporters. “As the FBI director just told us the other day, and I think he said this publicly, if we do this wrong, like the president is proposing, we can actually blow our ongoing terrorist investigations. So, we want to get this right, so that we don’t undermine terrorist investigations,” Ryan said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.   ",1.0
"Mattis threatens Nato with reduced US support over defence spending. The new US defence secretary has delivered an ultimatum to Nato allies, saying they must either honour military spending pledges or face the prospect of America “moderating” its commitment to the transatlantic organisation. James Mattis issued the warning to the other 27 members of the alliance on Wednesday during a closed session at Nato headquarters in Brussels on his first visit to Europe as a senior member of Donald Trump’s cabinet. Mattis’s predecessors have made similar threats over the last decade during visits to Nato, but without the same conviction. “I owe it to you to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country’s people in concrete terms,” he said. “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defence. ” Trump repeatedly said on the campaign trail last year that it was time for European countries to stump up a fair share for an organisation he denounced as “obsolete”. He created alarm among other Nato members when he said the US might not automatically come to the defence of a fellow member under attack. Only five of the 28 members meet Nato’s target of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence: the US, the UK, Poland, Greece and Estonia. The US spends 3. 6% on defence and the UK 2. 2% based on Nato figures for 2016, while Germany spends 1. 1% France 1. 7% Italy 1. 1% and Spain 0. 9%. Mattis did not spell out what he meant by “moderating” support.  The Obama administration, in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, reversed US troop withdrawals from Europe and began the biggest deployment since the end of the cold war, with the first of 4, 000 extra troops arriving in Poland in January.  On Wednesday Mattis said he wanted Nato to adopt a plan with new target dates for meeting at least the 2% target and that the plan should be in place by next year.  Earlier he expressed support for the alliance, saying it was a “fundamental bedrock” of US defence policy. Against a backdrop of fresh scrutiny over the new US administration’s alleged links to Russia, he claimed this support was backed by his boss, saying Trump had “strong support for Nato”.  But Mattis also told the meeting of defence ministers: “No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defence of western values. Americans cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do. ” Mattis tried to make his case by citing the threat from Moscow, noting the annexation of Crimea and Islamic State’s hold over parts of Iraq and Syria, and saying that “some in this alliance have looked away in denial of what is happening”. “Despite the threats from the east and south, we have failed to fill gaps in our Nato response force or to adapt,” he added. Mattis will attend the Munich security conference at the weekend on a visit that will offer another opportunity for European defence and security ministers to try to gauge the Trump administration’s plans. On the campaign trail Trump repeatedly claimed that the US was paying 75%of Nato’s costs because European countries, struggling with domestic spending problems, were unwilling to contribute their share.  Although the US and UK use the yardstick of 2% of GDP, the running costs of Nato shared by all 28 members in 2016 amounted to about $2bn (£1. 6bn). While the US was the biggest contributor, this amounted to significantly less than Trump’s claimed 75%. The US paid 22% of the common running costs, Germany 14. 6% France 10. 6% and Spain 5. 7%.  The UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who was at the meeting and supports the push for other countries to raise defence spending to 2% said Mattis had explained that “the impatience of the American taxpayer is a reality”. On Tuesday, the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank said in its annual military balance report that UK defence spending had fallen to 1. 98% in 2016. The UK Ministry of Defence disputed this.",-0.5
"Australian property prices are cooling and household debt is high, but that's no problem: HSBC. Aussies have some of the world's highest debt levels, and property prices are finally cooling. But investors fearing a U.S-style credit crisis needn't worry, according to a new report from HSBC. As Canberra reoriented economic growth away from mining and towards services, a housing construction boom began, leading to a 30 percent increase in home prices since mid-2012 and making Australia one of the world's least affordable property markets. As a result, the household debt-to-income ratio jumped from 167 percent in 2011 to 186 percent in 2015, HSBC said. ""This makes Australian household debt levels amongst the highest in the developed world."" The rise in home prices slightly softened the household debt-to-asset ratio, which fell from 24 percent in 2011 to 22 percent in 2015. But as the market beings to cool, that raises questions about the sustainability of household debt, the bank said. National housing prices have been steady over the past six months, with the slowdown most reflected in major cities. In Sydney and Melbourne, prices have been flat since October, following annual average growth of 10 and 6 percent respectively, over the previous four years, HSBC noted. The bank forecasts national housing price growth to run at low single-digit rates this year and into 2017, following growth of about 10 percent in 2015, on the back of over-supply. That could increase the household debt-to-asset ratio, leaving residents vulnerable to external shocks. But Australia's case is manageable because it has good distribution of debt, unlike the U.S. pre-global financial crisis, HSBC explained. ""It is unusual for the high debt levels, in themselves, to be the driver of a downturn... Importantly though, even in the U.S., it was not the level of aggregate debt that mattered most, but the distribution of debt."" The bulk of Australian debt is held by higher income households, with 2010 data revealing 72 percent of household debt was held by the top 40 percent of income earners, HSBC said. The lowest 20 percent of earners held less than 4 percent of the debt, it added. Moreover, Australia's financial system has institutional features that help to reduce any risk of a crisis. ""For a start, all mortgages are full recourse. Australia's tax system also favors paying down mortgages ahead of schedule as interest payments and expenses on owner-occupied properties are not tax-deductible,"" HSBC said. Full recourse means that lenders can pursue a debtor's other assets to cover a loss on a loan, rather than having to write off losses on underwater loans, as occurred in many U.S. states during the credit crisis. ""The average mortgage is currently over 2.5 years pre-paid, leaving households with a significant buffer in the face of the risk of rising unemployment,"" it added. Strict lending rules have also been helpful in creating stable loan portfolios.

"Our ability to make random, “creative” choices peaks at 25. Our ability to make random choices, which are tied to bursts of creativity, peaks at the age of 25, researchers report in a new study. Why it matters: Random decision-making is a hallmark of human cognition. Scientists have known that our ability to make choices or behave without an apparent method diminishes with age but they don't know when that capacity peaks, which may inform our understanding of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. The details: 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old completed a series of online tasks that asked them to create random patterns and sequences: Participants chose hypothetical results for 12 coin flips. Five cards were presented and people in the study chose which one they thought would be at the top of the deck. They did this 10 times. People taking part were instructed to imagine rolling one die 10 times and to click on a number between one and six as randomly as possible so that if another person is shown the sequence, he or she wouldn't be able to tell whether numbers were produced by actually rolling a die or made up by somebody. They clicked 10 times in a random fashion on nine dots. Participants were instructed to make a random pattern with 9 in a grid. Using an algorithm that ranked randomness and controlling for characteristics like gender, language and education levels, the researchers found the ability to act randomly peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from there.",0.0
"Snapchat parent company files for IPO | TheHill. Snap Inc., the parent company of mobile app Snapchat, officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday afternoon. The highly anticipated IPO will be the biggest since Alibaba’s $25 billion dollar filing in 2014, which was the largest ever. Experts expect the Snap IPO’s valuation to be in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion. Some outlets are reporting estimates as high as $35 billion. The company used its filing Thursday to raise major political issues, including U.S. tax reform. “Certain changes to U.S. tax laws ... could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash-equivalent balances we maintain outside the United States,"" Snap wrote under the risk factors portion of their SEC filing. “Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay and seriously harm our business."" Tax reform has been a concern for many in the tech industry, with tech leaders calling it a priority for discussion when entering a meeting with Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE, then the president-elect, in December. Apple CEO Tim Cook also met with lawmakers in January to discuss tax policy, among other topics. Snap also raised the Brexit as another concern in its filing Thursday, saying the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union could “seriously harm"" its business. “The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom,” the filing read. The company opened its first European office in London earlier in the month. According to the Thursday filing, Morgan Stanley is the lead underwriter, alongside Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Allen & Company. Snap will only offer Class A shares in the offering, which don’t have shareholder votes. The move is in step with many large tech companies taking precautions to retain high levels of control after going public. Facebook’s shares are structured in a manner that protects founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stake in the company. Google made similar provisions in its 2004 IPO. Snap's SEC filing did not specify the number of shares that would be issued and shares will not pay dividends. Updated at 5:57 p.m. View the discussion thread.

"Supreme Court orders closer look at credit card surcharge laws | TheHill. The Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously ordered a lower court to take another look at laws that ban merchants from describing the higher price they charge when customers pay with a credit card instead of cash as a “credit card surcharge.” Under the law in New York and other states, merchants must describe the difference as a “cash discount.” In delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said the the law regulates speech, as the merchants argued it did, but sent the case back to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to decide whether it is unconstitutional.  “Each time one of their customers pays with a credit card, these merchants must pay some transaction fee to the company that issued the credit card. The fee is generally two to three percent of the purchase price,” Roberts explained in his opinion. “Those fees add up, and the merchants allege that they pay tens of thousands of dollars every year to credit card companies. Rather than increase prices across the board to absorb those costs, the merchants want to pass the fees along only to their customers who choose to use credit cards. They also want to make clear that they are not the bad guys — that the credit card companies, not the merchants, are responsible for the higher prices.” View the discussion thread.

"New OMB director can help improve government efficiency | TheHill. President-elect Donald TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s decision to name conservative budget hawk Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) director of the Office of Management and Budget is a signal that the new administration will emphasize lower government spending despite plans for sizable tax cuts and a major infrastructure program. This ambitious agenda no doubt will consume the lion’s share of the new director’s time. But, as he helps craft a new budget and grapples with fiscal policy, Mulvaney and the new president should embrace the other critical roles played by OMB that could have a huge impact on the operations of the government. OMB is a small agency — fewer than 500 employees — but its reach spans across the federal landscape. It is the only entity positioned to drive innovation, collaboration, efficiency and the use of data throughout the federal enterprise. With the potential of smaller budgets, improved management and cost-effective delivery of services will be essential. As history has demonstrated, competent management can lead to positive outcomes and a successful presidency. Missteps can derail important initiatives, lead to political fallout and increase public distrust. While the departments and agencies must be responsible for implementing policies, there are a number of areas where Trump and Mulvaney can expand current practices to greatly improve government performance, better serve the public and help themselves in the process. First, OMB should play a stronger role strengthening how government uses information and evidence to better understand whether programs and policies are getting positive results. Too often, agencies spend money based on good intentions and “guesstimates,” not on measurable evidence that programs are working as intended. OMB could help set standards for what constitutes success and identify which programs and approaches meet those standards. Second, OMB should be more proactive in removing barriers that impede change and innovation. Solving tough problems requires taking chances and that means a greater tolerance for well-founded risk-taking.  While OMB has a reputation for being ""the agency of no” because of its role protecting the president and the administration’s budget and policy priorities, it can do more to clarify where agency leaders have flexibility to test new approaches, identify areas that are off-limits, provide air cover to test new ideas without fear of reprisals and serve as an incubator for change. The Obama administration, for example, created a template for innovation by starting the United States Digital Service inside OMB, bringing in private sector technology experts to work with federal employees to improve agency online services and internal operations. OMB then helped spread this successful digital services startup model to other agencies. Third, OMB should build on current efforts to get agencies to work more closely together on many of the nation’s critical challenges. Few of the issues, such as cybersecurity, economic development, or immigration, can be solved by any single agency acting alone. Achieving many of the new administration’s priorities will require having the government operate as an integrated enterprise, rather than separate, disconnected entities. OMB could work with Congress to fund cooperative interagency efforts and help agency leaders connect and map strategies to align overlapping activities. An example of current of OMB-assisted, cross-agency coordination involves expediting the federal permitting, review and approval processes for more than 50 infrastructure projects. This has involved efforts by multiple agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation and the Army Corps of Engineers, to synchronize their work. In the state of New York, the federal permitting and review process for the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge took 1.5 years, instead of the normal three-to-five years, because of the federal coordination. While the budget will always be OMB’s most significant function, Mulvaney and Trump will have the challenge and opportunity to expand OMB’s role as a positive force in helping agencies more effectively deliver results for the American people.   Max Stier is president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, which through its Center for Presidential Transition, has worked with the presidential candidates, federal agencies, Congress and the White House to help ensure the next chief executive is prepared to govern.

"Survey says: 34 percent of Bay Area residents are ready to leave. Residents of the California's Bay Area are eyeing the exits. Some 34 percent of San Francisco-area residents are considering leaving because of high housing costs and traffic, according to a survey by the Bay Area Council. ""We can whine about this, or we can win by solving our traffic and housing problems,"" Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, told The Mercury News. ""The last time the Bay Area had seemingly solved its traffic problems was the worldwide recession of 2008. A recession is not how we want to solve our traffic and housing problems."" People who have lived in the area for five years or less are those most likely to start packing their bags, according to the report. San Franciscans with lower income and those putting more of their income toward housing expenses were also listed among those prepared to leave. Residents noted that the most serious problems facing the Bay Area included high cost of living, poverty and income inequality, crime rates and homelessness. The biggest concern for the Bay Area is the potential loss of its young labor force, though. ""These younger folks, millennials, are our future workforce; this is our labor market; this is our talent pool,"" Rufus Jeffris, vice president of communications for the Bay Area Council, told CNBC. ""So, our economy is fueled by our talent and when folks are saying that they are going to leave, that can create a real problem for us in terms of attracting and retaining the workers and talent that we need to succeed."" ""This is our canary in a coal mine,"" said Jim Wunderman, CEO of the Bay Area Council, in a statement. ""Residents are screaming for solutions. Do we expect to see more than 2 million residents up and leave? Of course not. But losing even a fraction of that number and the talent they represent because we failed to deal with our most pressing issues would be very bad."" Some 54 percent of the local population said they would remain in the area. The survey, which collected results from about 1,000 residents in the area, also revealed that citizens in the San Francisco Bay are split when it comes to how they think the region is faring. About 40 percent of respondents said that the Bay Area was on the right track, while 40 percent said it was on the wrong track. ""The economic divide in the Bay Area is real,"" Russell Hancock, president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, told The Mercury News. ""We will lose low-income earners, and they will be replaced by high earners. We are losing the middle class as well."" Read the full report from The Mercury News.",0.0
"Leo DiCaprio-Hillary Clinton Money ’Laundering’ Street Art Appears in L.A. - Breitbart. Provocative Los   street artist Sabo has set his sights on Leonardo DiCaprio and Hillary Clinton, satirizing their respective charitable foundations and turning them into   enterprises in a series of new posters that have been put up in Los Angeles. [The   Revenant actor and founder of the   Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation was set to host the Democratic presidential candidate at his Los Angeles home for a   lunch fundraiser on Tuesday, but said a scheduling conflict had prevented him from hosting the event. Pop star Justin Timberlake and his wife, actress Jessica Biel, will host the event instead.  Last week, reports surfaced that DiCaprio’s foundation is alleged to have received donations from funds tied to a $3 billion Malaysian embezzlement scheme. Meanwhile, Clinton has been dogged by a steady stream of revelations that she allegedly used her position as Secretary of State to grant preferential treatment and special access to major Clinton Foundation donors. Sabo  —   who has a history of lambasting liberal politicians and Hollywood actors with his art  —   let loose with his latest piece, which sees the heads of both DiCaprio and Clinton spinning around in stacked clothes dryers with $100 bills swirling all around them. One of the washing machines reads: “The Clinton Crime Family: Laundering Money Since 1997. ” “Bernie sold out for a lake house! !!” reads another, referencing Clinton’s presidential primary challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sabo wanted to place the his   artwork near the actor’s home, but was thwarted by security. While working anonymously to roast Hollywood liberals, Sabo’s art has seemingly been seen everywhere as of late. Last week, he altered Fox Searchlight’s upcoming slave epic Birth of a Nation film posters to read “Rapist?” after the film’s star Nate Parker’s 1990s sexual assault case resurfaced.

"Jeff Sessions’ office accused of prosecutorial misconduct in the ’90s.  (CNN) As Sen. Jeff Sessions awaits a confirmation hearing in hopes of becoming the next US attorney general, a blistering legal opinion on a case he oversaw as Alabama’s top prosecutor two decades ago could emerge as an issue for the nominee.  The 1997 ”order and opinion” by an Alabama judge accused the state attorney general’s office, which had been headed by Sessions, of the worst prosecutorial misconduct he’d ever seen.  ”The court finds that even having been given every benefit of the doubt, the misconduct of the Attorney General in this case far surpasses in both extensiveness and measure the totality of any prosecutorial misconduct ever previously presented to or witnessed by this court,” wrote James S. Garrett, a Jefferson County Circuit Court judge.  The misconduct was ”so pronounced and persistent,” Garrett wrote, that ”it permeates the entire atmosphere of this prosecution.”  As a result, Garrett dismissed the case, which, according to the judge’s order, had earlier been heralded by Sessions’ office as being ”of the greatest magnitude” it had undertaken in the past 25 years.  Sessions did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. He also did not mention the case on a questionnaire he submitted ahead of his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing, which included a section for ”most significant litigated matters.”  At the time of the judge’s order, Sessions told the Associated Press ”the allegations in the order are unfounded and without merit.”  He has previously said Garrett should have let the case go to trial and should not have used such inflammatory language in his order.  ”I have a bit of philosophy about it,” Sessions told the Montgomery Advertiser two days after the ruling was issued. ”Judges have got to watch this, because if prosecutors are continued to be abused by defense lawyers, it can chill their willingness to take on high profile, complex cases.”  The Alabama Ethics Commission investigated Sessions’ role in the case after the owner of the indicted company submitted a complaint.  The case was dismissed based on ”insufficient facts,” an ethics commission spokesperson told CNN.  A subsequent appellate court ruling having to do with a related civil case called Garrett’s order ”unreliable and misleading.” The appellate justices noted that Garrett’s harshly worded opinion was based, in part, on a statement of facts provided by defense counsel in the case.  Garrett acknowledged in his order that he reviewed defense counsels’ statement of facts which he found ”thoroughly and extensively documented” as well ”accurate and correct.” He wrote that he adopted them for the basis of his findings and conclusions contained in the order.   The case at issue stemmed from the attorney general’s criminal prosecution of Tieco, Inc. a Birmingham,   turf and industrial equipment company. Sessions’ office accused Tieco and some of its officers of cheating customers and suppliers through bogus billings and kickbacks.  The case was initiated based on a complaint to the attorney general’s office by an attorney representing ”an apparent competitor” of Tieco, according to Garrett’s order.  The judge noted that the complaint could have been motivated by a competitor’s desire to ”gain a business advantage” and that ”should have been a possibility the Attorney General’s office should have considered in its investigation.”  The judge wrote that he was ”somewhat curious” and ”puzzled” by similarities between language in the search warrant affidavit filed by Sessions’ office in the criminal case and a subsequent civil court complaint filed against Tieco.  J. Mark White, an attorney for Tieco in the criminal case, told CNN the attorney general’s office cooperated with a company that later sued Tieco in civil court.  ”I have never seen a case before like this where the government used its police powers to assist a civil case,” White said. ”There should be a bright line between how civil and criminal cases are handled.”   A year after the   indictments, Garrett found that the case was rife with prosecutorial misconduct, including failures to turn over exculpatory evidence, deceptive testimony by assistants or agents of the Attorney General and ”flagrant disregard of the constitutional rights of those accused.”  ”This court can only conclude it is dealing with either intentional and deliberate misconduct or conduct so reckless and improper as to constitute conscious disregard for the lawful duties of the Attorney General and the integrity and dignity of this court and this Judge.”  Sessions stepped down as Attorney General after being elected to the Senate in 1996.  He did so before Judge Garret’s opinion was issued in 1997. His successor, Bill Pryor, did not appeal Garrett’s ruling. ",-1.0
"Fyre Festival Hit With Third Lawsuit (And A Madcap Comedy Spoof). One week ago around this time, thousands of people seeking a luxurious island reprieve were preparing for a trip to Exuma Island in the Bahamas to attend the Fyre Festival. In the time since, two lawsuits seeking class action certification against the organizers of the disastrous event  —   and the models that promoted it  —   have been filed. Until today, when a third joined them. The suit, filed by two Fyre festival goers in New York’s federal Southern District Court yesterday, covers much of the same ground as the first, citing social media posts of poor conditions and a Wall Street Journal report on its failure to pay performers. Filed this past Sunday, the new suit also names Grant Margolin, the event’s marketing director, as a defendant and alleges negligence, fraud and misrepresentation and violation of the consumer protection laws of all 50 states (included in order to cover anyone who would join the suit if it is certified as a class action). A section titled ”Plaintiff’s Experience” should be familiar at this point to anyone who has paid attention thus far. Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello each paid $1, 027 for their tickets, meant to cover travel and luxury lodging at the event. Herlihy and Lauriello also deposited $900 and $1, 000 respectively onto electronic wristbands for purchases they would make at the festival, money neither has yet received. As well, Lauriello’s headphones, jeans and sneakers were stolen due to the lack of security at the event. Now that three putative class actions have been filed, two in California and now one in New York, it remains to be seen which, if any, will be certified as such, or whether the thousands of people who purchased tickets will have to bring individual actions. As well, the defendants targeted more specifically in a suit brought this past Tuesday also leaves open the possibility that the social media ”influencers” who promoted the festival  —   Kendall Jenner, for example, was paid $250, 000 while payments to others began at $10, 000 according to a report from Billboard today  —   could also be on the hook. The whole thing was such a debacle that it spurred the writer Jordan VanDina to pen a spoof comedy script (that is extensively explicit and lewd  —   and funny) starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, the magician David Blaine and the actor Kevin Connolly, best known for playing ”E” on the HBO series Entourage. The script, a   buddy romp, brings in Donald Trump, Pitbull, the band Eiffel 65 (responsible for the 1999 earworm ”Blue (Da Ba Dee)”) Kendall Jenner and the poor customer service department of United Airlines. While fiction, it’s also not such a huge stretch  —   especially the part where festival goers,   desperately seek phone chargers.",-0.5
"Member of group that used Grindr to find and assault gay men gets 15 years – TechCrunch. The first sentencing has been handed down in a Texas case centered on the use of Grindr as a platform from which to perpetrate hate crimes. Nigel Garrett was given 15 years yesterday after pleading guilty to a list of crimes including assault, carjacking, and use of firearms, the Tyler Morning Telegraph reported. Garrett, and three accomplices admitted in August to having arranged on the dating app for gay men to meet victims at their homes in several Texas cities, where they would tie them up, assault and rob them. The accomplices await sentencing (the maximum is life). These crimes ought to be of interest to the tech world because they are very much enabled by tech. While of course assaults against people because of their race, sexual orientation, religion and so on are obviously possible (and frequent) without the aid of an app, something like Grindr exemplifies the risk of having that information accessible instantly to anyone. On the other hand, the nature of the apps also means that there is a wealth of evidence in a case like Garrett’s that the crimes were specifically targeted at a population. There’s no doubt that these men targeted people of a certain sexual orientation, as there might be in a street assault. “Hate crimes are violent crimes, but also attack the fundamental principles of the United States,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore in a statement in August. Those principles are increasingly being tested and abused online, so it’s good to see these digitally-enabled crimes pursued aggressively. The trail of digital clues, such as app and phone records, was no doubt crucial to building a strong case, and will be in more and more investigations going forward. I’ve asked Grinder for comment on what if anything it can do (or has done) to prevent crimes like this or aid in their resolution. Notably this case was pursued by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which has been attempting to crack down on hate crimes recently.",0.0
"AmEx shares fall as 2016 earnings outlook disappoints. AmEx shares fell about 3. 7 percent to $60. 35 in extended trading following the company’s 2016 earnings forecast of $5. $5. 70 per share. Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, said while the new guidance for 2016 is above consensus earnings estimates, it includes an expected $1 billion gain on the sale of Costco portfolio, which implies that underlying growth in 2016 will be ”weaker than expected, not stronger.” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault did not specify he size of the expected gain from the Costco portfolio sale during the company’s earnings conference call.  Nomura Securities analyst Bill Carcache said some investors stripped about $0. 66 a share off the expected earnings per share for the year to account for the gain. Analysts on an average estimate 2016 earnings of $5. 41 per share, according to Thomson Reuters    . AmEx lost   partners such as Fidelity Investments, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp ( ) and JetBlue Airways Corp ( ) last year. The company also said it would cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017 as it responds to intensifying competition in the payments industry. ”Our 2015 results and outlook reflect the reset in   economics, pressures on merchant fees, the evolving regulatory environment and intense competition that have been   the payments industry,” Chenault said in a statement. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $873 million or 89 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1. 44 billion or $1. 39 per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $335 million   charge and the   period a $453 million   gain. AmEx reported its fourth straight decline in total revenue, net of interest expense, of $8. 39 billion. Adjusted revenue rose 4 percent. Shares of the company, which had fallen about 10 percent this year to Thursday close, lost a quarter of their value in 2015.

"Korean détente a positive but limited step forward. South and North Korea currently are enjoying a limited détente. But their seeming embrace, with plans for a unified Olympics team, is a symbolic act unlikely on its own to  reshape U.S. policy. South Korean President Moon Jae-in planned to resume the so-called Sunshine Policy, which uses cash and aid to leaven engagement with the North, until Pyongyang’s aggressive rhetoric and accelerated weapons testing forced him to change course. Now Kim Jong-un’s call for dialogue has resurrected his original plans. President Trump’s cascade of threats encouraged Kim to engage Moon and help pull the South away from the Trump administration, citing U.S. ""hostility."" The result has been to reinforce Seoul’s already firm opposition to U.S. military action, which the South fears could trigger a Second Korean War. At the end of the day: Contact between the U.S. and North Korea is essential to a permanent solution. Unfortunately, the Trump administration remains intransigent, pressing the DPRK to concede the main issue at stake before talks can be held — a nonstarter — and leaving the threat of war looming.

"British pound plunges as Brexit fears continue to swirl. The British pound plunged to fresh 31-year lows on Wednesday, swamped by continued fears over the U.K. leadership vacuum and the country's potential exit from the European Union (EU). The pound tumbled as low as $1.2796 during Asia trade on Wednesday, it's lowest since 1985, after ending Tuesday's trade around $1.2960. The U.K. currency later recovered to trade around $1.291 at the close of European stock markets. Analysts were concerned that the continued political uncertainty will hurt capital inflows and spur companies to delay investments, potentially tipping the economy into a recession. The Bank of England (BOE) had begun taking preemptive steps to protect the British economy in the wake of June 23 U.K. referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU). On Tuesday, BOE Governor Mark Carney sent a clear message to Britain's cautious bankers: They needed to start lending more money. The central bank cut the amount of capital it required banks to hold in reserve, which freed up an extra 150 billion pounds ($196 billion) for lending. Carney had previously signaled more monetary easing would likely be put in place in the near term. But that wasn't assuaging the market much, analysts said. ""As Carney as put it himself, there isn't so much he can do. Monetary policy, which the Bank of England is in charge of, cannot fix structural issues. It's very apparent with Brexit that investors will stay away from the U.K. because of the certainty,"" Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments, told CNBC's ""Rundown"" on Wednesday. He noted that not only has the U.K. yet to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which will formally start negotiations for an exit from the EU, it wasn't clear who the country's next leader would be. The ruling Conservative party is in the midst of finding a successor to Prime Minister David Cameron, who resigned after his ""remain"" camp lost the referendum. ""You're not going to make a big investment decision if you don't have that sort of certainty,"" Merk said. ""The only thing the Bank of England can do obviously is provide the ability of banks to lend, but if there are no takers, it doesn't help all that much."" Many analysts have said they expect sterling to keep retreating in the wake of the Brexit vote. ""I don't think the markets are in any way, shape or form done with the downside in the sterling,"" Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Wednesday. ""We still think that $1.20 is a not unreasonable target given the size of effective like terms of trade shock,"" he said. ""It's like Australia running out of gas or Saudi Arabia running out of oil, particularly in terms of how the financial services sector is potentially going to be impacted."" Another burn to investor faith in sterling came from three British real estate funds — Standard Life, Aviva and M&G Investments — halting dealing in their U.K. property funds, leaving investors and fund managers worried about consequences on the broader sector. In recent years, foreign investors had snapped up property in Britain, particularly in London, partly due to expectations that the country's politics and its currency would remain stable. Foreign investors faced a drop in the value of those investments in their home-currency terms amid the pound's plunge. Goldman Sachs expected another leg of pound weakness, or ""ample downside,"" pointing toward the BOE's monetary policy meeting next week, where it anticipated further guidance on likely easing measures, which may include reinstating quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases. ""This will be the catalyst for a further downward move in sterling,"" Goldman said in a note Wednesday. ""The market is not discounting the easing effect of asset purchases, the persistence of easier monetary conditions in the U.K., and the U.S.-U.K. monetary policy divergence that we expect nearly as much as it should,"" it said. U.S. interest rates remain in positive territory and many analysts still expected the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates at least one time this year.

"Paul Ryan is out. So now what?—commentary. Has the GOP already accepted defeat in this presidential election? It sure seems like it. And that means a long overdue reformation of the party is in order. I'm not sure this even needs to be said anymore, but here it is: Donald Trump will not, cannot, and simply has no chance to win the presidential election. His inability to tamp down his divisive rhetoric tells us this. His blundering and inexperienced campaign team tells us this. And most importantly, his failure to overtake even the astoundingly weak Hillary Clinton in 27 straight general election polls now tells us this. The problem is, he's still going to walk into the Republican National Convention in July with the most delegates of any of the GOP presidential candidates. And House Speaker Paul Ryan's convincing announcement that he will not run for president seems to be negating not only Ryan as a late-arriving savior but just about everyone else who might come late to this party as a compromise candidate. Hard-core political types can often be out of touch and ideologically delusional, but one thing every politician knows how to do is read the darn polls. And Trump's polls are historically weak for any frontrunner for either party's presidential nomination this far out from the general election. Even monumental general election losers like Walter Mondale in 1984 and Michael Dukakis in 1988 led in at least a few polls at this stage in the election calendar. For Trump not only to be behind in every poll, but down by double digits in almost all them, presages what looks like a 40-state/400+ electoral vote landslide for the almost-just-as-disliked Clinton. There is still a good chance that an energetic and dramatic contested convention will give the Republicans and the eventual nominee a great shot in the arm and shake up the election. But even an epic 100-plus ballot victory could not boost Trump over his massive negative ratings. And Ted Cruz is not really doing that much better in the polls vs. Clinton on top of the fact that he, too, is virtually impossible to rebrand. The immediate plan to stage a truly contested convention gives the GOP a puncher's chance to win in November, but that's it. Now that Ryan has bowed out, the GOP's chances are slim and none ... and slim just walked out the door. But the news isn't all bad for Republicans. Landslide electoral losses are tough pills to swallow, but they are so much more instructive than the relatively close presidential elections that have been the norm over the last 16 years. Election returns are like earnings reports: If they can be fudged or manipulated because they're not very clear, they don't hold much informative value to truly curious investors. And when your party keeps winning or even losing close elections, you can convince yourself that only a small tweak here and there is needed. But lose three 400-plus electoral vote elections in a row like the Democrats did in 1980, 1984, and 1988, and you get a much-needed soul searching. That process brought the Democrats to Bill Clinton, who took the party away from its ruinous anti-business path and made the party relevant again. The Republicans are long overdue for such a revamp. Some may think Trump is that reformer, but a change in message and candidate that ends up weakening your party in the polls is clearly not the answer. Speaker Ryan hinted at some of what that new answer might sound like at his news conference on Tuesday and it sure seemed like a lot more of an electable message than what we tend to hear from Trump and Cruz. It was a lot more conciliatory and focused on enacting economic policies that actually work. It left the wedge issues, religion, and insults out of it. In the stock market, when the bulls have all finally given up on a pipe dream of a rally, we call it ""capitulation."" It's a rough process, but it signals the beginning of renewal. Ryan's hints at capitulation yesterday similarly are not the harbinger of the death of the Republican Party, but its rebirth. Commentary by Jake Novak, supervising producer of ""Power Lunch.""

"Social Media SLAMS #WILLFERRELL for Reagan Alzheimer’s Comedy. Will Ferrell came under intense fire on social media Thursday after Variety reported that the actor has been tapped to star as President Reagan in a comedy film that spoofs the 40th president’s Alzheimer’s disease.

"Danny DeVito: NC’s Bathroom Law Treats Transgenders as ’Second-Class Citizens’. Danny DeVito called North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act a “ridiculous” law from a state full of people who do not “understand what humanity is. ”[“Oh my god, it’s ridiculous. North Carolina is basically a pariah now,” the    told The Daily Beast. These people don’t understand what humanity is. They don’t have an evolutionary bone in their body. ”  DeVito is the latest liberal luminary to chime in on North Carolina’s   “bathroom bill. ” “I think the people of North Carolina need to rise up against all this legislation, because it’s ludicrous to be discriminating against folks,” he said. North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act removes discrimination protection from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in public facilities. The law has caused some controversy because it forbids transgender men and boys from using women’s public bathrooms and locker rooms if they   as female. The law also bars local governments from granting transgender people the right to use whatever public facilities they choose. “Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert down there, and it’s kind of divesting,” DeVito said, referencing the musician’s decision to drop his April 10 concert in Greensboro, North Carolina. Springsteen said the cancellation was in support of the “fight against prejudice and bigotry. ” DeVito’s latest   feature is a short film, Curmudgeons, which sees DeVito professing his love for an angry old man (David Margulies) in a retirement home. Devito added: It’s the way it works in the world, it seems to be, because people are so invested in money —  and so invested in capitalism —  the only way to get people to wake up is to divest and say, “Look, we’re not going to do business with you if you’re going to treat people like   citizens and not give them their basic human rights. ” Over the past couple months, Danny DeVito has been an enthusiastic celebrity surrogate for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

"These Oscar-Nominated Documentaries Tell Intimate Stories Of Syria’s Civil War. The   Oscar category of best documentary short has a dramatic theme this year: Three of the five films nominated are about Syrians, and each offers an intimate,   account of the devastation in that country. One of the shorts, The White Helmets, follows a group of civilian volunteers in Aleppo who search for and rescue bombing victims. They’re the only first responders left and they’ve saved tens of thousands of people, digging them out from the rubble. (The sound of bombs blasting can be heard throughout the film.) ”They began with nothing,” says filmmaker Orlando von Einsiedel, who’s based in the U. K. ”They began, you know, clawing at the rubble with their bare hands. . .. They are the closest things Syrians have to superheroes.” The film’s stunning footage was shot by   Syrian photographer Khaled Khatib, who volunteers with the White Helmets. His camera follows them running into smoky crossfire just after the bombings. In one key scene, rescuers stop to carefully listen for the faint cries of a newborn baby. He’s been trapped under a   building for more than 16 hours. ”They pull him out and he’s completely unharmed,” von Einsiedel says. ”Apart from being dehydrated, he hasn’t got a single scratch on him. It’s the most extraordinary footage.” The men cheer and call him a miracle baby. Von Einsiedel says his documentary is ultimately a hopeful story in the midst of tragedy. ”One of the great things about documentary is its ability to create empathy. And, you know, there’s so much misunderstanding particularly at this moment about Muslims and people from places like Syria. We hope our film helps create bridges.” Since the film was shot, the White Helmets have stayed in Syria, where they continue to save lives but hundreds of thousands of other Syrians have had to flee the country. The nominated short 4. 1 Miles documents part of the treacherous journey some of them make. Named for the distance between Turkey and the Greek island of Lesbos, the film captures a day in the life of a Greek coast guard captain. Kyriakos Papadopoulos and his crew rescue groups of Syrian refugees clinging to flimsy dinghies in the Aegean Sea. Daphne Matziaraki made the film for her journalism master’s project at the University of California, Berkeley. She traveled to her native Greece to film Papadopoulos and his crew pulling women and children onto their   boat with ropes and their own hands. The captain is seen trying to revive unconscious children and get them to safety. ”This man is a true hero,” Matziaraki says. ”He, as a human being, feels this enormous responsibility to just respond and to save every life that he can. . .. It is his nightmare that he might have left somebody behind. Or when he loses somebody . .. and he cannot revive the child or he cannot get fast enough to his dock, that haunts him.” The third of these films, Watani: My Homeland, documents the lives of Hala Kamil and her four children, who, at the beginning of the film, live in an abandoned building in eastern Aleppo. Filmmaker Marcel Mettelsiefen shows Kamil’s husband, Free Syrian Army commander Abu Ali, shooting from atop a   building, followed by scenes of their young daughters crying or playing with toy guns, pretending to be what they call ”ISIS girls.” ”They were playful, incorporating their environment into their games,” Mettelsiefen says. ”I think it’s the secret of how children are able to adapt to anything.” Mattelsiefen was working as a photojournalist when he first met Abu Ali. He was shocked when the Muslim man invited him to film his wife and children. ”That’s unbelievabl[y] rare that a man allows me to speak to his wife and that she’s even able to be filmed and that I’m able to spend days with them.” In fact, Mattelsiefen spent three years with the family. In that time, Abu Ali was kidnapped by ISIS and Kamil and the children fled, eventually making their way to a small German city that welcomes refugees. Mattelsiefen follows them on their journey. ”We have seen enough fighting, shooting, dying,” he says, ”and I wanted to tell the story of how do these people survive.” Mattelsiefen plans to escort Hala Kamil to the Oscars ceremony on Sunday. Daphne Matziaraki, the director of 4. 1 Miles, is bringing Kyriakos Papadopoulos, and White Helmets filmmaker Orlando von Einsiedel is bringing his cinematographer, Khaled Khatib, as well as Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets. Update on Tuesday, Feb. 28: Raed Saleh and White Helmets cinematographer Khaled Khatib did not attend the Oscars ceremony on Sunday. After accepting the award for best documentary short, White Helmets filmmaker Orlando von Einsiedel told NPR, ”Raed Saleh . .. couldn’t come in the end because the last couple of days in Syria the violence has really escalated and he does   work and he decided in the end his time was better placed to do that. And Khaled Khatib, our cinematographer, we’re confused about this, too. The last two weeks have been very difficult. He had a U. S. visa, he tried to board a plane and he wasn’t able to come. We’re very sad about that.”",-0.5
" Killing Of Saudi Student Near Wisconsin University Not A Hate Crime, Police Say.  A suspect has been identified in the death of a Saudi exchange student near the University of   but the killing does not appear to be a hate crime, police officials said Friday. The University of   student died on Oct. 31 after being assaulted outside a pizza parlor near the campus.   Chancellor Bob Meyer identified the student as Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, 24, a junior majoring in business administration who came to the US in 2015 from Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. Menomonie Police, who are leading the investigation, said the assault occurred shortly after 2 a. m. on Sunday, Oct. 30, near Toppers Pizza on Main Street in Menomonie. On Friday, the Menomonie Police Department said in a statement authorities have identified a suspect their investigation, but were withholding their name while the Dunn County District Attorney’s office weighs whether to file charges. The suspect, police said, is not a University of   student nor a resident of Dunn County. After the assault, Alnahdi was taken to Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire to be treated for his injuries. Police told BuzzFeed News that the first officer saw blood coming from Alnahdi’s nose and that he was unconscious. Meyer later posted on Facebook that while in the hospital Alnahdi’s condition worsened and he died Monday. An autopsy was conducted to determine more detail about his injuries and the cause of death. Police said the investigation is still ongoing and urged any witnesses to step forward. Witnesses of the attack described the suspect as a    white male. “I want to make a personal appeal to anyone on campus or in the community who might have information that would help authorities locate the individual involved in the attack to come forward,” Meyer wrote on Facebook. Menomonie Police Commander of Operation Todd Swartz told BuzzFeed News that police were speaking with the local businesses to see if anyone captured surveillance video of the assault. “If any possible leads are identified in the video that would be released to the public,” Swartz said.

" This Fraternity And Its Brothers Are Facing More Than 850 Charges In A Teenager’s Hazing Death. ’ “Tim was an incredibly young man and an excellent student with very bright promising future ahead of him,” his father, Jim Piazza, said at a press conference Friday.’ ’ In a statement Friday, Beta Theta Pi  —   which was banned from returning to Penn State  —   said the nature of the charges against its members “are incredibly disheartening. ”’ ’ Here’s a summary of the events at the pledging ceremony that led to Piazza’s death, all according to the grand jury findings:’ ’ The grand jury concluded that despite noting the severity of Piazza’s condition through the night, the fraternity brothers and pledges did not call the authorities until 12 hours later.’ ’ Even after discovering Piazza’s unconscious body the next morning, none of the brothers called 911 immediately, the grand jury findings said.’ ’ Investigators recovered “a wealth of information” that showed “an active attempt to conceal   destroy evidence” after Piazza was transported to the hospital.’ ’ In a text messages to an unidentified person, the chapter’s president, Brendan Young, blamed himself for Piazza’s death, saying, “he looked fucking dead. ”’ ’ Here’s the evidence prosecutors released:’] The Centre County District Attorney announced more than 850 charges  —   including involuntary manslaughter  —   against the fraternity and its members for Piazza’s death during a pledging ceremony in February.  Piazza died from his injuries two days after after he was forced to consume “a   amount of alcohol” and fell down a flight of stairs during a hazing ritual for Beta Theta Pi pledges, according to grand jury findings released on Friday.  None of the brothers called for medical help for 12 hours after Piazza first fell  —   and attempted to cover up their role in his death by deleting their online exchanges, prosecutors said.  The Centre County DA released a document revealing chilling details and the sequence of events at the ceremony on Feb. 2 that led to Piazza’s death. Charges against the fraternity and its brothers include also include hazing and furnishing alcohol to minors. Piazza suffered from respiratory failure due to severe head trauma and compromised brain function, a medical expert testified. He had multiple traumatic brain injuries and a fracture at the base of his skull.  The operating surgeon who opened Piazza’s abdominal cavity discovered four liters  —   80% of a human body’s total blood supply  —   of dark, old blood in his abdomen, according to the grand jury findings. Jim Piazza, father of Tim Piazza speaks about charges. Jim Piazza said that the death of his son was the result of “a disobedience of law, a disregard of moral values which was then exacerbated by a egregious acts of  . ”  Penn State president Eric Barron described the details revealed in the grand jury findings as “  and incomprehensible,” in a statement on Friday.  “The alleged details in the grand jury presentment, which suggest the inhumane treatment of a student forced through hazing to consume dangerous amounts of alcohol and endure hours of suffering, are sickening and difficult to understand,” Barron said. Since Piazza’s death, the university had announced a number of “aggressive measures” to reform Greek life on campus, he said. The purpose of the gauntlet is to get pledges drunk in a very short time. Surveillance video from the fraternity house showed “a visibly intoxicated” Piazza severely staggering drunkenly toward the basement steps. A brother at the ceremony testified that he saw Piazza “lying on his stomach, face down at the bottom of the steps. ” In a group message to the brothers, one of them wrote: “Also Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs,   going to need help. ”  According to the findings, some of the brothers carried Piazza to a couch. The teen’s body was limp, he appeared to be unconscious, and had a bruise on his abdomen, according to surveillance video. As Piazza lay on the couch, the findings revealed that brothers allegedly dumped liquid on his face, slapped his face multiple times, struck him on his bruised abdomen, and attached a backpack to him to presumably prevent him from rolling over. Davis testified that he repeatedly told the brothers that they should call 911 and take Piazza to the hospital. He screamed at them for help but was ignored, and once was allegedly shoved against a wall. One of the brothers told him he was “crazy,” Davis testified. Davis also warned them that Piazza should not go to sleep because he could lapse into a coma, but one of the brothers told him that was a “myth. ”  At one point during the night, a brother allegedly tackled another brother who physically landed on top of an unconscious Piazza.  The documents revealed that as Piazza regained consciousness he fell several more times during the course of the night, striking his head twice on the hardwood floor, falling into an iron railing and landing on a stone floor, and falling head first into a door.  A brother told detectives that when he sent a GroupMe message warning that Piazza should be taken to a hospital, the only response from another brother was that he was being “overdramatic. ”  As Piazza lay on the floor during the night, some of the brothers allegedly stepped over his body and left him there, while one began Snapchatting him, according to the findings. No one immediately called 911 even though numerous brothers had cell phones, according to surveillance video of the scene. Footage showed that while Piazza lay unconscious on the floor, the brothers “shook him, attempted to prop his limp body up on the couch covered him with a blanket wiped his face and attempted to dress him. ”  One of the brother’s cell phone revealed internet searches for “falling asleep after head injury,” “true or false, a person with a serious head injury or concussion should be kept awake,” “cold extremities in drunk person,” and “binge drinking, alcohol, bruising or discoloration, cold feet and cold hands. ”  Around 42 minutes after discovering his body, one of the brothers called 911.  As they waited for police to arrive, a brother testified that someone suggested dressing Piazza “because they claimed Timothy might look better if he was dressed before medical treatment was rendered. ” However they were unsuccessful because of the stiffness of his arms. This included alleged directives to delete the GroupMe messages, get rid of evidence of alcohol in the basement to ensure the pledges “keep quiet” about the incidents of the night.  In an exchange between the chapter’s president, Brendan Young, and another brother, Young expressed his concerns about being sued for Piazza’s death saying, “They could get us for giving him alcohol that contributed to hisdeath. Also the guys taking care of him didn’t call an ambulance right away, so they could get in trouble for negligence. I just don’t know what I’m liable for as president. ”  A fraternity member told police that they were concerned about calling 911 after Piazza’s fall because they were “fearful the police would discover indications of of hazing as well as minors under the influence of alcohol in their house. ” “He is in shock and was on the verge of death,” the messages said.  In another exchange, Young said, “He fell down a flight of stairs because he was too drunk,” to which a person responded, “You can’t blame yourself. ”  Young replied: “How can I not? I don’t think you fully comprehend the situation. He looked fucking dead  …    ”  ",-1.0

But now that the conventions are upon us, recent history suggests that both candidates will, or at least should, narrow their travel. While Trump is unpredictable enough that his plans may be anyone's guess, we should expect the Clinton campaign to run a textbook race, focusing almost exclusively on the states likely to decide the election. In 2012, the members of both presidential tickets held post-convention visits in just 12 states, with a third of those visits coming in just a single state: Ohio, the historic maker of presidents that I explore in-depth in my new book, ""The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President."" Campaign ads were similarly concentrated. It wasn't always this way, though. Two days before he lost a very close presidential election to John F. Kennedy, then-Vice President Richard Nixon found himself in Anchorage, Alaska. A major part of his campaign had been a promise to visit all 50 states, and he saved Alaska for the end. In Anchorage, he noted the history he had made: ""This is indeed, a historic moment. It is one that will never be duplicated. This is the first time in the history of the United States that a candidate for the presidency of either party has visited all of the 50 states of this country."" Nixon's pledge became a target of easy criticism as he used valuable time at the end of the campaign. ""All through the campaign,"" wrote Theodore White in his definitive ""The Making of the President, 1960,"" ""as the race narrowed and it became obvious that it would be won or lost in the teetering industrial northeastern states, Nixon was cramped by his public pledge — so that on the last weekend of the campaign, as Kennedy barnstormed through populous Illinois, New Jersey, New York and New England, Nixon found himself committed to fly all the way north to Alaska, which offered only three electoral votes."" Even though it seems silly now, though, Nixon's vow made at least some sense in 1960. That year, in what would be an essentially 50-50 split in the national popular vote, 20 of the 50 states were decided by 5 percentage points or less, including big states like California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Texas. The same thing happened 16 years later in Jimmy Carter's 2-point national win over then-incumbent Gerald Ford. But by 2012, in Barack ObamaBarack Hussein Obama3 real problems Republicans need to address to win in 2020 Obama's high school basketball jersey sells for 0,000 at auction  Dirty little wars and the law: Did Osama bin Laden win? MORE's 4 point victory over GOP nominee Mitt Romney, just four states were decided by less than 5 points. As I note in ""The Bellwether,"" Ohio has the best record of picking presidential winners over the last 30 elections — only two times in that period has it voted for the loser (1944 and 1960). It also, on average, deviates only about 2 points from the national voting, also the best mark amongst the states. But a state like Ohio is arguably more important now than it was a half-century ago because the number of states like it — those that vote close the national average — are dwindling, as the examples from 1960, 1976 and 2012 make clear. In fact, Nixon actually won Ohio in 1960, one of the rare times it voted for the loser. Let's look at this another way, though. In 1960, about 75 percent of the nation's electoral votes were in states that voted less than five points from the national average, one way or the other. So in that election, where the national popular two-party vote was basically tied at 50-50, any state that voted 54-46 one way or the other, or closer, would be included. As the country has become more sorted, partisan and polarized over time, with fewer crossover voters and more ideologically cohesive parties, that number dwindled, so that in 2012, just about 30 percent of the nation's electoral votes were in states that voted within less than 5 points, either way, of the national average. Included in that group are the competitive states that Americans have become accustomed to in recent years, like Colorado and Virginia — which are new to the group of highly competitive presidential states — as well as states that have longer histories reflecting the nation, like Nevada and Ohio, which nearly always vote for the presidential winner, as well as Florida, the biggest state in the Union that has been perennially competitive over the past handful of elections. Teddy White rolled his eyes at Nixon's 50-state ploy in 1960. Nowadays, even a 25-state strategy would elicited the same reaction.

A trio of liberal groups sued over the order earlier this month, arguing it exceeds his authority under the Constitution and blocks vital health, safety and environmental protections. The February lawsuit from the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Communications Workers of America and Public Citizen now seeks to halt the implementation of Trump’s order.

"The healing power of kindness                                                        .  (CNN) Science tells us we are more likely to perform a thoughtful deed when someone does one for us. Take for instance the stranger who smiles at you in the elevator. Almost always, you’ll return the gesture    and you’ll be more prone to smile at the next person you see. It’s a ripple effect.  February   marks Random Acts of Kindness Week, an annual occasion to unite humanity through altruism. In honor of the   celebration, CNN reached out to three people who make the world a finer place one generous act at a time.  Pay it forward, Abby Jones’ call to kindness started in first grade, when a classmate approached her while she sat alone crying in a corner.  ”She talked to me and made me feel better because I was bullied a lot.  I always carried that with me.” The gesture prompted the    Denver, Colorado, girl to start ”Abby’s Pay It Forward Project.” Once a year, she provides time and resources to groups around the world. Since the project began, she already raised $1, 000 for tsunami victims, donated towels to an animal shelter and made breakfast for the police. Abby says she takes pride in caring for others because it’s what the world needs    and she doesn’t mind that it gives her a nice ”tingly feeling.” ”Kindness should be so natural for us” Fifteen years ago, a group of students in Duvall, Washington, asked health teacher Peggy McKey Filer if she would advise a new high school club called Random Acts of Kindness. The club has two rules: Never put yourself in danger and never expect anything in return. When students sign up, they agree to participate in good deeds throughout the community. Some mow lawns for neighbors and wash their parents’ cars others simply hand out compliments to their peers.  Since the club started, it’s grown from five members to more than 100. The future of the club, says Peggy, is in the hands of the students. ”The kids are driving the bus. I can’t imagine the school without the club,” she said and added: ”It’s not just poor people who need kindness. If I bought Bill Gates a cup of tea, I bet he’d think that was cool.” Father and son strike a chord with the poor, Paul Avila’s son, Pauly, was born with medical conditions that impaired his ability to see and talk. As a child, only music calmed him when he cried. ”Whenever we played a musical CD he just lit up with a big smile and would sit there for hours listening.”  It was an ”aha!” moment that led him to create Pauly’s Project, which distributes thousands of radios to the homeless in Los Angeles’ Skid Row. ”It’s a way to connect the homeless to society,” said Paul. ”Music makes a huge difference.” Now when he drives through Skid Row, he can hear people playing music and see them dancing. It brings him joy to know he plays a part in that. Kindness is contagious, The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation kicks off with the launch of #RAKWeek2017, an online generator to serve as a rally point for events this year. Companies, organizations, communities and schools are encouraged to participate.  ”We are giving people permission to do the things they always wanted to do in the first place,” says Gary Dixon, the foundation’s president. ”Permission is a very powerful thing.” Random Acts of Kindness Week is observed worldwide.",-1.0
"Geologists find very hot lava flowed on Earth in recent times. A new study shows that some komatiites — cooled lava that flowed on Earth as long as 2.5 billion years ago — may be much younger and hotter than geologists previously thought. The discovery: Geologists recently found evidence of 89 million-year-old komatiites in Costa Rica. ""These are very, very young,"" said Esteban Gazel, author of the study, told Popular Science. ""In geologic terms, 89 million years ago is like it happened a second ago."" Why it's so startling: Most komatiites originated during the Archean age, between 4 billion and 2.5 billion years ago, when Earth's interior was so hot that some lava flows were white instead of red. Since then, Earth's mantle has cooled by about 500 degrees Fahrenheit, but the discovery of these newer komatiites suggest deeper areas of the planet have maintained the hot temperatures of the Archean period. Why it matters: ""What is really fascinating about this study is that we show that the planet is still capable of producing lavas as hot as during the Archean time period,"" Gazel said in a statement. ""Based on our results... we think that mantle plumes are 'tapping' a deep, hot region of the mantle that hasn't cooled very much since the Archean. We think that this region is probably being sustained by heat from the crystallizing core of the planet.""",0.0
"Senior law enforcement officials urge Trump to scrap ’ineffective’ crime plan. Dozens of senior law enforcement officials have urged Donald Trump to abandon his draconian crackdown on crime and to instead revive efforts to reform the criminal justice system. In a report   by David Brown, the former Dallas police chief widely praised for his response to the killing of five officers last year, the officials said Trump should rethink his blunt    plans. “Decades of experience have convinced us of a sobering reality: today’s crime policies, which too often rely only on jail and prison, are simply ineffective in preserving public safety,” they said. The report was published on Friday by Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, a coalition of more than 200 current and former senior police officers and prosecutors.  They criticized an executive order on crime fighting signed by Trump on Thursday, saying that the president had encouraged police officers to focus on general lawbreaking rather than to target violent crime. Too much of the justice department’s $5. 5bn yearly funding for local policing is already spent on “antiquated law enforcement tools, such as dragnet enforcement of   offenses” the officials wrote. Warning that Trump’s order threatens to “repeat this mistake” the officials said the president should understand “we cannot fund all crime fighting tactics” and that police and prosecutors should focus their time and money on fighting a recent uptick in violent crime. At the same time, Brown and his   former New Orleans police chief Ronal Serpas, said that Trump should help bolster “community policing” a philosophy that focuses on strengthening relations between officers and residents rather than promoting confrontation. They expressed alarm about reports that the Trump administration intends to close the justice department’s community oriented policing services (Cops) office, which works on improving relations between police and residents and has recently reviewed embattled departments in places such as San Francisco and St Louis. “We urge the president, instead, to request more funding in his next budget to Congress for the Cops Office to continue strengthening and expanding local community policing,” said the report. The officials also asked Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to get behind attempts to reduce the US prison population. They noted that Sessions, in his previous job as a conservative senator for Alabama, played a significant role in blocking the passage of bipartisan sentencing reform legislation proposed in 2015. The report suggested that Sessions might view the proposals differently as attorney general given that more than 25% of his justice department’s budget will be spent on funding federal prisons. “The more dollars these prisons require, the less available to allocate to federal law enforcement in our fight to secure public safety,” the report said. More resources should also be devoted to treatment of mental illness and drug addiction, according to the officials, who said the excessive imprisonment of those with such problems leads to the release of people who are “practically destined to commit more crimes and cycle into prison”.

"Virginia city to pay $1m to avert lawsuit in William Chapman police shooting. The city of Portsmouth, Virginia, has agreed to pay the family of William Chapman $1m to avert a civil lawsuit over the unarmed black   ’s fatal shooting by a police officer. Two sources closely familiar with the negotiations, who were not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed the settlement had been agreed by both sides in principle but had not yet been formally signed. Officer Stephen Rankin shot Chapman dead in the parking lot of a Walmart superstore in the city in April last year during a confrontation over an alleged shoplifting. It was Rankin’s second deadly shooting of an unarmed man. Rankin, 36, was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for the shooting last month. He had been charged with murder. A jury recommended a sentence of 2. 5 years in prison. Judge Johnny Morrison will formally sentence Rankin on 12 October. Rankin’s attorneys have said he will appeal against his conviction. Chapman’s mother, Sallie, and her attorney Jon Babineau declined to comment on the agreement. Babineau had been readying a lawsuit against Rankin, the city of Portsmouth and Ed Hargis, the city’s police chief at the time of the shooting. The lawsuit, on behalf of Chapman’s family, was expected to argue Hargis and city authorities should never have allowed Rankin to work as a police officer. Rankin was terminated from his job after being indicted for murder over the Chapman shooting. In an article that first confirmed Rankin as the officer who killed Chapman, the Guardian disclosed in June last year that alarms were raised within the Portsmouth police department about Rankin’s conduct even before his first deadly shooting of an unarmed man. The Guardian published a series of articles about Chapman’s fatal shooting to coincide with the launch of the Counted, an investigation to document every death caused by police in the US. Earl Lewis, a cousin of Chapman who has acted as a family spokesman since the shooting, credited the articles with setting in motion the prosecution of Rankin. “It instantly changed things,” Lewis said following Rankin’s conviction. “Nobody was listening to what we had to say but your article gave Sallie a voice. If it wasn’t for the Guardian, we wouldn’t be here. ” A grand jury previously declined to bring charges against Rankin for fatally shooting Kirill Denyakin, a hotel cook from Kazakhstan, in April 2011. Rankin shot Denyakin 11 times outside an apartment building in Portsmouth after a 911 caller reported that the    was banging loudly on the front door. The officer alleged Denyakin charged at him and reached for his waistband.",-0.5

"America is the ‘last man standing’ with positive yields, strategist says. The disconnect between global markets and bond yields is something Mark Grant, chief fixed income strategist at Hilltop Securities, says he hasn't seen in four decades. The dip in global bond yields, though, is herding global investors to the U.S. ""People are going anywhere they can to try and get a return on their capital,"" Grant told CNBC's ""Squawk Box "" on Tuesday. ""That money's going to come to the United States, where it's certainly much safer where we're not in as bad a financial condition."" Money moves in and out of Asia, and Europe, depending on the best opportunity, he said. The U.S. is now getting a ""spillover"" effect"" as other major central banks kick up quantitative easing and go to negative interest rates. ""Clearly the best opportunity now for yield is in the U.S.,"" Grant said. ""You're seeing huge amounts of money coming into the United States and I think that's what's driving these markets."" The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high Monday, and the Dow hit a high for the year. Meanwhile, U.S. bonds hit record lows last week, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury note closed below 1.4 percent for the first time in history. ""The disconnect, is quite frankly, unreal,"" he said. Grant said there's no fundamental or technical analysis, the only rational reason is the world's central banks. ""America is the last man standing with positive yields and it will not be until Treasury yields approach European and Japanese sovereign yields that this migration of money into American securities will end,"" he said. ""Normalcy is just not present and won't be for years, in my opinion."" He pointed to fear in European markets like Italy, with low economic growth and struggling banks. The euro zone, as a result of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, is also in ""significant"" trouble, Grant said. While the euro won't disappear, he said any further breakup of the EU calls its question into value. ""The U.S. is looking like a safe place for both equity and debt and of course our yields in the United States for Treasurys and corporates are significantly higher than what you can find in Asia and Europe,"" Grant said. It's not just fixed income. The ""barges have sailed off from Asia and Europe"" as they go to negative rates, bringing massive amounts of money to the U.S. both in equities, debt, risk-on and risk-off assets. U.S. stocks have become increasingly appealing, especially those that kick off higher dividend yields than yields in Treasurys. ""They're safer than I'd though,"" Grant said.",0.0

"Wendy Sherman leaving state department. Washington (CNN) A top State Department official    Wendy Sherman    will depart following the completion of the Iran nuclear talks, a source confirms to CNN. Sherman has been the lead U. S. negotiator with Iran as the Obama administration has pursued a nuclear agreement. ”Wendy has been an absolutely critical member of my team, most notably in her work spearheading the nuclear negotiations with Iran, but on nearly every important issue that has crossed my desk,” said Secretary of State John Kerry in a statement provided to CNN.  RELATED: Senate overwhelmingly passes Iran nuclear bill, Sherman, the under secretary for political affairs, is the   State Department official. A key member of Kerry’s team, she departed for Vienna, Austria, Wednesday along with the negotiating team to continue the European   P5+1 talks, according to a State Department release.  On Saturday, Sherman is scheduled to join Kerry in Geneva, Switzerland, for further meetings with Iranian officials. ”Wendy’s tenacity and skill, and her close relations and collaboration with her P5+1 and EU counterparts, were instrumental in enabling us to reach the interim agreement that halted the progress of Iran’s nuclear program for the first time in almost a decade and made our nation, our partners and allies and our world, safer,” Kerry said.  Sherman, a former social worker, also served as the director for EMILY’s List, a political fundraising group aimed at getting   Democratic women elected.

" Family Survives Two Nights Lost In The Woods On Halloween Candy And Rain Water.  A Washington family found safe on Thursday said they survived two nights lost in the woods by eating the Halloween candy their toddler found in their stranded van. Jason and Melissa McAlister and their two younger children, who are 8 months old and 2 years old, were reported missing after the couple failed to pick up their two older children, who are 5 and 7 years old, after school Tuesday. “Everybody is good. God’s great. We’re happy to be alive,” Jason McAlister, 33, said at a news conference Thursday. The family got stuck in the woods while they were sightseeing in Mason County, a rugged area southwest of Seattle, and the road gave way as they tried to drive around a fallen tree. “This one was a trooper,” he said of his    daughter. “She was rooting around in the van, finding all kinds of Halloween candy. ” The family attempted to walk out of the woods the first day around 1 p. m. but ended up having to sleep in a   shelter he built along the side of the road to stay out of the wind as temperatures dropped into the 30s. “It actually kept us warm, considering I didn’t have a fire going,” he said. The following day, they returned to the van and attempted to dry their clothes with the heater. They listened to the radio and were encouraged to learn search parties were looking for them. The family slept inside the van that night for warmth. The next day they began walking out again, tearing large pieces of paper and leaving them on the ground in hopes that rescue teams flying over head would spot them. Later that day, they were finally discovered by hunters who knew about the missing family because of the media attention and helped drive them to meet medics. Steve Shumate, chief criminal sheriff’s deputy in Grays Harbor County, told the Associated Press it was an immense relief to find the family. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Grays Harbor County Sheriff’s Office for more information. “They did an excellent job keeping their cool and staying dry and warm,” Schumate told AP, adding that he hoped they had learned their lesson and planned to get a cell phone. For his part, McAlister told reporters he probably won’t get a cell phone since there’s no reception where he lives. Next time, though, he would drive the truck when taking his family on an adventure.  ",-1.0
"Nunes ethics investigation triggered by internal concerns. Shortly after Devin Nunes stepped aside from the Intel Committee's Russia probe, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would be investigating allegations that he ""may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information."" What this means: The Ethics Committee's internal concerns were serious enough that the truly bipartisan committee — it sits an equal number of Republicans and Democrats — determined that an investigation was warranted. What the concerns might be: The Daily Beast's Nunes whisperer Tim Mak has a roundup: James Comey said during a House Intel hearing last month, ""All FISA applications reviewed by the court and collection by us pursuant to our FISA authority is classified."" So all of the ""incidental collection"" involving the Trump team that Nunes made the centerpiece of his impromptu March 22 press conference at the White House is still classified, even if it has been publicly reported. And don't forget: None of this squares with Nunes' own statement announcing his recusal, which blamed the decision on ""several leftwing activist groups"" that he alleged ""filed accusations against [him] with the Office of Congressional Ethics.""",0.0
"Tristan O’Tierney, who helped develop Square’s original payment app, has passed away – TechCrunch. Tristan O’Tierney, a co-founder of the payments company Square, has passed away at age 35. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, O’Tierney died last weekend in Florida of addiction-related causes after a hospital was unable to revive him. In the Chron’s piece, it reports that Square co-founders Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey hired O’Tierney to develop Square’s original mobile payment app in early 2009, and that O’Tierney is generally credited as a co-founder. He left the company in 2013, eight years after coming to the Bay Area, where he also worked as a software engineer at Yahoo for nearly two years and worked briefly at Apple, VMware and Tapulous. In recent years, O’Tierney had been working as a freelance photographer in Los Angeles, according to his LinkedIn profile. (You can check out some of his work here.) He was also the director of Mobile at a short-lived San Francisco-based company, Voteraide, that aimed to empower voters by enabling them to interact with candidates and elected officials as verified voters. O’Tierney was reportedly in Florida as part of a months-long rehabilitation program. Dom Sagolla, a former colleague and roommate of O’Tierney, tells the Chron it was he who introduced O’Tierney to Dorsey 11 years ago. He says O’Tierney had helped to develop the official iPhone app for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and that O’Tierney and Dorsey met at an iPhone-app development event that he organized. “I will really miss him and want his memory and legacy to last,” said Sagolla. O’Tierney clearly had varied interests. Though he studied computer science at the Rochester Institute of Technology, he also later obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from the San Francisco Art Institute.

"Egypt: Christian Couple Stabbed to Death on Coptic Christmas Day. At least three members of the Coptic Christian minority have been killed so far this year in Egypt, including a couple found in their bed with their throats slit on January 6, the traditional Coptic Christmas Day, reports Christian Today, citing World Watch Monitor (WWM). [The couple has been identified by WWM, an organization that covers Christian persecution across the globe, as Gamal Sami, 60, and his wife, Nadia, 48.  While police have cited robbery as the motivation for the deaths, the woman’s brother and the first person to reach the crime scene, Magdy Amin Girgis, has suggested they were murdered because of their faith, noting that nothing had been taken from the couple’s home. Girgis told the Christian organization that he found the couple with their throats cut and “drenched in blood,” still on their bed. WWM notes: The murders followed another deadly attack on a Coptic Christian only three days earlier. Youssef Lamei was murdered in Alexandria on 3 January by an alleged “professional” killer. The attack on the couple bore similarities with Lamei’s murder, according to reports. The main suspects for the double killing are two men known only as Mohammad M and Abd   Q, according to the police. It is understood that the two men did not know their victims. The couple is reportedly from the mainly Christian village of Tukh   near Tala, home to three churches that canceled their Christmas services to mourn the dead. In a recent   the Chronicle Herald from Canada argues that Egypt’s Coptic Christians, who make up an estimated ten percent of the country’s population of nearly 95 million, are facing an increase in violent attacks. A terrorist attack against a Coptic church in the Egyptian capital of Cairo killed at least 25 Christians in December. The Islamic State ( ) took responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, the administration of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   accused the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated a terrorist group in Egypt and other   countries. Egypt’s Coptic Pope Tawadros II told Egyptian lawmakers in 2016 that there has been at least one attack against Christians per month during the past three years. The Chronicle Herald opinion article points out that law enforcement seldom investigates the crimes. According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, about 77 incidents of sectarian violence between 2011 and 2016 in Minya province south of Cairo, home to Egypt’s largest Christian community, have occurred. Egyptian Coptic Pope Tawadros has accused media outlets of reporting false news about the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Egypt. “Egypt is not the best society in the world, but both its people and its leadership are trying to become the best society,” declared the pope. Nevertheless, the Chronicle Herald opines, “Increasingly, Egyptian Christians are speaking out against the government, ignoring the wishes of the church.",1.0
"Mosul: 112 civilian bodies pulled from site of coalition airstrike. Mosul, Iraq (CNN) At least 112 bodies have been pulled from the site of a   coalition airstrike in Mosul, senior Iraqi health official Ahmed Dubardani said Monday. The deaths have sparked renewed concerns about civilian casualties from coalition airstrikes targeting ISIS fighters in the city.  A senior Iraqi military officer said a March 17 coalition airstrike on an   ISIS truck led to the deaths of dozens of civilians. The coalition said a review confirmed one strike that day in the area where the casualties were reported. But US officials have not confirmed the senior Iraqi officer’s account.  Both the Iraqi and US defense departments launched investigations Saturday into possible civilian deaths in airstrikes between March 17 and 23. While those investigations continue, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said, ”There is no military force in the world that is proven more sensitive to civilian casualties.” ”We are keenly aware that every battlefield where an enemy hides behind women and children is also a humanitarian field, and we go out of our way to always do everything humanly possible to reduce the loss of life or injury among innocent people,” Mattis said. ”The same cannot be said for our adversaries.”  ’Told to stay at home’ US and Iraqi forces have been trying to regain control of Mosul    Iraq’s   city    from ISIS since October.  ISIS had a firm grip on Mosul since 2014, but suffered a major blow when Iraqi security forces regained control of eastern Mosul in January. But the arduous fight for western Mosul continues.  According to Amnesty International, many of those killed in the airstrikes were ”following Iraqi government advice not to leave during the offensive.”  ”The high civilian toll suggests that coalition forces leading the offensive in Mosul have failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” said Amnesty’s Donatella Rovera, who carried out field investigations in Mosul, in a statement.  ”The fact that Iraqi authorities repeatedly advised civilians to remain at home instead of fleeing the area, indicates that coalition forces should have known that these strikes were likely to result in a significant numbers of civilian casualties.” Amnesty also accused ISIS forces of ”shamefully resort( ing) to using civilians as human shields.”  Life under ISIS rule, For Iraqis in recently freed parts of Mosul, the haunting memories of ISIS are still fresh. One woman in the southern Wadi Hajer neighborhood said ISIS fighters forced her and her family from their home and took them to another house to be used as human shields. She said life under ISIS was humiliating and painful. A grandmother in the same neighborhood said she lived with her son, his wife and their children as ISIS tormented the area.  She recalled a time when her family’s water got cut off, and the whole family had to share one last remaining glass. ”I would go around and give my grandson a sip, and then the others,” the grandmother said. ”We would all take one sip at a time.”",-1.0
"Holoride’s in-car VR solution is the best thing at CES 2019 – TechCrunch. After days of demos and announcements and miles of walking, I’m confident in declaring Holoride the best thing at this year’s CES. The designation of “The best thing at CES 2019” is my badging. This isn’t an official award handed out by a governing body. This is just me saying Holoride is the best thing I’ve seen at the show. This year’s CES is fine, I guess. The main theme is connecting services around the smart home. There’s a huge range of devices that now support services from Amazon, Google and Apple. CES 2019 also featured the launch of new silicon chipsets and self-driving platforms. But the thing that impressed me the most is from Holoride, a startup from Audi that wants to put VR in cars to entertain and reduce motion sickness. Iron Man needs help, Rocket told me. And like that I was thrust into a space battle against Thanos’ bad guys. There was an Oculus on my head and my body was dipping and diving, shooting through space, while I was waving my hands around, blasting the enemy. It was straight out of Disney World (partly because Disney helped with the content). Except I was in Vegas, in the back of an Audi SUV hitting speeds of 90 mph on a track. After two laps around the track, I walked away fine. I didn’t feel sick at all, even though I’m the sort of person who can’t look at their phone in a car. Matching the VR content to the vehicle’s movements is key to the Holoride experience. In short, when the car moves, the content moves in the same way. This reduces motion sickness, and, from my demo, I can confirm it works — at least on me. The technology comes from a small startup recently spun out of Audi in a play to put VR in every car. The founders have been working on the technology behind the in-car VR system for several years. The automaker holds a minority interest through subsidiary Audi Electronics Venture, which helped develop the technology. Audi will license the technology to Holoride and the startup will use an open platform to allow any automaker as well as content developers to create whatever reality formats they desire. I’ve experienced countless VR experiences, and this was one of the best demos I’ve had. The use case is compelling too. Not only does it provide entertainment, but it also solves motion sickness. It’s easy to imagine this in an ad-supported format in the back of an Uber or while on a long-distance bus. It could work in planes too. It could improve long car rides with the kids. Holoride is a longshot and there are countless questions around the content, consumer outreach and compatibility. In order for it to take off, the company needs to build an ecosystem complete with developers, auto makers and consumers. Building amazing experiences is one thing; selling amazing experiences is even harder. I used VR in a car going 90 mph and didn’t get sick Audi spins out Holoride to put VR in every car",0.0
"They Came To America And Found Love. But First, They Found ’Love’ In A Dictionary. When Tariq Sheikh first saw Tabinda, he remembers she was wearing yellow gloves. A recent arrival from the Dominican Republic, Tabinda had just taken a job as a housekeeper at a New York City hotel  —   the very same hotel where Tariq worked at the hotel’s front desk. And when Tariq saw her, he was utterly  . He couldn’t even say hello. ”Oh, I thought you was rude and mean,” she tells him, on a visit with StoryCorps in 2014. ”I said, ’Oh my God, this guy don’t even say hi.’ You’re just staring at me!” But there was a very simple reason for his silence at the time, he tells her: She was the woman of his dreams. ”Yeah,” she answers, ”but I didn’t have that dream!” Still, Tariq, who was an immigrant himself, from Pakistan, built up his courage to ask her out for coffee. And it took her two days to answer  —   but she had a good reason, too: ”because I didn’t know how to speak English,” she explains. Eventually, with the help of a pocket    dictionary, she scrawled her answer on a napkin: ”OK, yes.” ”Language is not a barrier for the love,” says Tabinda, who  —   spoiler alert!  —   is now Tabinda Sheikh. They were married in 1991. But at the time, when he was courting her back in 1989, language still posed a few complications. One day Tariq, who by that point had begun driving a yellow cab in New York City, asked if he could drive her home. When he asked her address, she told him simply: New Jersey. Just New Jersey. ”I say, ’Oh my God, today I gonna have a long night!’ ” he laughs. Neither of them had family with them in the U. S. So, as her relationship with Tariq bloomed, she had to call back home to tell her family about him. ”I am in love,” she told them. ”I have a gordito! They say, ’Gordito? Chubby man? You don’t like fat men!’ ” Of course, he begs to differ: ”I was not that fat,” he laughs. ”Just chubby, yes.” At that time, Tariq had been working long hours  —   ”like 72 hours, continuously,” he says  —   and so, when they both stopped for a break on a park bench, he lay his head down on her lap. And there he slept. ”I don’t even want to move. If I move, he’s going to wake up,” she says. ”It was beautiful looking the moon, the stars.” In the morning when he awoke, he was shocked to find her still sitting there with him. ”That was the moment I fell in love with you,” he tells her, looking back from their vantage point in 2014. ”Love is a wonderful thing,” she says. ”This is my man! And we’re gonna be married 23 years now.” ”She’s telling me 23 years,” he answers. ”For me, it’s like yesterday.” Audio produced for Morning Edition by Liyna Anwar and Jasmyn Belcher Morris.

"Uber and Yandex merge ride-hailing business in Russia. Uber is teaming up with Russian search company Yandex to form a standalone ride-hailing company, the companies announced on Thursday. It will operate in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, and Georgia, covering 127 cities. Uber made a similar move last August when it merged its Chinese business with Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing company. The decision was effectively a capitulation in the face of Didi's much biggest market share, raising the question of how well Uber has been doing in Russia and surrounding areas. In June, the companies reported a combined total of 35 million rides and $130 million in gross bookings. Uber will invest $225 million and Yandex will put in $100 million into the new company, which will have a post-money valuation of  $3.725 billion. Yandex will own 59.3%, Uber will have 36.6%, and employees will own 4.1% on a fully diluted basis. Tigran Khudaverdyan, currently the chief executive of YandexTaxi, will become CEO, while the new board will have four Yandex-appointed reps and three Uber-appointed reps. The local operations of Uber's food delivery business, UberEats, also will become part of the new company.",0.0
"Google’s huge 4K touchscreen whiteboard is now on sale for $5K – TechCrunch. Google’s Jamboard is not a kitchen app for curating PB&J recipes – it’s a 55-inch digital whiteboard, with pen and touch input, companion iOS and Android apps, an Nvidia Jetson TX1 processor on board and 4K resolution. The behemoth is an enterprise-focused collaboration tool, that comes in three fun colors and has a stand that looks ripped from a Herman Miller catalog, and if you’re in the U.S. you can order one today for $4,999. This seems like a weird place for Google to go, but the company is one of the leading enterprise software vendors when you consider how far and wide its G-Suite products reach. Jamboard also underwent testing with companies including Google clients Dow Jones, Whirlpool and Pinterest, so it’s obvious this is more than a weird side project that became something Google launched just because it sometimes does random shit. No, it’s more like Google Jamboard is the Google Home of the office – a way to embed itself in the business world at a core level, where it’s more likely to become an integral, and nearly invisible part of doing work. Plus, it’s a services revenue business; Jamboard support and management runs $600 per year ($300 per year for early customers) and access to Drive files on Jamboard requires a G Suite plan. Google’s identity as a hardware company gets more interesting all the time, and Jamboard is an eccentric, but smart extension of its overall strategy, which marries service and gear more closely than most in the enterprise space.",0.0
"Trump’s Army Secretary nominee withdrawing: reports | TheHill. Vincent Viola, President Trump’s choice to be Secretary of the Army, is withdrawing himself from consideration for the post, according to multiple reports.  Viola, who is reportedly worth $1.8 billion, is the founder of electronic trading firm Virtu Financial and was previously the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange from 2001 to 2004. He also owns the NHL’s Florida Panthers. Viola told Trump on Friday that he would be unable to accept the nomination because separating himself from his businesses has proven insurmountable, Bloomberg News reported. The extent of Viola’s business holdings would have been detailed in ethics and financial disclosure forms filed during the nomination process, it added.  He planned to transfer ownership of his business venutres to family members and put the hockey team's vice chairman in charge of operations, but the Military Times reported that arrangement did not meet Pentagon requirements. Earlier this month The New York Times reported that Viola was once accused of punching a concessions worker at a racetrack. Updated 11:12 p.m.  View the discussion thread.

"FBI: Major Cities Hit by 21.6 Percent Spike in Murders - Breitbart. Violent crime, including murder, continued its rise across the country during the first half of 2016, and the largest cities seeing a 21. 6 percent increase in murders, says a new FBI report. [Comparing the first six months of 2015 to the first six months of 2016, the FBI found murders rose 5. 2 percent, aggravated assaults rose 6. 5 percent, robbery rose 3. 2 percent, and rapes under both the “legacy” and “revised” definitions increased 4. 4 percent and 3. 5 percent, respectively.  The report was issued days after President Barack Obama publicly denied the rising tide of crime. “There is no growing crime wave,” Obama insisted in an essay for the Harvard law Review, published Jan. 5. Regardless of Obama’s statements, crime rates rose nationwide, the FBI report shows: Violent crime increased in all city groupings. Among cities, violent crime rose the most over the previous year (9. 7 percent) in those with populations of 1, 000, 000 and over. In cities with populations from 500, 000 to 999, 999, violent crime increased 5. 2 percent, and in cities with 250, 000 to 499, 999 inhabitants, violent crime was up 4. 3 percent. Violent crime increased 6. 3 percent in metropolitan counties and rose 1. 6 percent in nonmetropolitan counties. Violent crime increased in all four regions of the nation. These crimes were up 6. 4 percent in the West, 5. 9 percent in both the Midwest and in the South, and 1. 2 percent in the Northeast, U. S. cities with populations of one million or more people include New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, and Dallas. The largest cities saw shocking increases in violent crime compared to the first half of 2015: Overall, violent crime increased 9. 7 percent. Murders spiked 21. 6 percent. Rapes under the revised definition —  defined as “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim” —  rose 11. 3 percent. Robbery increased 6. 3 percent. Aggravated assault rose 11. 4 percent. Burglary declined by 5. 4 percent, while motor vehicle thefts rose 5. 9 percent and larceny rose 3. 3 percent. Arson rose 5. 3 percent. While property crimes declined overall at 0. 6 percent, they rose in the largest U. S. cities by 2. 1 percent. As Breitbart News previously reported, the FBI’s 2015 crime report revealed a 10. 8 percent increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 —  the largest increase in a single year since 1971 —  and a 3. 9 percent increase in violent crime overall. Chicago’s gun crime death toll is so high it’s distorting national murder figures. TheWall Street Journal reports  “37 of the 65 largest police agencies” counted homicide increases in 2016. Obama claimed in his Harvard essay that “there is no growing crime wave. ” That claim ignores the dramatic murder wave that took place under his watch, and allows him to ignore the bodies of at least 1, 500 additional dead Americans to declare that crime remains “near historic lows. ” Under Obama, the nation is seeing the sudden reversal of a   decline in violent crime. The reversal began in 2014, after the Ferguson race riot and as he launched his “  ” campaign against state and local police. The FBI was quick to see the reversal. In October 2015, FBI Director James Comey said “part of the explanation” for rising crime “is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement over the last year,” implicitly criticizing Obama’s strategy of using   activist groups and his Justice Department’s law enforcement regulations to reshape local policing. The reversal also comes as Obama releases more criminals from prison. Obama has also boasted of that he will be the “first president in decades to leave office with a federal prison population lower than when I took office. ” That’s true, according to a vocal critic of Obama’s    attitude towards incarceration rates: Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton says the administration used revised sentencing guidelines to release 30, 000 felons from federal prison, bringing the total number of federal prisoners to fewer than 200, 000. And Obama has continued to commute the sentences of drug traffickers as drugs kill more Americans.  In 2014, more than 47, 000 people died from   deaths. Thanks to Obama’s commutations, former armed drug traffickers will be back in American communities as early as March.",1.0
"A Wild-Polio Outbreak in Nigeria.         For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, August 11, 2016, was supposed to be a historic day for the global effort to eradicate the polio virus. This Thursday would have marked two years since someone on the African continent last contracted the   virus. If the continent made it without a case for a third year, the World Health Organization could have certified it as   and Africa would have joined four other WHO regions —  the Americas, Europe, the Western Pacific, and   Asia —  in eradicating wild polio. But it is not to be. Nigerian health officials announced on Thursday, the same day they expected to celebrate the anniversary, that two children have been paralyzed by wild polio in the country’s northeastern Borno State. “It has set us back,” said Isaac Adewole, the Nigerian health minister, according to the Nigerian newspaper Leadership. Borno State will now undergo three rounds of emergency immunizations, he added. Neighboring countries have also been put on alert to look for cases of wild polio. Matshidiso Moeti, the regional director of WHO in Africa, said she was “deeply saddened” by the news. “The [Nigerian] government has made significant strides to stop this paralyzing disease in recent years. The overriding priority now is to rapidly immunize all children around the affected area and ensure that no other children succumb to this terrible disease. ” “What that means is that the certification will start all over again,” said Haruna Mshelia, the minister of health for Borno State, according to Leadership. “It wasn’t that we were not doing the job. A chunk of the state was out of reach, and we couldn’t reach children there. ” Parts of Borno State are controlled by the terrorist group Boko Haram. One of the   campaign’s techniques was to rush in with workers and vaccines as soon as a village was liberated from the group. Other than Nigeria, only Afghanistan and Pakistan still experience outbreaks of wild polio virus. The two countries have had 19 cases of wild polio so far this year. Wild polio is not to be confused with   polio, a weaker form of the virus that sometimes emerges when a country’s health system is under considerable stress. Last year, two children in Ukraine contracted this less virulent form of the disease. Nigeria must now wait at least until the summer of 2019 to receive a   certification. Yet even with Thursday’s setback, the country has made remarkable progress overall: As recently as four years ago, half of all wild polio cases worldwide originated in Nigeria.",-0.5
"Hysteria As Farage Raises Spectre of Cologne Rape Scandal. Britain’s mainstream media went into overdrive this weekend to accuse UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage of “scaremongering” and “outrageous claims” after he raised the spectre of the Cologne mass migrant rape scandal as well as major cultural clashes between migrants and the West. [Speaking to LBC radio, Breitbart London’s Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam dispelled the notion that Mr. Farage was being provocative, instead citing the statistics recently released by the German government which showed that migrants were overrepresented in crime statistics, including those related to sexual offences.  But the Independent, the BBC, the Guardian, the Telegraph, the Mirror, and the Huffington Post all took issue with Mr. Farage’s comments without citing the statistics recently released by the German government. Nor did they seek to include evidence from around Europe  —   Sweden especially  —   about how migrants were not integrating, and indeed even attack other migrants en masse across major cities. And the comments reported on by the mainstream outlets were from a government minister who admitted she hadn’t even seen Mr. Farage’s comments. Andrea Leadsom MP told the BBC: “However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period  …     I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it’s really, really regrettable. “I haven’t seen it and I wouldn’t support suggesting if you vote to remain you’d be raped. Obviously that is just an outrageous thing to say. ” But Mr. Farage also said nothing of the sort. What he did suggest however, is that the vast numbers of migrants currently in Europe, with millions more yet to come, would be able to get to Britain in a matter of years under European Union free movement rules. In most countries, migrants can obtain passports in under five years, with some as little as two. After that, they are free to move around Europe as they see fit: including to Britain. “There are some very big cultural issues,” Mr. Farage told the Telegraph, before the paper’s reporter asked him if he thought a Cologne style attack could happen in the United Kingdom. Mr. Farage replied: “It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue. ” While the German government has tracked whether crimes were committed by German nationals or   or illegal immigrants, the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom told Breitbart London they do not hold such detail on crime statistics in Britain.

"Symantec to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion. Symantec’s security software often comes bundled with personal computers. As a result, the company has suffered as consumers use mobile devices more than traditional computers. While Norton remains profitable, its sales have been falling.    ”(Norton) had been declining with the declines in PC market share. This acquisition brings $660 million in revenue to the consumer business and returns it to longer sustainable growth,” Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview. Reuters was first to report earlier on Sunday that Symantec was in the lead to acquire LifeLock.  Symantec’s purchase of LifeLock is in line with its efforts to diversify its offerings. In August, it bought Blue Coat Inc, which helps firms maintain security over the internet, in a $4. 65 billion deal. Clark previously held the top job at Blue Coat, and made the switch after the deal closed. Based in Tempe, Arizona, LifeLock offers services such as monitoring new account openings and   applications in order to alert consumers about unauthorized use of their identity. It also works with government agencies, merchants and creditors to remediate the impact of identity theft. Fran Rosch, executive vice president of Norton Business Unit, said that Symantec had dabbled in identity security but had nowhere near Lifelock’s 4. 4 million members.  ”We had to extend our value proposition. It was a no brainer for us to get back to growth,” Rosch said. Symantec expects to finance the transaction with cash on balance sheet and $750 million of new debt.  The Mountain View,   company has been moving away from what is sees as more commoditized services, selling its data storage business Veritas in January to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP ( ) for $7. 4 billion.   firm Silver Lake Partners has also made a $1 billion investment in the company in two parts this year. Symantec said the LifeLock deal is not expected to have a material impact on its financial results next year, and reaffirmed its fiscal year 2017 and 2018 guidance. The deal also represents a victory for activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which had pushed LifeLock to explore its options. Symantec was advised by Citigroup ( ) and JP Morgan ( ) along with Bank of America ( ) Barclays Plc ( ) and Wells Fargo ( ). LifeLock was advised by Goldman Sachs ( ).    (Reporting by Liana B.

"Renewable fuels are part of an ‘America first’ energy plan | TheHill. Enactment of the Renewable Fuel Standard in Congress did more than save money at the pump and clean up the air for consumers, it also helped boost demand for U.S. corn and soybeans which, in turn, increased prices received by American farmers.  By every measure, increasing the production and use of homegrown renewable fuels has spurred economic growth for U.S. farmers and supported high-skill, high-wage jobs in rural communities. When the use of renewable fuels is curbed, the opposite is true.  Starting in 2013, economic insecurity spread across rural America because the Environmental Protection Agency took implementation of the RFS off-track, reducing annual renewable volume obligations (RVOs) below levels established by Congress.  During this period, EPA sided with oil companies that claimed infrastructure constraints and the mythical E10 “blend wall” prevented higher ethanol blends, such as E15 and E30, from being used in the marketplace.  As a result, leading biofuel groups were forced to sue the Obama administration’s EPA.  This litigation is ongoing and oral arguments were held last week by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A court decision is expected later this year. The timing of EPA’s mismanagement of the RFS was awful and the consequences have been worse.  While EPA was riding the brakes on the RFS, the productivity of American farmers led to record-high corn crops in 2015 and 2016.  Supplies grew while demand and farm income fell.  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, surplus stocks of corn will swell to a 30-year high of 2.4 billion bushels and corn prices will fall to a 10-year low in 2017. Liquidity ratios and working capital have deteriorated to their weakest levels since 2002 and the value of farm sector assets is expected to decline by $32 billion in 2017.  Farm debt is mounting and will represent about 20 percent of farm income this year.  The share of farm loans that are delinquent is creeping up and reports of farm auctions have been on the rise. Net farm income has dropped from $124 billion in 2013 to an expected $62 billion in 2017, a decrease of nearly 50 percent since EPA took the RFS off-track.  As some will remember, similar conditions forced Congress to authorize yearly ad hoc economic emergency disaster payments to farmers between 1999 and 2002 and required additional spending of $73.5 billion in the 2002 Farm Bill to avert economic collapse in rural America.  It was enactment of the RFS in 2005 that restarted the rural economy and allowed farmers to profit from the free market versus relying so heavily on government payments.  The lesson learned is that increasing the demand for renewable fuels leads to higher market prices for farmers and reduced taxpayer spending on farm program payments.  Growing the renewable fuels market in 2017 is even more critical given the uncertainty created by efforts to renegotiate existing trade pacts. While we are hopeful that these new negotiations will lead to better trade opportunities, the uncertainty in the near term will impact the U.S. farm economy which makes a strong and growing market for ethanol-blended fuel even more important. To restore badly needed economic security to rural America, EPA and Congress should take a number of steps.   First, Congress must reject any attempt to reduce or repeal the RFS.  To get the RFS back on track, the Trump administration needs to make good on its campaign promise to set and keep RFS volumes at statutory levels.  Likewise, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt needs to follow through on the statement made during his confirmation hearing “to honor the intent of the RFS statute…, use RFS waivers judiciously, and honor RVO timelines.” Second, legislative or regulatory action must be taken so E15 and higher blends of ethanol have access to the market.   Retailers want to sell E15 in the summer months because the fuel is less emitting and lower cost than E10 and straight gasoline, but EPA’s current interpretation of its Reid vapor pressure (RVP) rule handcuffs them.  This RVP regulation is the most burdensome hurdle preventing more immediate growth of E15 use nationwide.  Bipartisan legislation is pending in Congress to fix this problem and EPA has options at its disposal to make a commonsense regulatory change that would allow consumers to have access to E15 and other lower cost fuels that improve air quality.  Action needs to be taken soon. A third hurdle impeding the use of higher ethanol blends is the mountain of EPA red tape over the approval process for new certification fuels and the registration of those fuels.  EPA needs to streamline its fuel petition process and eliminate unreasonable criteria for approval of high-octane fuels, such as E25-E40, that currently discourages innovation and obstructs the ability for new efficient high-octane fuels to compete in the marketplace.  Jennings is executive vice president of the American Coalition for Ethanol.

"WH national security adviser: Iran is ’on notice’. Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn condemned Wednesday Iran’s recent ballistic missile test launch, calling it a ”provocative” breach of a UN Security Council resolution. Flynn called the launch the latest in a series of provocative moves by Iran that have included backing Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked US allies. ”As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,” Flynn said from the White House briefing room. Flynn did not say whether the US would take action beyond a verbal warning, and three senior administration officials, speaking on background, said Wednesday that they are still in the early stages of determining what action the US should take in response. ”We are considering a whole range of options. We’re in a deliberative process,” one of the officials said. Those options include financial measures and economic sanctions, and the officials said the administration would not take any options off the table, including a military response. They also stressed that a violation of the UN Security Council Resolution on Iranian ballistic missile activity would not impact the Iran nuclear deal. One of the officials said Flynn’s warning on Wednesday delivered from the White House    one that might typically be issued by diplomats    was intended to reflect ”the level of importance that this administration believes this issue warrants.” ’Provocative’ Iran’s Foreign Ministry insisted Tuesday that Sunday’s missile test was ”solely for defensive purposes,” and not a violation of the UN Security Council resolution which bars Iran from testing ”ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.”  President Barack Obama’s administration one year ago enacted financial sanctions on 11 people and companies involved in Iran’s ballistic missile program after the country conducted two test launches of ballistic missiles. That came after the UN determined in late 2015 that those launches were in violation of the Security Council resolution. The UN Security Council Resolution is not part of the Iran nuclear deal, but a separate security council measure. Flynn did not signal whether the US would take any concrete actions    military or diplomatic    to counter what he described as ”provocative” Iranian actions, but he did criticize the Obama administration for having ”failed to respond adequately to Iran’s maligned actions.” Flynn added that Iran’s actions threaten stability in the region and place American lives at risk, and said Iran was ”on notice.”  ”The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” he said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer added Wednesday that the US won’t ”sit by and not act on those actions.” Flynn’s warning comes as forces from the US, British, French and Australian navies engage in exercises in the Persian Gulf. A total of 17 warships from the four nations are participating in the exercises, named Unified Trident, led by the UK’s amphibious assault ship HMS Ocean, according to a US Navy press release. The drills are designed to ”ensure the free flow of commerce” through waterways of strategic interest to the entire world, the US Navy release said. The commander of Iran’s navy, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, warned the four navies not enter Iran’s territorial waters, according to a report from   Press TV. Iran’s Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan referenced the new US administration in telling Iran’s independent Mehr News Agency the allied exercise would not be successful. ”Under the situation created in the wake of the presidency of Donald Trump, Persian Gulf littoral states are somehow concerned about the future and the European countries are interested in cementing their presence in the region and giving some form of reassurance to their allies,” Dehghan is quoted as saying. ”These drills will have no outcome for them,” Dehghan said. Tensions have been on edge around the Persian Gulf this year. In early January, the US   destroyer USS Mahan fired warning shots at Iranian boats near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow entrance to the Persian Gulf. The five Iranian boats came ”within 900 yards or so” of the Mahan, which was sailing with two other US ships, a Pentagon spokesman said at the time. A US warship also fired warning shots at Iranian vessels in an incident last August.",-1.0
"Giuliani stands by Obama comments.  (CNN) Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America.  ”My secretary has received some death threats,” Giuliani said in a brief interview by phone. But the former mayor emphasized the majority of the voice mails left at his office were supportive of his remarks. Giuliani did not say whether he alerted police to the threatening calls. CNN cannot confirm whether the threats were made.  As for his initial remarks that ignited the firestorm, spoken at a private dinner for Wisconsin’s Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential contender, Giuliani offered no apologies.  ”I don’t regret making the statement. I believe it,” Giuliani said. ”I don’t know if he loves America,” he added.   ”I don’t feel the same enthusiasm from him for America,” he continued during the interview.  Giuliani said he didn’t mind that his comments became public.  At the dinner, he said, were   members of the news media, including CNBC anchor Larry Kudlow who, Giuliani said, was the event’s moderator.  The former mayor said he’s received calls congratulating him for his remarks, including one from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. A spokesman for the Louisiana governor confirms Jindal did speak with Giuliani by phone.  While the spokesman said Jindal did not endorse everything the former mayor said about Obama, he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president’s leadership on Islamist radicalism. ”The Governor did call him and they did speak,” spokesman Curt Anderson said.   ”(Jindal) wanted to buck him up because he knows everyone is in a rush to condemn him.  The Governor acknowledges that not everything that the Mayor said was good, but he believes that Guiliani is a great leader and that this rush by the left and the media to condemn and marginalize him is ridiculous,” Anderson said. ”In short, the Governor is not going to throw Guiliani overboard for saying some inadvisable things,” Anderson continued. Jindal, according to this spokesman,”believes that the President loves this country and that the President has proven to be an inept and incapable commander in chief.” Anderson says Jindal agrees that ”Guiliani asked a very important question which the press has glossed over    it was this    ’What’s wrong with this man that he can’t stand up and say there’s a part of Islam that’s sick? ’”  ”The Governor believes this is question that needs to be answered,” Anderson said. John Catsimatidis, a tycoon in the grocery store industry who sponsored the event, also called to say Giuliani was saying what was on other people’s minds, the former mayor added.  Earlier this week, the former mayor laid into Obama’s foreign policy as coming from a leader who is somehow disenchanted with the country he leads.  ”I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America. He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country,” Giuliani said at the dinner.  Giuliani’s Obama critique puts 2016ers in a bind, In his latest comments to CNN, Giuliani noted he is not running for president in 2016.  But he tried to explain why he made the comments.  Giuliani said he was disgusted with Obama’s response to the executions of Egyptian Coptic Christians by ISIS and the attack on a Jewish market in Paris by radicals inspired by the terrorist group.  The President erred, Giuliani maintains, in not holding a press conference to immediately denounce those acts of terrorism.  ”Islamic extremism is not an abstraction,” he continued.  By contrast, Giuliani pointed out, the President did make comments to the press after the racial unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.   ”There’s something wrong with the rhetoric here,” Giuliani said.  ”I think the President is a very poor leader,” Giuliani added, saying Obama doesn’t measure up to past presidents Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton.  Opinion: Giuliani’s outburst is ugly, divisive, Giuliani said some of his comments were based on Obama’s autobiography, ”Dreams of My Father,” which he said he read during the 2008 campaign at the urging of his wife, who predicted the   senator would be the Democratic nominee.  Giuliani said the White House owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about Obama during the 2008 campaign. Giuliani said that claim from White House spokesman Eric Schultz was not true.  ”I think they should apologize to me,” Giuliani said.  On Friday, the White House sharply criticized Giuliani’s comments.  ”I can tell you that it’s sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature, and even admiration, tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.    ”And the truth is, I don’t take any joy, or vindication, or satisfaction from that. I think, really, the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today,” Earnest added.  Giuliani’s fall from America’s Mayor",-1.0
"The ministers of Trump's truths. Forget the theater, the palace intrigue, the stumbles. One thing you should know on Day 40 (and soon the 40th night) of President Trump: This is Bannon-Miller presidency in the making. Think about the dark view of the state of the world, of the state of our nation, of the state of media. This is the worldview of the Stephens — chief strategist Bannon and policy guru Miller — trumpeted by Trump. We see this in ... A budget draft that guts the regulatory state to fund a defense build-up. A war without end with the media, where allies like Breitbart get Oval Office face time and frenemies like the New York Times get endlessly tagged as evil. A clamp-down on immigrants, visitors from Muslim countries, trade, companies exporting jobs. A dismissive view of the U.N. and conventional views on China. The slow destruction of political norms, and Washington customs and niceties. Stephen Miller, 31, is the ""Minister of Truth"" on the cover of the forthcoming Bloomberg Businessweek, profiled by Josh Green. Bannon, of course, is quoted extensively. ""Economic nationalism, as defined by Trump's advisers, would seize the levers of government and the presidential bully pulpit to direct resources to helping marginalized U.S. workers. ... Miller's us-vs.-them vision for overhauling U.S. policy and his combative defense of Trump have all the elements of a compelling talk-radio rant. ""But actually enacting Trump's agenda would deliver a tremendous shock to the political system, one sure to spark massive resistance. ... For all the impact his executive actions have had on U.S. immigration policy, the bulk of his agenda is legislative—and it has slowed to a crawl, despite Republican majorities in the House and Senate. ... 'I understand his vision, his ideas,' Miller says. 'I can be an implementer.'"" Classic Miller: ""I'm prepared to go on any show, anywhere, anytime, and repeat it, and say the president of the United States is correct. One. Hundred. Percent.""",0.0

Kids need to reclaim their data and security… especially at school
Why metadata should not live forever The news of the DNC email hack has put the issue of securing the US election systems against foreign attacks and boosting the resilience of national critical infrastructure front and center. It has also raised the stakes for solving the shortage of cyber security professionals that can actually address these risks. One way to widen the cyber talent pipeline is to start education early, very early in fact. Today, most kids are avid technology users, spending countless hours on their devices, creating content and sharing deeply personal data — photos, networks and locations. Yet, very few have looked inside of a computer or had a chance to reverse-engineer an app to understand how it can be broken into, compromising its users. r00tz Asylum, the longest running kids hacker conference taking place at the heart of DEF CON, has steadily grown to become one of the largest spaces for kids to explore cyber security, cryptography, hardware hacking among many other topics. r00tzhas consistently been one of the most diverse programs in information security where girls and boys are equally supported to explore ethical hacking. Although hacking is yet to overcome its bad rap among the general public, r00tz kids seem to be immune to its influence, embracing their newly acquired skills as superpowers that come with great ethical responsibility. When they learn how easily the air traffic control systems can be compromised, they think of it as a personal security issue that may affect their families flying home from Las Vegas — something they now know can be solved with strong encryption and authentication protocols. For young hackers that come to DEF CON every year, it requires no proof that without understanding how to break a system and then put it back together, it is impossible to make the tech they love and use more secure and resilient. Learning how to identify the weak points across web servers and break into designated websites teaches r00tz kids playing at this year’s pentester workstation to detect the attackers and understand their game. Given how complex and interdependent the technology space that today’s kids will inherit has become, the r00tz mission is rather focused on instilling a hacker mindset than teaching a specific set of skills. And more than anything, the hacker mindset is about having the freedom to innovate and break things to understand how they work and how they can be made better. Tellingly, two of the longest lines were for the junkyard and soldering stations where kids could break computers apart to see a motherboard for the first time and then (maybe) put them back together. As one of the r00tz kids explained: “When we see a computer, we normally just see a box that works. But exploring what is inside was actually super empowering. Normally, we are never given a chance to break stuff without consequences. But that’s what helped me understand how the technology I use all the time actually works.” Another r00tz hacker perceptively quipped: “Many kids at school don’t understand that the apps they use a million times a day are created by coders. They think it is just magically there”. Indeed, it is much easier for kids to see themselves as creators rather than only consumers of technology when they have an idea of what is under the hood of a karaoke or a photo-sharing app. Over the past 6 years, r00tz kids have learned from world-renowned hackers who openly share their “war stories” because they strongly believe it doesn’t benefit the global community if only a handful of people have critical knowledge. This year, almost half of r00tz speakers were kids – form 9-year-old Emmett sharing his experience of setting up Capture the Flag to 16-year-old GajetGirl talking about 3D printing. Speaking at the end of this year’s r00tz, the legendary Dan Kaminsky challenged the kids to “go ahead, break stuff, that is how I got to where I am … Understand how it really works, understand how it really breaks. But also understand that your job doesn’t stop there. We have the Net to protect — you are going to be in a position to make things better.” Many of the r00tz kids are eager to do just that.",0.0

"The Stickiest Hit of 2016 Is Appropriately Depressed . In a recent post at Psychology Today, the author William Poundstone mentioned the Chainsmokers song “Closer” when illustrating research indicating that people stop listening to new music around age 33. Poundstone’s point was that a big swath of the American population may be completely unfamiliar with the song that’s No. 1 in the country —  and, as of its   week at the top of the charts, the   No. 1 song of 2016 (placing it among the   No. 1 songs of all time). Of all the songs that might be used to illustrate an age gap, “Closer” is a particularly good one. That’s partly because it’s about aging —  or rather, not aging, with the chorus insisting “we ain’t ever getting older” as the singers describe melancholically shacking up with a    ex of four years prior. Another reason is that “Closer” is a smartly crafted artifact of its time, totally suited to 2016 pop —  which, in turn, has lately quite suited the drained and pissy national mood. The Chainsmokers are the DJs Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, who broke through with the 2014 novelty single “#SELFIE,” a jackhammering EDM ode to smartphone narcissism. They’ve since transitioned to more “serious” material with successful singles including “Roses” and “Don’t Let Me Down,” both of which like “Closer” are wistful   dance tracks anchored by an    female vocalist. In the process, Taggert and Pall have transcended the facelessness that sometimes afflicts EDM producers by giving   interviews such as one with Billboard, which features the quote, “We’re just frat bro dudes, you know what I mean? Loving ladies and stuff. ” The Riches of ’Cheap Thrills’ “Closer,” released in July, is a vocal duet between Taggart and the singer Halsey, whose song “New Americana” felt   to conquer Instagram captions by swiping Lana Del Rey’s sound while rhyming “Nirvana” with “legal marijuana. ” Taggart and the other writers of “Closer” have taken cues from that song with regards to the power of multisyllabic couplets about rock bands that remind millennials of middle school, pairing “  song” with “Tucson” for the most memorable line of “Closer. ” They’ve also picked piano chords reminiscent of Justin Bieber’s “Where Are Ü Now” and lifted a hook from The Fray’s 2005 smash “Over My Head (Cable Car),” resulting in a sound   with the blasé,      vibe of the year in pop from Drake to Zayn to Rihanna. Most distinctive about “Closer” might be its structure, which pivots from misty emotional reveries to passages of clear, specific storytelling from opposite points of view. The song’s quick scramble to the No. 1 spot in late summer triggered smart analysis from the likes of Slate, The New Yorker, and The New York Times. The uninitiated might want to start with the Switched on Pop podcast, where the songwriter Charlie Harding and the musicologist Nate Sloan dissect how “Closer” uses a    melody and production that mimics the   narrative of the lyrics. They also address perhaps the most important gimmick in recent hitmaking: the   “pop drop,” where in addition to a singalong chorus there’s a recurring section of rhythmic excitement and distorted vocals delivering a wordless earworm. It’s easy to be cynical about a song as precisely   as this one, especially when its creators go around talking about how they’re obsessed with their own “metrics. ” But there’s no denying that the song’s meaning —  a momentary pleasure can be bittersweet in its reminder of mortality —  is authentically connecting with listeners. Which says something, given how subtly spiteful the lyrics are: The only real distinguishing feature of the girl Taggart’s singing about, supposedly inspired by actual exes of the band members’ is that she can afford neither car nor tattoo nor mattress. They’re hooking up for the temporary escape, and he seems a bit embarrassed by it. Even in this focus, the song fits its time. The year has been defined in large part by songs that share the Chainsmokers’ message of trying to hold on to vitality in the face of draggy capitalist realities, whether those realities are the   items of this song or the    grind looming behind Sia’s “Cheap Thrills” or Twenty One Pilots’ “Stressed Out” or the two big “Work” hits of 2016. Weariness is the hottest commodity in new pop —  maybe the   crowd should tune in after all.",-0.5
"Fossilized shells show big predators kept picking on small prey. Predators in the oceans grew significantly bigger 540 million years ago, while their prey became faster and trickier, according to a new study in Science. It's one of the first pieces of evidence to support a popular evolutionary hypothesis that's been difficult to prove: the notion that, as predators evolve to become bigger and more powerful, the entire predator-prey relationship up and down the food chain also changes. Researchers were able to observe in the fossilized record how ocean predators increased in size over millions of years and how that drove more changes down the food web. How they did it: Researchers studied the attack marks - known as ""drill holes"" - in 7,000 different fossilized shells from the Phanerozoic period 540 million years ago. During that era, they found that that the predators of these prey had all grown significantly bigger. Meanwhile, the prey had all remained the same size – though they had also become more mobile and better able to burrow in order to escape the ever-growing predators. Over the last 500 million years, the ratio between the size of marine predators and their prey increased 67-fold.",0.0
"Tom Price's confirmation hearing just got more interesting. President Trump's Health and Human Services nominee was already going to face more questions about his stocks and his ethics. But now, the Senate Finance Committee will have even more reason to grill him on policy this morning — thanks to that Obamacare executive order Trump put out late Friday night. Like, what does it really mean? And how would Price apply it once he's running HHS? Everyone is confused: Democrats aren't the only ones wondering what Price will say. Caitlin Owens reports that Republican Sen. Susan Collins called the executive order ""really confusing,"" and said that ""until there's a secretary in place...it's very difficult to say what the impact of the executive order is going to be."" Other topics they'll throw at Price: Republicans plan to ask him about Trump's Obamacare replacement plans, of course, but also about his thinking on the future of Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats will hammer him on the executive order and his stocks, but they'll also try to squeeze in a few questions on Price's plans for Medicare, Medicaid, and drug prices. (Will Price sound any more enthusiastic about negotiating drug prices than he did last week?) The biggest danger: More ""Price is Right"" headlines. Not from me, though. I hate those.",0.0
"Cisco is buying CliQr for $260M to expand its hybrid cloud management solutions – TechCrunch. Some more consolidation underway in the world of enterprise cloud services, and specifically in the area of hybrid cloud. Today Cisco announced that it is buying CliQr, a provider of application management solutions for hybrid cloud environments, for $260 million in cash and equity awards. The deal, which is expected to close in Q3 of this year, will see the CliQr team become a part of Cisco’s Insieme business unit reporting to Prem Jain. CliQr was already working with Cisco, with the company’s solutions integrated across several of Cisco’s data center switching and cloud solutions, the company said. CliQr had raised just over $38 million from investors that include Google Ventures, Foundation Capital, InstantScale Ventures, Polaris Partners and Translink Capital. CliQr, based out of San Jose, was founded in 2010 but only came out of stealth in 2012. While many businesses today are moving services off their own servers and into cloud-based evironments, more often than not enterprises are taking a combined approach using on-premise, cloud and third-party servers to run their IT. This is leading to a lot of M&A activity in the hybrid cloud space but also companies organically expanding their service offerings in this field to meet customer demands. Indeed, the acquisition of CliQr comes at a time when we’re seeing some other interesting moves from other enterprise services companies to build up their hybrid cloud services. Last week, IBM announced a deep partnership with VMWare specifically to expand its own hybrid cloud offering (and it’s also made some acquisitions of its own in the space, for example buying Cleversafe last October). RedHat acquired Ansible also last October. And Microsoft’s acquisition of Aorato was also aimed at improving its security offerings for hybrid cloud environments. “Customers today have to manage a massive number of complex and different applications across many clouds,” said Rob Salvagno, vice president, Cisco Corporate Development, in a statement. “With CliQr, Cisco will be able to help our customers realize the promise of the cloud and easily manage the lifecycle of their applications on any hybrid cloud environment.” CliQr’s approach, as Cisco describes it, is to provide customers with a single platform, called the CloudCenter, to manage applications across hybrid IT environments. The idea with CliQr is that it’s meant to grow with the business’s own gradual move to the cloud by making it easy to move application by application into a cloud environment, making it an attractive upsell. Cisco says it will keep CliQr operational as it is today and integrate it further into its data center business. The is Cisco’s 195th (!) acquisition.",0.0

"New Blacklist: Bucknell Class President Removed After Bringing Conservative Speakers to Campus, Taking Job at Breitbart - Breitbart. Tom Ciccotta, a student at Bucknell University, has been removed from his position as Junior Class President after taking up a   job at Breitbart Tech and inviting conservative speakers to campus. [With no practical reason to remove Ciccotta (his term was due to expire in just one week with the end of the semester) it seems that the Bucknell student has become the latest victim of   sentiment on campus, targeted for little more than being an effective conservative organizer.  Ciccotta was, by the numbers, a dedicated and   member of Bucknell’s student government. He put in over 100 hours over the course of this semester alone and attended over 75 meetings since January. He also organized two major social events for Bucknell’s junior students, despite only being obliged to organize one. Ciccotta managed these commitments despite taking five classes at Bucknell instead of the usual four, managing the campus radio station, and acting as president of the College Republicans  —   all in addition to his writing commitments at Breitbart. Yet his superiors have now removed him from his position just one week before his term as president was due to expire. Their reason? Ciccotta had missed 4 (out of 79!) meetings this semester. One of those was due to a scheduled job interview with Alex Marlow, the    of Breitbart News. Another was missed due to Ciccotta organizing a campus event with conservative personality Steven Crowder. A further meeting was missed due to Ciccotta’s work commitments at Breitbart, which required him to travel to Atlanta to attend a university event with editor Milo Yiannopoulos at short notice. Bucknell’s Student Government Constitution states that when meetings are missed, “special circumstances” must be taken into account. Other members of the student government have missed meetings because they overslept, only informing their superiors after the fact  —   via text message. They, unlike Ciccotta, have not been removed from their positions. Which of course raises the question: is having slept in more of a “special circumstance” than organizing   events on campus and developing one’s career? Furthermore, why was Ciccotta suspended just a week before his term was due to expire, when he had no more work left to do? To answer these questions, Breitbart reached out to the two individuals who made the decision, Student Body President Mark Merino and Student Body   Nigel Ravida. Merino, responding to our email, informed us that Ciccotta’s removal had nothing to do with his invitation of conservatives or his job at Breitbart. “This is strictly an issue regarding attendance,” he said. He also assured us that other students who missed meetings have been “met with and addressed very directly. ” Merino’s emailed response contained a signature listing his preferred “gender pronouns” as “ ” a popular device used by members of the radical identitarian left who believe that one’s gender can be chosen or changed. Responding, Tom Ciccotta told Breitbart Tech that in all but one of his absences, he notified his superiors well ahead of time. On occasions where he missed meetings due to work commitments at Breitbart, Ciccotta said that Merino and Ravida “seemed supportive. ” It appears that supportiveness has now changed  —   or, perhaps, was never quite genuine to begin with. Merino also claims that Ciccotta was “asked to resign. ” Yet Ciccotta maintains that his removal was not a matter of choice on his part: he was removed from Bucknell’s student government website before he was informed of the decision. In other words, he didn’t resign  —   he was thrown out out. In a   email, we asked Merino why Ciccotta was suspended so close to the end of his term as junior president. We also asked whether any other member of Bucknell’s student government had ever been removed for missing 4 meetings out of 79. Merino has yet to respond. AN EXECUTIVE DECISION  According to one member of Bucknell’s student government who attended the meeting in which Ciccotta was removed, the decision was made without a vote of the student Executive Committee.  According to Ciccotta, he was initially told by Merino that there was no way to reverse the decision, despite the fact that the Student Government Constitution clearly outlines an appeals process. Following Breitbart’s request for comment, it appears that Merino’s position has changed: he recently emailed Ciccotta to inform him that he may, if he wishes, appeal the decision at the next meeting of the Executive Committee. If a vote does take place, the president and   are likely to face pressure from a growing number of Bucknell students who are upset with their decision to remove Ciccotta. BACKLASH, Despite his wide range of extracurricular commitments, Ciccotta is widely perceived as an efficient and   member of Bucknell’s student community. Ethan Wise, a member of Bucknell’s class of 2017, said, “It’s great to have students who have the will and follow through to invite big names to campus like D’Souza, Milo, and Crowder. Tom has been instrumental in bringing all three to campus this year. ” Brady Wozosky, another member of Bucknell’s student government, said the decision to suspend Ciccotta just a week before the end of term was “really unfair. ” Bucknell’s Junior Class   also waded in to the row, accusing Mark Merino of “just doing this to hurt Tom. ” FACULTY HOSTILITY, Ciccotta first encountered trouble at Bucknell when, as president of the College Republicans, he invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak on campus. The visit from Yiannopoulos, whose tour of US campuses has caused   leftwing students to organize therapy sessions in his wake, led to panic from Bucknell administrators and faculty, who organized a range of bizarre restrictions on the event. The college Republicans were prohibited from filming the talk, and students were not allowed to ask Milo any questions verbally  —   they had to be scribbled on the back of index cards. Yiannopoulos was also prohibited from speaking to students    after the event and was escorted out of the building by campus officials as soon as his talk concluded. After organizing the event, Ciccotta faced a backlash from Bucknell’s faculty. After suggesting, in a private meeting, that the event with Milo had been Bucknell’s “best ever,” he was told by the college’s Student Media Advisor that his attitude would “isolate” the people who worked under him at the college’s radio station. He was later threatened with having his position as host of a political talk show on campus taken away over an alleged “conflict of interest. ” It was claimed, by the same Student Media Advisor, that Ciccotta’s role as the host of campus talk show Lunch Hour came into conflict with his role as Station Manager of the campus radio station. He was accused of bringing a political slant to the radio station. Ultimately, the threat wasn’t acted upon, and Ciccotta remains the host of Lunch Hour and Station Manager. CONSERVATIVE ON CAMPUS, For those who have followed our reporting on free speech and the American campus, it should be apparent that being openly conservative on campus is becoming an increasingly difficult pursuit. Trump supporters on campus now face calls for their arrest, and those who invite conservative speakers to campus are accused of damaging their fellow students’ mental health and emotional  . Far from being congratulated for adding to the intellectual and political vibrancy of their universities, conservatives on campuses are treated as pariahs. Nonetheless, judging by the early reaction from Bucknell students who have been informed of the decision to remove Ciccotta, it seems that some students have had enough of this politically intolerant status quo.

"Rust Belt Connecticut. It has become a familiar pattern in Connecticut over the last few years. Each spring, as the state’s budget dips back into the red, legislators gather in Hartford to prognosticate over the state’s fiscal viability. They fumble around for agencies to cut, for taxes to raise, for concessions from the public unions. Eventually they reach, with the help of Governor Dannel Malloy, some sort of stopgap deal, enough to paper over the wounds for the present fiscal year but woefully insufficient to address the roots of the   problem. 	Connecticut is, in many ways, a state grappling constantly with the mistakes of past policy. The classic example of this pattern is the problem of unfunded pension liabilities. Among all the states in the union, Connecticut performs especially poorly in this regard: only 35. 5 percent of its pension liabilities are funded. It’s tempting to pin the blame on current leadership, but that misses most of the story: The far more important factor is the rampant inability, or more likely unwillingness, of politicians over the last eight decades to fund the system adequately. The state has rarely, if ever, contributed the requisite amount to the system and indeed contributed nothing at all for the first 30 years of its existence. 	The typical critique goes like this: To dig itself out of its fiscal hole, Connecticut has raised taxes exorbitantly, making the price of doing business in the state untenable and creating one of the country’s worst business climates companies such as GE and Aetna are escaping these constrictions and indeed are receiving healthy sums to do so ($145 million from Boston and the state of Massachusetts in GE’s case). 	But that angle of critique gets at only a small portion of the real issue. GE and Aetna are, after all, leaving for Massachusetts and New York, not    Texas and Arizona. The real reason for leaving Connecticut is that the state has failed to prepare itself for the new, modern economy, and that to participate in the dynamism and innovation that marks certain sectors, companies must now look far afield from the suburbs of Hartford. 	Connecticut has none of what makes those cities glisten. Rather, it has for decades neglected its own cities to the benefit of its suburbs. It has done little to encourage its cities to become hubs of innovation and design. It has made a fetish of home rule and the peculiar New England system of small municipalities reliant almost solely on property taxes for revenue, a policy that has made the state synonymous with vast inequalities between even neighboring towns. Advocates of regionalization and   between municipalities have run into brick walls time and time again. Hartford and Bridgeport have stagnated and are wracked by crime, corruption, and a perennial lack of money stemming from a dearth of taxable property within city limits. New Haven, meanwhile, has managed to right the ship from the storms of the 1980s and early 1990s, thanks in no small part to the beneficent largesse of Yale University. 	The Connecticut model, so to speak, worked quite well when the suburbs were the bastion of American life  —   it is no mistake that Richard Yates’s novel Revolutionary Road,   of the 1950s, is set in tony Darien. But that era has faded, and a   urban age has taken its place. Connecticut is woefully unprepared for that. Pittsburgh, the feted champion of the new urbanism, went bankrupt in 2003 and has since undergone an impressive rejuvenation with its nadir arriving just before the boom years, the   city was in a good position to capitalize on the urban renaissance. If Hartford goes bankrupt in the next few years, as looks increasingly likely, it will come at the worst possible time, potentially squandering a rare chance at rebirth and only greasing the wheels of   and job loss. 	Though the suggestion might seem outlandish, it’s not entirely inconceivable that large swathes of Connecticut will, 20 or 30 years from now, look much like the Rust Belt does today. Certainly a set of factors points in that direction. The state has lost population for three years in a row, and the exodus is only accelerating The story is not a fiscal one, as migrants from greater Hartford are moving to more, not less, expensive places. The ongoing collapse of the retail sector, as wonderfully elucidated by Kevin D. Williamson, will hit Connecticut especially hard: The state has the highest number of shopping malls per capita in the country. Meanwhile towns and cities across the state, rural and urban alike, are plagued by the opioid epidemic, which killed nearly a thousand Connecticut residents in 2016 alone. Connecticut in 2017 seems like a state on the verge of  —   or in the middle of  —   an inexorable decline. 	All of this is to say that prosperity is not permanent. Occupying a prime position in the economy of one era does not guarantee you that same position in the next. As the world evolves around you, you must either adapt or find yourself left behind. Connecticut has failed to perform the former and now faces the risk of the latter. In the face of this threat, the   budget crisis in the halls of the capitol building can seem like something of a sideshow. There are far more pressing matters at hand.  —   Noah   is a student of modern history and politics at Yale University and an editorial intern at National Review. ",1.0
"HP reports better than expected $0.48 EPS and $11.9B revenue in Q3 – TechCrunch. After the close of the bell, technology stalwart Hewlett-Packard announced better than expected numbers in their Q3 earnings report. This comes after a relatively flat week on the public markets for the company. Analysts expected an adjusted EPS of 44 cents on $11.44 billion in revenue. Instead, HP reported an EPS of $0.48 cents and revenue of $11.9 billion. The EPS numbers reported beat HP’s internal guidance of $0.43 to $0.46 per share. Third-quarter net revenue is down 4 percent from Q3 2015. As soon as the report dropped, HP stock shot up initially in after-hours trading, seemingly reversing a downward trend that began this afternoon just after 2 PM EST. Unfortunately it didn’t last long, and investors started pushing the price back down minutes later. The company has struggled to find footing after splitting back in November of last year. The HP reporting earnings today sells printers and computers, whereas Hewlett Packard Enterprise services businesses. HP Enterprise has a $36 billion dollar market cap while HP runs about a $24 billion dollar market cap. Both companies have seen stock price growth since January, but HPE growth at 43 percent significantly outpaces the 24 percent growth seen at HP. The printer market specifically is a point of distress for traders, with HP seeing double digit revenue declines servicing the space in previous quarters. In the report, HP noted that its printing business is still struggling, but that its PC business is stabilizing. “Printing net revenue was down 14% year over year with a 20.4% operating margin. Total hardware units were down 10% with Commercial hardware units down 2% and Consumer hardware units down 14%. Supplies revenue was down 18%.” [graphiq id=”jViw0VAaaln” title=”HP Inc.

"Canadian Muslim grilled about her faith and view on Trump at US border stop. Concerns that US border patrol agents are targeting minorities have grown in the wake of Donald Trump’s executive order blocking refugees and visitors from seven   countries from entry into the US. The order caused chaos at US ports of entry when it was enacted two weeks ago and though a federal court has blocked it from being enforced, claims of aggressive, and potentially illegal, treatment have lingered.  This week, Canadian citizen Fadwa Alaoui said she was denied entry to the US after border officials asked probing questions about her Muslim faith and her views on Trump. Alaoui was born in Morocco but has lived in Canada for more than 20 years, traveling to the US regularly to visit family. But on her way to Vermont for a day of shopping with two of her children and an adult cousin, she was stopped for four hours at the border. Alaoui  —   who wears a hijab  —   said border officials asked her several questions about her faith. “He said ‘Do you practice? Which mosque do you go to? What is the name of the imam? How often do you go to the mosque? What kind of discussions do you hear in the mosque? Does the imam talk to you directly? ’” She said they also examined her phone and asked questions about Arabic videos on the device. Alaoui told them they were videos of daily prayers she had received from friends, to help her and her son as he went through chemo. An agent later explained that the videos were why she was being blocked from entry. “I felt humiliated, treated as if I was less than nothing. It’s as if I wasn’t Canadian,” she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Morocco is not one of the seven countries covered by the executive order, feeding fears that US Customs and Border Patrol has been emboldened by the decree.  “We have heard reports that CBP has been exceeding its authority or targeting Muslims and members of specific racial and ethnic communities in the chaos surrounding the implementation of the executive order,” said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney for the ACLU.  Handeyside said the reports are consistent with a trend the ACLU has observed for years at ports of entry: people from specific ethnic groups being subjected to excessive force, intrusive searches of electronic devices and questioning about their religious and political beliefs. “We have heard reports recently that those have continued or possibly gotten worse,” he said. The ACLU’s national security project director, Hina Shamsi, said the questioning she has received after the executive order was implemented was “unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in over 25 years of travel into and out of this country”. Shamsi had Pakistani citizenship, but has been a legal permanent resident in the US for more than 10 years. In that time, her work has taken her around the world for cases that directly challenge the past two presidential administrations.  “Over all those years, government officials made their views known about this work  —   often in opposition, sometimes in support,” Shamsi wrote in a blogpost. “But no government agent ever asked the chilling question I was asked this time: ‘Do you understand why someone might have a different perspective about you? ’” An average of 1. 2 million people a day try to enter the US, according to the CBP. The agency said of those, an average of between 300 and 500 are denied entry. But the circumstances that lead to those denials are murky. “In many instances, CBP officers treat the border and ports of entry as   zones, but the constitution most certainly applies at the border and each CBP officer has sworn an oath to uphold the constitution,” Handeyside said.  A CBP spokesman, David Long, said the agency does not discriminate on the entry of foreigners into the US and officers’ decisions are   by supervisors and other managers. “Although frontline officers do have some discretion in carrying out their duties, they ultimately work with a team of personnel within a    construct to achieve CBP’s mission,” he said.  Long said reports of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior are taken seriously and investigated.  In Texas, attorneys are considering taking legal action against the agency on behalf of a Jordanian teenager, who was detained for more than a week after attempting to return to his home in Houston.  Jordan is also not one of the seven countries listed in the order, but the    Mohammad Abu Khadra, was detained for two days before being moved to a juvenile immigration facility in Chicago.  Mohammad’s attorney said after being detained, the teen may have told border officials he was attending public school in the US, in violation of his tourist visa. His case is in immigration court.  The Trump administration, meanwhile, is working to expand the legal boundaries of appropriate security checks. This week, the Department of Homeland Security said it was considering forcing refugees and people from the seven countries covered in the executive order to surrender their login details for social media sites. “If they don’t want to cooperate then you don’t come in,” the DHS secretary, John Kelly, said this week.  The White House is also discussing the possibility of asking all foreign visitors, not just those cited in the order, to share social media account information and their cell phone contacts, according to CNN.  For the Canadian blocked from crossing the border to shop in Vermont, these type of searches were a shock.  Alaoui said she still hasn’t found the words to explain to her son what exactly had happened. She told the CBC: “I don’t want him to feel like we were discriminated because I raise my kids that we are all the same. We are Canadians. Yes, we have different names, but we are all the same. ”",-0.5
"Google spent about $270K to close pay gaps across race and gender – TechCrunch. Google says there are currently no “statistically significant” pay gaps at the company across race and gender. This is based on the company’s most recent pay analysis, where it looked at unexplained pay discrepancies based on gender and race and then made adjustments where necessary, Google wrote in a blog post today. In total, Google found statistically significant pay differences for 228 employees across six job groups. So, Google increased the compensation for each of those employees, which came out to about $270,000 in total before finalizing compensation planning. That group of 228 employees included women and men from several countries, including the U.S., as well as black and Latinx employees in the U.S. In its analysis, Google says it looked at every job group with at least 30 employees and at least five people for every demographic group for which Google has data, like race and gender. You can read more about Google’s methodology on its blog. Earlier this year, Google was hit with a revised gender-pay class-action lawsuit that alleges Google underpaid women in comparison with their male counterparts and asked new hires about their prior salaries. The revised lawsuit added a fourth complainant, Heidi Lamar, who was a teacher at Google’s Children Center in Palo Alto for four years. The original suit was dismissed in December due to the fact the plaintiffs defined the class of affected workers too broadly. Now, the revised lawsuit focuses on those who hold engineer, manager, sales or early childhood education positions. Prior to the class-action lawsuit, the Department of Labor looked into Google’s pay practices. Last January, the DoL filed a lawsuit against Google in an attempt to gain compensation data, as part of a routine compliance evaluation. In April, the DoL testified in court that pay inequities at Google are “systemic.” Google, however, denied the DoL’s claims that the pay inequities at the company were systemic. In June, an administrative law judge sided with Google, ruling that it did not need to hand over all of the data the DoL requested.",0.0
